				- meaning can help you identify answers to questions like 'what is the important object' or 'what is the better priority', such as:
					- question: "what concept is explanatory or prioritized in society" (specifically the question "is society about truth or teamwork?" for a person raised by wolves trying to understand society quickly to survive)
						- how would you derive the answer "teamwork is a good default, except when the team succumbs to negative group dynamics, at which point individuals/other teams external to the group need to be in position to criticize it", given the thousands of objects that could explain the function of 'optimizing society'
						- there are many interface traversals to gather output to derive the answer:
							- insight: 
								- 'over-focus on facts makes arguments & potential restrictive', 'teamwork is good for risk distribution for robust populations'
								- 'given that information is necessarily existing in the past according to the observer, and that information doesnt exist according to an observer outside the space-time, does this apply to the information system of math - is there information forming or possible information that can be captured by future number types which are gathering, where existing math is the observer looking backward'
							- system: 
								- 'teamwork has built-in incentive alignment with whats best for other people'
							- interface: 
								- 'truth is one interface, but teamwork is applicable across many'
							- function: 
								- 'teamwork is an important concept by default because it is related to a core function type, which is interaction functions'
							- concept-structure: 
								- 'teamwork as a structurized concept is based on the core structures of checking if other team members have what they need to benefit the team & maintain the team advantage, which is based on the concept of balance'
								- 'teamwork involves a network subset with aligned incentives'
							- concept
								- 'truth is related to the concept of state'
								- 'teamwork involves the concept of a group'
								- 'facts are ignored by many groups which find their trade loops more efficient without that information - the concept of a cult'
							- pattern: 
								- 'patterns of state changes are often more useful for their predictive power than state information'
							- meaning:
								- the information from the other interface traversals can help build the meaning of the priority ranking relationship between these two concepts:
									- 'facts dont mean anything to a group unless they help the group'
									- 'teams that dont assimilate the important facts quickly enough may become irrelevant enough to seem false or not real to other groups'
									- 'if an observer sees a group problem, they can save the group, and they have an incentive to, if the group is beneficial to other groups'
								- this is the meaning bc its the structure relevant to the initial concern, which was the question asked
						- now the observer can quickly figure out what to prioritize, rather than waiting for someone to explain it to them
							- vertices:
								- determinative/generative/power: does truth determine teamwork or the other way around?
								- differentiating: what is truth that teamwork is not and vice versa?
							- vertices like generative/hub/differentiating variables can shorten the distance from lack of understanding to understanding, similar to the insight paths associated with the vertices
