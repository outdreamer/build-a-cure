	- I identified the format of mixing interface components to graph a system
	- I identified useful cross-interface structures like interaction layers that could deconstruct a system quickly to generate quick understanding

- timeline of inventions
	- was taught that:
		- problems could be solved in multiple ways
			- trial & error
				- if there was a way to apply trial & error to some problems, why not other problems?
			- addressing problem cause vs. problem itself (how vs. why)
			- solving a problem using logic vs. using facts
				- identified by how I know someone is lying bc it's obvious given how logic works and how they reveal their intentions, even though it's not provable with facts (info interface) because there arent tools to measure that specific information generated by logic & intentions without better brain activity triggering & measuring tools, to find out what info is stored in which brain structures & what activities indicate which computations on that info, but statistics offers an alternative method of approximation (clustering, prediction tools, probability analysis, similarity scores)
		- problems could be solved using rules
			- math problems could be solved using rules, so why not other problems?
	- identified in:
		- 2008:
			- 'abstract network' (abstract interface) of irreducible cross-system concepts, when I began building the story/setting for my book Outdreamer, which is when I began cataloguing concepts to identify the most concise & useful set of them
			- 'perspective' structure (interface structure) when I began to examine priorities & documented the perspective structure (a filter with priorities) and realized there were multiple perspectives that were useful for solving a problem, and that these perspectives had structure, because when I was writing the story, I had to create structures to connect abstract concepts in the abstract network, and these connections followed rules of their own which had definitions/structure on the logic interface ('jumping to conclusions')
			- I wanted to automate basic tasks at school that took longer than they should have given how simple they were, like finding insights or good lines in a book quickly without reading the whole thing
		- sometime in between 2008 - 2012:
			- 'insight path' structure when I noticed patterns in innovations across systems when reading science news (& spark notes cheat sheets) when I was researching cancer & how vaccines were invented (it was made obvious by pure random accident bc the info was focused on given the inventor's perspective) & looking for ways to speed up science discoveries, and realized 'trial & error' was an example of this structure
		- 2012:
			- barclays libor rate 'insider information' news story is when I identified the structures of an information problem that made a solution possible to solve with information structures (information position, information barrier, information asymmetry) that were not the same as physical structures ('agents who know information') and how to connect those structures
				- this is the first example I can remember that made it clear that:
					- there were important & useful structures other than just functions/variables in problem-solving
					- information had absolute structure ('lies' and 'intent' were derivable using information structures & logic structures), rather than being subjective or nebulous concepts with changeable structure only as defined by humans
					- information problems could be solved with the information perspective using information structures (like 'distributing information' to resolve an 'information asymmetry')
		- 2013:
			- pitched function metadata at work (Cybernetics) in an email
			- pitched solution machine at work (Morinteresting) in a word document
		- between 2013 - 2015
			- started pitching function metadata & problem-solving structures like 'shape index' (structure interface) on social media

	- is your interface definition the same as a software interface?
		- glad you asked just so I could say:
			- no! a software interface refers to an abstract template defining a list of functions/attributes that should be implemented in order to qualify as a member of a class, or a visual graphic interface allowing the user to interact with the software, or an application programming interface allowing software programs to exchange info that makes sense to another program - in those contexts, an interface acts like a 'type', 'structure', or 'language', and is not sufficiently similar to my definition of the primary interfaces in my invention, which is 'a standardizing filter of a concept where many changes occur, which can be used to solve any problem' where other interfaces act like 'high-variation change bases'. It has some structures in common 'a software interface applies a structure, standard, language, protocol, or optimization rules to connect things like software programs/users' but ultimately:
				- an 'API' (application programming interface) is (rather than its lofty definition of a 'standard allowing software to talk to each other') just a list of public functions in real life
				- a 'user interface' is not so much a 'way for users to talk to software programs in a common visual language' but a 'set of buttons & forms that change data in a database' in real life
				- a 'class interface' is not so much a 'guiding structure for how classes relate to each other' but a 'list of functions/attributes of a software object' in real life
			- whereas, for comparison, an 'interface' in my invention is not so much a 'list of structures related to a concept' but a 'structure that enables solving all problems' (all problems can be formatted as queries on the cause interface, the intent interface, the logic interface, etc).

	- the interface (a standardizing filter) is the following:
			- the definition of the concept 
				(the definition of 'cause' for the causal interface)
			- the filter or conversion function to isolate attributes relevant to that interface 
				(causal filter would isolate dependencies on other networks)
			- the set of core objects, attributes, & functions that generate them on the interface, organized as a network
				(causal core functions like 'create' or 'change', and core objects like 'causal network')
		- standardizing an object to the causal interface means mapping how that object occupies or interacts with the network of core causal objects/attributes/functions - this means a query or traversal of those core items

	9. whats the difference between your conceptual math and 'conceptual math' as indicated here:
		- that type of 'conceptual math' is removing attributes of an object and checking for a matching object in a network map, which already exists in many programming tools, like an equal '==' check is a programming language

	- other people have applied physics & other sciences to ml before, someone would have thought of this eventually
			- yes, other people can read, but that doesnt mean they would have thought of abstracting their workflow of 'look up science concepts we havent tried before and apply them manually to the ml problem space in a way that might be useful & then check if it improves anything' (which is actually just an application of 'trial & error') or that they would have come up with a consistent, useful, effective way to abstract & automate their workflow (and all other problem-solving workflows), and tried to automate themselves, bc of their enormously unjustified egos preventing them from recognizing that their work could be automated
		- people had decades and didnt identify even one of my insights to automate problem-solving & can't come up with a new method to do so whenever they want like I can, let alone the fact that 'filters, symmetries, standards, perspectives, bases, etc' all had something in common, or identifying all the primary interfaces on which any problem could be solved - partially because their ego prohibited them from thinking about how to automate themselves, partially because I'm the best in the world at this type of thinking
		
		- isn't machine learning the automation of problem-solving?
			- I struggle to believe that no one else would have thought of a 'method to update the weights of variables & their interactions & versions after checking if the previous weights were accurate' which is the core structure that machine-learning is based on, so machine-learning shouldn't be seen as an esoteric invention that is out of reach of most people's brains, but rather a default invention that most people would have thought of if they had basic math understanding/education & tried to solve the problem of automating 'finding a prediction function' in a way that didn't involve regression or other known methods & scaled to high-dimensional spaces.
			- I also struggle to believe that someone would have thought of my invention, given how many hundreds of millions of people had the info necessary to come up with it but didn't, though it would be nice if I was living in a world full of other geniuses, it's just hard to believe given the information that people keep proving.
	
	- isnt this just a rules database or a solution database?
		- this invention has some requirements, like the code of the apply(), find(), generate(), derive() functions, and the definition routes of interfaces structures like the concept of 'truth'
		- it does not otherwise require a solution or rule database, but it can generate/use one as a source of default information about initial, standard, base, sub-optimal or specific solutions/errors or solutions/errors with other attributes
