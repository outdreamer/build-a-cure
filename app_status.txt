- to do list

	- add printed name and add applicant's file reference number to the ro/101 form for 71087 when they clarify what that means
	- upload patent application contents to the other applications 16887411 to 17016403
	- check if you need to make changes to any applications or if the changes were not accepted bc of some formatting issue & you need to re-do them
		- Kurtz said changes were unnecessary
	- implement Sheree's suggestions to claims/spec
		- include functions like 'find a causal structure' in the steps of claim 1
	- ask about fixing dependent claims of applications & other changes in:
		- national phase, re-issue or chapter 2 phase
		- save changes for preliminary amendment process in national stage
			- decide if you want to go into pct national stage (november 2022 for 46705)
