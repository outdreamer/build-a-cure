This file contains example problem-solving automation workflows & example data for those workflows.

To do:

	- select a specific problem to solve with these methods, ideally as similar a problem as possible, with different starting information in the initial problem statement.
	
	- show how to convert each solution automation method to its:

		- core functions/intents:
			- identify/differentiate, find/filter, apply/process, change/transform/format, build/combine, fit/match, derive/predict

		- core objects:
			- structures (layer, limit, origin, gap, position, systems)
			- frameworks (interface/filter)

		which when reversed is also a method to generate all solution automation methods

Identify, Find, Apply, Transform

Workflow 1: Identify problem metadata (like type), query for relevant insights & solutions to adjacent problems, transform into adjacent problem if found, solve, and convert to original problem
	
	Example: solving a multiplication problem can be framed as an adjacent multiplication problem with a pre-computed solution & an addition/subtraction problem to convert to original multiplication problem.

'''

	'''
	Workflow 1a: Transform into combination of solved problems.

		Example: social inequality can be framed as a logistics problem (optimal transport, efficiency-creation)

	'''

	'''
	Workflow 1b: Transform into combination of insights that, when combined, can solve the problem framed as a trajectory between A & B nodes on the insight network.

		Example: social inequality can be framed as a logistics problem (optimal transport, efficiency-creation)

	'''

Transform, Identify, Find, Apply, Transform

Workflow 2: Describe interface query for problem/solution.

	Example: problem uses set of types, intents, structures and solution uses information, functions, and layers to address dimensions of problem.

'''

'''
Workflow 3: Convert to information layer problem & find matching information layer solution, then convert information layer solution to structural-informational solution implementation.
	
	Example: converting the "building a website" problem into an information problem: "finding right tools and tool-assembly tools and tool-automation tools", which can be broken into 
	"correct info asymmetry" problems, "organize information" problems, "distribute information" problems, etc.

'''

'''
Workflow 4: Convert to function-intent layer problem & find matching intent layer solution, then convert intent layer solution to structural-informational solution implementation.

	Example: indexing functions by intent converts the "building a website" problem into a function structure matching & alignment problem, as well as a problem of organizing function access by intent.

'''

	'''
	Workflow 4a: Vectorize by input/output/intent

		Example: indexing functions by intent converts the "reduce duplicate lines in these files" problem into a logical information filter problem.

	'''

'''
Workflow 5: Convert to structure layer problem & find matching structure layer solution, then convert structure layer solution to structural-informational solution implementation.

	Example: Match attributes of problem with structure (such as a circle system), then find structure that solves the problem structure (like a triangle system), and convert solution structure to implementation on the combined structural-information interface.

'''

'''
Workflow 6: Convert to concept layer problem & find matching concept layer solution, then convert concept layer solution to structural-informational solution implementation.

	Example: Start with concepts required or start with structure required, then convert to other interface with interface query (or directly if concepts are already mapped to structures in your resource set).

'''

'''
Workflow 7: Convert to pattern interface (insight paths, solution patterns, problem patterns, problem-solution matching patterns) starting with known patterns for this problem type & core functions of solutions.

	Example: Applying sub-system patterns, applying matching patterns, applying structure-finding patterns, etc - as a way to automate logic in the absence of specific logic coded for this solution.

'''

'''
Workflow 8: Convert to causal interface & derive solution query on that interface, then apply causal solution query to find structural-informational solution implementation.

	Example: Identify causal shapes (or network of possible shapes), then resolve causal trajectories on those shapes to find causal stack of a problem attribute/object/rule.

'''

'''
Workflow 9: Convert to attribute interface, converting problem & available solutions to attribute vector sets, then match neutralizing attribute vector sets after checking impact on problem space.

	Example: Identify attribute metadata (attribute type, causation, cooperation, variance patterns & shapes, probability distribution, potential, etc) and convert attributes to vector network for the problem attributes, then find matching solution attribute networks that could neutralizing the problem attribute network.

'''

'''
Transform, Identify, Find, Apply

Workflow 10: Convert to system interface, derive & describe system in which problem occurs using system analysis (identify core functions, vertices, conflicts, structures (layers/limits/gaps), variance shapes & sub-systems) and interface query for that system, then solve problem by adjusting system.

	Example: a system analysis insight like "if you make a boundary adjustment to this system, it solves a problem of variance injection at this injection point" can be applied once the system is described.

'''

Identify, Find, Transform, Apply, Find, Transform

Workflow 11: Identify (abstract/contextual) interface combination that will prove most useful for solving this problem, frame problem on those interfaces, and use interface queries to find solution query, then convert solution query to structural-informational solution implementation.
	
	Example: The problem statement gives information on the type/attribute interfaces, so start by framing the problem on those interfaces as well as the pattern interface if there are any type/attribute patterns stored.

'''

'''
Identify, Apply, Find

Workflow 12: Analyze problem-solving strategy cost & value generated by solution, decide whether to solve problem, select a workflow from the above for a particular problem statement & resource set.

	Example: the cost of all probable solutions is higher than value generated, but this problem (web security) will continue if unaddressed, so either solving the problem or a causative problem (web protocols) is necessary.
