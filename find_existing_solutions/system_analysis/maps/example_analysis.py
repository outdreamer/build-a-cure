'''

In the patterns from system_analysis.json, you have example filters to use when reducing a problem before trying specific methods to solve it.

These are the objects to look for in order to quickly:
	- identify causes of system error
	- understand a system quickly
	- optimize a system

Examples of each filter follow:

{
	"attribute": {
		"attribute cluster": "species differentiation features tend to cluster"
		"attribute similarity": "location/agents (hospitals & staff/patients) with isolated conditions to prevent overuse of resource needed (cleaning supplies) for mixed condition (non-isolated hospitals/staff), where isolated conditions align with invalidation of cleaning supplies for that condition",
		"attribute alignment": "rotation force aligned with input force creates momentum",
		"attribute matching": "stacking objects that can make cubes in the knapsack problem to reduce unused space between objects",
		"attribute accretion": "symmetry stacking occurs to develop granular features (symmetries in the bio system like the spine/limbs)"
	},
	"concept": {
		"definition route": "",
		"definition structure": "most abstract concepts have a definition network"
	},
	"error": {
		"false similarity": "there are many routes to a shape or point which may differ on important metrics like intent",
		"false contradiction": "",
		"false potential": "",
		"false constant": "",
		"false conflict": "",
		"false category": ""
	},
	"state": {
		"state permutation": "thermostat that switches off if natural temperature is equal to set involves permuting state of temperature variable to find a case where AC/heat wouldnt be needed for intent of conserving resources"
	},
	"type": {
		"constant attribute set": "types are a set of attributes that stabilize long enough to be identifiable as a type and interact to form other types"
	},
	"problem": {
		"conflict": "",
		"competition": "",
		"distribution": "",
		"routing": "",
		"grouping": "",

	},
	"change": {

		"balance": "",
		"power": "",
		"variance injection": "",
		"variance accretion": "",
		"change demand/supply": "change occurs from triggers (phase shift, threshold, interaction) and the structures that can support them (matter state)"
	},
