'''

In the patterns from system_analysis.json, you have example filters to use when reducing a problem before trying specific methods to solve it.

Examples of each filter follow:

{
	"attribute": {
		"attribute cluster": "species differentiation features tend to cluster"
		"attribute similarity": "location/agents (hospitals & staff/patients) with isolated conditions to prevent overuse of resource needed (cleaning supplies) for mixed condition (non-isolated hospitals/staff), where isolated conditions align with invalidation of cleaning supplies for that condition",
		"attribute alignment": "rotation force aligned with input force creates momentum",
		"attribute matching": "stacking objects that can make cubes in the knapsack problem to reduce unused space between objects"
	},
	"concept": {
		"false similarity": "there are many routes to a shape or point which may differ on important metrics like intent",
	},
	"state": {
		"state permutation": "thermostat that switches off if natural temperature is equal to set involves permuting state of temperature variable to find a case where AC/heat wouldnt be needed for intent of conserving resources"

	}
}
