# Joni's License Agreement


## Intro

- I will know whether you copied or not based on standard keyword & synonym analysis, so theft and any attempts to hide it are ill-advised
- It's wise to see the information in this repository as an educational tool
- If you use the info in this repository in any way that exclusively benefits you, you will be hearing from my fearsome legal department of great power & argumentation.
- If you've misinterpreted this repo as a blueprint to feverishly copy as if it's your own work, remember that other people can see it too, and copying it is just creating a mountain of tech debt for all the companies who are stealing from it, because you weren't smart enough to acquire my company or plan a way to cooperate with other companies to reduce the implementation time (smart enough as a person, or as a team of people creating a corporate entity, bc even in aggregate your intelligence was too artificial to solve the very real problem of whether it's ok to copy my work without asking me).


## General Rules of Conduct

- If you use the info in this repository (which would only happen if you were a genius who wanted to save the world so there would be evidence of world-saving if you dared to use this repository to do so), you agree to only use it for educational purposes.


## Rights

You have rights with regard to this tool, specifically:
	- the right to come up with my work independently, in a logical way with the cognitive distance associated with human epiphanies, and not a clearly false explanations of how you came up with it using my definition of cognitive distance as a guide to forming that explanation.
	- the right to try and predict what I'll invent next, either with your defective human brain or a defective artificial brain
	- the right to tell other people I came up with my own inventions
	- the right to admit my superiority
	- all are welcome to read at their leisure, to congratulate me in a communication format that I can ignore & mass-delete, and to get mad online about how much I invented during my very brief lifetime, all while dodging endless creeps, rules, and barriers like Hercules' 12 tasks but better.


## Responsibilities

You have responsibilities if you use this tool, including but not limited to:
	- using it for the benefit of people other than yourself
	- using it for education only
	- making sure it's spread to other people who will use it correctly
