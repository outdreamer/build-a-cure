## Info shapes

  - if you become dependent on info, youre always looking backward, using
    - metrics/rules/info sources chosen in the past, with past info

## Problem shapes 

      - problems can have multiple dimensions creating the output problem shape, 
        which can occupy a network of related problems (both specific problems and problem types)

      - the problem space is the system in which the problem is relevant (can be a network of problem spaces)

      - different problem types have different default problem shapes

      - example problem type shapes:
        - a misalignment problem has at least two vectors differing in direction, where the optimal alignment is calculatable or at least the alignment is clearly improvable
        - a variance injection problem has a opening in a closed system
        - an asymmetry has an uneven resource distribution

      - if a problem has a misalignment problem and a variance injection problem, the problem shape can have both shapes in isolation, 
        or they can be merged, applied, added, mixed, intersecting, or combined in another way

      - example solution shape for problem shape:
        - for a misalignment problem, the solution shape would be:
          - a vector aligning them
          - another adjustment to the system that makes the existing misalignment a correct alignment
          - a combination of the two
        - for a variance injection problem, the solution shape would be:
          - an object (resource, function, constant) to close the opening in the system
          - an object to prevent further variance injections
          
        - for an asymmetry, the solution shape would be:
          - an optimal transport operation set to distribute the resource optimally according to the metric of symmetry

## Ethical Shapes

    - if someone attacks their neighbor:
      - the neighbor can retaliate
      - or the neighbor can recognize that the hit was not relevant to them but to prior attack chains, and hit the source of that attack chain that attacked their neighbor,
        so rather than continuing the chain, the neighbor creates a causal circle, directing consequences toward the relevant source of the problem
    - there are ethical shapes for each ethical problem type

## Insight Shapes (Unit, Paths)

  - use patterns in network structures & insight paths to predict:
    - probable missing pieces of networks
    - insight path of a route type (optimal/realistic)
    - insight path trajectory for a particular assumption set

## Interface Shapes

  - interface: filter/standard for comparison of specific attribute(s)
  - interfaces evolve when a unifying attribute (priority, cause, structure) can frame a set of developing variances
  - interfaces, standards, & perspectives are all filters
    - an interface can be specific but on the general interface network, it offers a standard for multiple related attributes or causative attributes 
      (types/intents/patterns offer a way to interact with all layers of a system)
    - whereas a perspective is focused on a very restricted set of variables, with the intention of distorting reality to highlight information that other perspectives dont make clear

## Type Shapes

## Attribute Shapes

## Logic Shapes

  - logical overlap
  - logical contradiction
  - logical limit
  - logical gap
  - logical misalignment
  - logical fallacy (false alternate path with different output metric value than original path)
  - mismatching intent & logical path (the logical path is valid, but it misses the point)
  - logical implication (assumption beyond explicit meaning)
  - logical operations:
    - building a conclusion out of logical units means each assembly step complies with the rules of the space
    - "adding a line to a line may produce a square, or an right angle, but it wont produce a circle"


## Variance Shapes
  
  - given that variance flows through systems in patterns, what are the common variance shapes, given host system type & structure + set of unknowns?


## Pattern Shapes

  - given that observed patterns often have patterns, what are the common pattern & pattern-generation shapes, given variance level & observation tools?


## Prediction Shapes

  - given that predictions are often between similarly complex systems & target metrics, what the common shapes of predictions, given system type & structure and metric type + set of unknowns?


## Certainty Shapes

  - while risk shapes store a ratio of shape coverage, certainty shapes store a compression of a shape
  - uncertainty shapes include variance gaps & questions


## Risk Shapes

  - a chain of risks (uncertainties) is a common structure seen in market patterns (such as trades, product engineering, demand assessment, & prediction markets)

  - other risk shapes include:

    - asymmetries:
      - info asymmetry (info being better than no info, all other things being equal)
      - understanding asymmetry (understanding being better than a prediction hypothesis)
      - risk chain asymmetry (luck being better than preparation, in edge cases)

    - equivalencies:
      - randomness (in input identity)
      - balance (in resource distribution)

    - variance generators:
      - risk generators (variance-producing variables, such as equal distribution of information, randomizing functions, etc)
      - complex systems (which have greater complexity than that which can be understood by its observers using existing tools) like markets
      - boundary-changing variables

    - variance reducers:
      - risk-reduction structures (using diverse models to check predictions rather than one)
      - risk-distribution structures (distributing different information to different positions/agents)
      - probable convergence/divergence points (singularity, filters, constants, etc)
      - boundaries/limits (minimizing risk & establishing probabilities)
      - optimization methods

    - variance movers:
      - categorizing functions (delegating risk to the accuracy of the function combination of variables, constants & operations)
      - probability distributions (delegating risk to accuracy of distribution selection)


## Causal Shapes

  - most causal shapes are cyclical, tensor, layer, or network-shaped rather than one-directional vector-shaped, which is why some existing methods are inherently incapable of producing system-fitted insights that wont break the system when applied (a particular drug that is not evaluated for bio-system impact, just impact on a particular pathogen or process)

  - part of the problem with using a one-directional vector to model a relationship is that the underlying parameter (usually time) may not be relevant for predicting the relationship evolution

  - rather than modeling it by a standard of changes over time, it can be modeled by a standard of changes over variance potentials
    - will a particular variance source change compoundingly or converge to a constant in all possible parameterizations of that variance source
    - does a particular variance source have the potential to generate variance or will it eventually become static in all possible implementations, 
      meaning it either:
        - doesn't exist (at any time), like a final output that doesnt ever return to interact with other systems as an input
        - is one of the few things that does exist (across all times), like a concept that never stops influencing variance


## Evaluating Shape Potentials

  - given an object and the topology of its potential emergent interactions with each other object, what is the set of potential shapes that can interact with (build, coexist, coordinate, use, neutralize, destroy, or be built by) this object, given the full range of interaction topologies and combinations of the same?

  - example: 

    - given a molecule and the topologies of its interactions with other interactable molecules, what is the function generating the set of macromolecules that molecule can contribute to the assembly of in a way that enables a high ratio of component-substitutions or component-derivation from other components in the absence of one?

      - given the full set of these generating functions, which molecules/molecule combinations are the best contributors/collaborators/derivers/substiters/hubs?

    - given a variable and the topologies of its interactions with other interactable variables, what is the function generating the set of functions that variable can contribute to the assembly of in a way that enables a high ratio of variable-substitutions or variable-derivation from other variables in the absence of one?

      - this goes beyond indexing isolated variables by metadata (such as variable type), to incorporate the metadata of variable interactions embedded in a relationship


## Specific Shapes

### Market Shapes

#### Trade loops

  - independence can be created with closed trade loops
    - the most basic example is where agent A produces everything agent B needs, and vice versa
