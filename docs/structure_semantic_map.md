# Structural-Semantic Map

    - evaluate logic complexity calculations for mapping with core/system operations

      - iteration:

        - applying a process to every item in a set = multiplication/distribution or division/standardization depending on the operation (dimension reduction/expansion)

      - conditions:

        - conditions map to branches/divergence (like type-splitting & hub nodes)

        - value added by conditions must be weighed against conditional logic isolation

        - condition order varies by dependency; some conditions must be in a certain order, some condition orders are more flexible, some conditions in a set have no order restrictions (can be in any order)

        - condition ordering rules:
          - conditions likeliest to be false come first
          - conditions verifying prerequisites/inputs to other conditions come first

      - layers:

        - embedded for loop = multiplication/distribution, but also has concept of embedding (related to system and its sub-components)

        - embedded conditions = hierarchy or route
