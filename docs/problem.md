## Problem Object

    - problem space: the system allowing the problem to occur

    - problem attributes

      - core conflict
        - the core mismatch/imbalance creating the cascading mismatches/imbalances for agents in the problem space

      - stable state
        - whether the problem can solve itself if another problem is solved or if its left alone

      - minimum information

        - given different information, you can use different methods: some methods are immune to information but most require a clear minimum
        - in a system (set of rules & objects) the minimum information can be found with the system vertices

          - these vertices can be:
            - core functions/variables
            - the intersections between core functions/variables that either reduce the set of possible functions/variables to the actual set or generate them

        - with a line in a space, you have this information:
          - the type of change
          - the change rate
          - the angle compared to a standard, like an axis
          - its distance

        - and you need to know the following to find its equation:
          - whether its a segment or the full line
          - the space its in

        - with cancer you need to know
          - its position in the system
          - its input resources
          - its limits
          - its change methods (stress-handling methods, learning methods, etc)
          - whether it converts to other objects (like other cancers or a pathogen) & how
          - its history (how did it evolve)
          - its types
          - its target priorities
          - its cooperative agents (which organisms it helps or can receive help from)
          - how it interacts with other objects (that arent immediately classifiable as resources or targets)


    - problem questions (filters):
      
      - problem type prediction for a system: given a system structure, which problem types are likely to occur?

      - what problems are not solvable?

        - in the universe, if you deployed a perfect computer to every smallest unit of matter/energy/info, what could you not compute?
          - for example, you couldnt compute the optimal combinations of all the other units in each unit, because the computation would involve observing other units in a way that might require them to do no processing while being observed, and this might prevent the computation from being completed by each unit of matter containing a computation device, such as a superposition
        - are there systems in which that problem is solvable (if you adjusted variance cascade patterns, could the uncertainty be reduced enough for it to be solvable)
        - solvable: can be generated by a set of identifiable factors
        - what is solvable is limited by what is identifiable - when identifying tools change, how does solvability change?

      - what are the available & relevant solution tools of the problem space:
        - insight filter ("extract insight from data, selecting for variance cascades")
        - pattern finder ("find a pattern with intent x or output y")
        - pattern generator ("generate probable patterns using known or likely components to explain x")
        - pattern applier ("apply this pattern to this system", "apply this insight to this solution")
          - concept combiner ("combine this strategy with this power balance")
        - selecting strategies
        - property matching for sub-intents of exploit intent 
        - perspective switching/transforms

    - problem types:

      - solvability

        - whether the problem space changes faster than existing tools can solve problems in that space

      - conflicts

        - interaction objects
          - inputs/requirements/logic/incentives/assumptions/patterns/types/priorities/exploits/interfaces

        - types

          - mismatch 
            - incorrect position/structure/rule/direction
              - example: receptor fits the correct protein but also a hostile protein because its shape is too general (a conflict of mismatched scope)

          - competition (forces pulling in different directions, limited resources)

          - opposition (neutralizing functions)

            - misaligned incentives 
              - example: monitoring function not given reason to monitor the lib building the monitoring function

            - paradox: 

              - calculating something that doesnt seem directly calculatable from existing resources (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox)

              - attributes:

                - contradiction: a significant variable misrepresented as insignificant (like time)

                  - truth of axioms change according to timing of event, but if the event happens at all, its taken as an absolute contradiction when its really a time-dependent contradiction

                  - can occur with mutually exclusive states where conflicting directions are falsely associated (falsehood of an interpretation in a scope doesnt mean falsehood of the same interpretation in a different scope)

                - self-reference: a lack of information about options

                  - 'If "this sentence is false" is true, then it is false, but the sentence states that it is false, and if it is false, then it must be true, and so on.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox
                    - true in the sense of meaningful equivalence ('this sentence' equals 'false')
                    - false in the sense of consistency between extrapolated implications ('this sentence' equaling 'false' doesnt equal 'this sentence is false' equaling 'false'

                  - this is usually a lack of information (ambiguities) about scope & alternate variable values

                    - can truth exist on a spectrum
                    - can truth apply to different sentence attributes ('this sentence' object in the sentence, the whole sentence, & sentence implications

              - the paradox of a 'list that contains all lists' seems unsolvable (the list needs to contain itself to be a complete set) until you notice that the list of lists is complete even if its missing one because that can be derived from the variation in the other lists, which describes the variables that can change

                - similar to listing n - 1 boolean values of different category values instead of n boolean values
                - the list of all lists contains the list of all lists in itself, so its structure/variables/contents each describe itself, even if its not stored as an item in the list

              - these paradoxes are an opposite object to interfaces and involve the apparent impossibility of solving a problem without solving the problem from a system perspective (deriving all possible lists in a system) rather than in isolation (listing all things)


        - resolution configurations
            - one competitor winning & replacing the other
            - compromise:
              - sharing (sharing the resource)
              - delegation (cooperating to acquire the resource)
              - differentiation (developing different ways to get the resource, such as producing it themselves)
              - agent adaptation (changing what is demanded/prioritized so conflict is invalid)
            - forfeit
            - game adaptation 
            - variance overrides (new universal enemy aligns incentives of competitors to cooperate)

      - asymmetries

        - can be framed as a conflict/mismatch between supply & demand
        - resource asymmetries (misallocated info, cause, power, variance)
        - includes questions and other inequalities
        - emergent patterns created by imbalances in usage patterns

        - example asymmetries with different params:
          - asymmetry of info (distance between info sources, such as agents specialized for a particular function needing different information)
          - asymmetry of info across time (prediction, convergence of info sources)

        - symmetries as epicenters/organizers/distributers/filters of similarity/variance
          - limits as an output of symmetries - can you calculate all symmetries, and can you calculate all limits from the set of symmetries?
          - how do symmetries evolve in a system - do they provide a standard/interface for variance to coordinate efficiently?
          - how are symmetries related to efficiency?
          - quantum entanglement occurs around symmetries & other aggregators like similarity

        - resolution configurations
          - removing resource
          - balancing resource
          - replacing resource
          - deriving & distributing resource generator
          - variance/conflict injection

      - variance injections

        - unrestricted inputs (incentive/intent/expectation gaps)
        - unhandled error types

        - resolution configurations
          - adding barrier/filter to variance source
          - distributing variance to minimize impact (distributing stressor across surface area)
          - breaking variance into subsets that match existing variance handlers
          - combining variance handlers to match variance source
          - combining variance sources to match variance handlers
