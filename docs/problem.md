## Determining minimum information to solve a problem

  - with a line in a space, you have this information:
    - the type of change
    - the change rate
    - the angle compared to a standard, like an axis
    - its distance
  - and you need to know the following to find its equation:
    - whether its a segment or the full line
    - the space its in
  - with cancer you need to know
    - its position in the system
    - its input resources
    - its limits
    - its change methods (stress-handling methods, learning methods, etc)
    - whether it converts to other objects (like other cancers or a pathogen) & how
    - its history (how did it evolve)
    - its types
    - its target priorities
    - its cooperative agents (which organisms it helps or can receive help from)
    - how it interacts with other objects (that arent immediately classifiable as resources or targets)

  - given different information, you can use different methods: some methods are immune to information but most require a clear minimum
  - problem type prediction for a system: given a system structure, which problem types are likely to occur?


## Problem Types


    - problem types:

      - conflicts

        - interaction objects
          - inputs/requirements/logic/incentives/assumptions/patterns/types/priorities/exploits/interfaces

        - types

          - mismatch 
            - incorrect position/structure/rule/direction
              - example: receptor fits the correct protein but also a hostile protein because its shape is too general (a conflict of mismatched scope)

          - competition (forces pulling in different directions, limited resources)

          - opposition (neutralizing functions)
            - misaligned incentives 
              - example: monitoring function not given reason to monitor the lib building the monitoring function

        - resolution configurations
            - one competitor winning & replacing the other
            - compromise:
              - sharing (sharing the resource)
              - delegation (cooperating to acquire the resource)
              - differentiation (developing different ways to get the resource, such as producing it themselves)
              - agent adaptation (changing what is demanded/prioritized so conflict is invalid)
            - forfeit
            - game adaptation 
            - variance overrides (new universal enemy aligns incentives of competitors to cooperate)

      - asymmetries

        - can be framed as a conflict/mismatch between supply & demand
        - resource asymmetries (misallocated info, cause, power, variance)
        - includes questions and other inequalities
        - emergent patterns created by imbalances in usage patterns

        - example asymmetries with different params:
          - asymmetry of info (distance between info sources, such as agents specialized for a particular function needing different information)
          - asymmetry of info across time (prediction, convergence of info sources)

        - symmetries as epicenters/organizers/distributers/filters of similarity/variance
          - limits as an output of symmetries - can you calculate all symmetries, and can you calculate all limits from the set of symmetries?
          - how do symmetries evolve in a system - do they provide a standard/interface for variance to coordinate efficiently?
          - how are symmetries related to efficiency?
          - quantum entanglement occurs around symmetries & other aggregators like similarity

        - resolution configurations
          - removing resource
          - balancing resource
          - replacing resource
          - deriving & distributing resource generator
          - variance/conflict injection

      - variance injections

        - unrestricted inputs (incentive/intent/expectation gaps)
        - unhandled error types

        - resolution configurations
          - adding barrier/filter to variance source
          - distributing variance to minimize impact (distributing stressor across surface area)
          - breaking variance into subsets that match existing variance handlers
          - combining variance handlers to match variance source
          - combining variance sources to match variance handlers

      - what problems are not solvable?

        - in the universe, if you deployed a perfect computer to every smallest unit of matter/energy/info, what could you not compute?
          - for example, you couldnt compute the optimal combinations of all the other units in each unit, because the computation would involve observing other units in a way that might require them to do no processing while being observed, and this might prevent the computation from being completed by each unit of matter containing a computation device, such as a superposition
        - are there systems in which that problem is solvable (if you adjusted variance cascade patterns, could the uncertainty be reduced enough for it to be solvable)
        - solvable: can be generated by a set of identifiable factors
        - what is solvable is limited by what is identifiable - when identifying tools change, how does solvability change?


## Problem solving core functions

  - insight filter ("extract insight from data, selecting for variance cascades")
  - pattern finder ("find a pattern with intent x or output y")
  - pattern generator ("generate probable patterns using known or likely components to explain x")
  - pattern applier ("apply this pattern to this system", "apply this insight to this solution")
    - concept combiner ("combine this strategy with this power balance")
  - selecting strategies
  - property matching for sub-intents of exploit intent 
  - perspective switching/transforms
