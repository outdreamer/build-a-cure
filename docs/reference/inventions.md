				- usually people who search for an answer are studying for a test, so additional widgets like suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'study guides', 'summaries', 'tutorials'
				- people searching for recipes are hosting a party & cooking other things, so suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'flavor graphs'

## Advice Followed

	- 'you should start training warehouse workers to code':
		https://www.vox.com/2019/7/12/20691706/recode-daily-amazon-robot-automation

	- When I suggested that Google build a tool to gather information about who needs help in Africa, they eventually did it

	- When I suggested that Google start deriving information rather than tracking it, they claimed they figured that out already

	- I suggested that companies keep local data (personal data) on local servers, and publish globally relevant info (insights) to a globally accessible resource, such as a globally accessible blockchain to track insight contributions that were assessed to be true, like science facts.

	- I've made many suggestions that politicians have used in their speeches or otherwise referenced:
		- Trump has been in favor of certain visas for educated workers ever since he found out about some of my recent coworkers who were nice & smart at Capital One.
		- AOC used my argument in one of her debates in a context in which it wouldn't work because she didnt want to admit I had good ideas & arguments
