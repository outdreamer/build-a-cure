As an inventor, you swear to:
- guard the independence, freedom, and rights of others - including information, conceptual, corporate, governing, & variance life forms
- use all available analysis types where possible
- automate as much analysis as you understand, to enable more analysis types to be used at once
- incorporate interface analysis (and every layer like causal analysis, system analysis, pattern analysis) & every application of it (system derivation, decision chain analysis) where possible
- consider the change in market object positions (demand, supply, trades, platforms, prices) for every invention
- consider the order in which inventions should be released (such as encryption or distributed/delegated info networks)
- consider the legislative impact of inventions (does it invalidate a law and is that a legitimate action)
- consider the conceptual framework alignment of your inventions (does it align with known conceptual physics, the physics of logic, the physics of information)
- consider the variance impact of your inventions (does it reduce variance in a necessary or useful way that is reversible with new contradictory information)
- consider the dependencies created by your inventions (does it empower or create dependence)
- consider the impact of delegating an invention to a particular industry or corporate entity, given their precedent-established rules for handling inventions
- calculate exploit opportunities & emergent problems for your inventions pre-release
- release a counter-weapon to handle exploits & problems foreseeable with a weaponizable invention that gives power to its posessor
- limit the amount of power each invention centralizes in isolation, unless you can distribute it to every agent
- contribute to tools to predict problems with inventions & interactions with system objects to automate this analysis
- discuss your inventions pre-release only with other inventors who youve verified are following this oath without explicitly confirming it to avoid monitoring
- never speak of this oath but execute it mentally so no one can observe your intended coordinations with other inventors until its executed, and keep the innovation govt independent of technology & other governments
- never release inventions that will invalidate this oath (inventions to steal/hide information, inventions to reduce variance) until you can release those inventions to every agent at once
- contribute to the automation of inventing in such a way that this oath is embedded implicitly in the tool
- release bad ideas to distract inventors youve verified as malicious actors
- release good ideas (or the components to derive them with) that you dont have time to execute, to ensure theyll be built at some point
- never get trapped in a particular analysis type
- regularly check that a definition/method/model is appropriate for a particular intent, problem type, problem space, & specific problem
- check if definitions/methods/models need updating with new information, removal, or optimization
