## Components

- protein:

- enzyme:

	- transferase
	- polymerase
	- protease
	- amylase

- receptor:

- DNA:

- amino acid:

- electrolyte:

- blood plasma: the fluid component of blood

- interstitial fluid: the fluid between all body tissue cells 

- lymph fluid: fluid derived from interstitial fluid that flows through the lymphatic system

	- interstitial fluid enters the lymph capillaries
		- then this lymph fluid is transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes
			- where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes & circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid
				- before emptying ultimately into the right/left subclavian vein
					- where it mixes with central venous blood

	- its composition changes as blood & surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid
	- similar to blood plasma
	- lymph returns proteins & extra interstitial fluid to the bloodstream
	- lymph also transports fats from the digestive system (from the lacteals) to the blood via chylomicrons
	- bacteria may enter the lymph channels and be transported to lymph nodes, where they are destroyed
	- metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph


## Cell Types

- lymphocyte: white blood cell type with a large nucleus including nk & t & b cells, the main cell type in lymph fluid
	 - natural killer (nk) cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity)
	 - T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity)
	 - B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity)

- t-cell:

- b-cell:

- plasma:

- memory cell:

- antigen: any molecule or linear molecular fragment that can be identified by a t-cell receptor

- macrophage: white blood cell type

- antibody (immunoglobulin): 

	- y-shaped protein produced by plasma cells that neutralizes pathogens, either by binding to tag an antigen so the immune system attacks the pathogen with the antigen, or by binding to interfere with pathogenic activity

	- a typical antibody is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains & two Ig light chains


## Processes

### carcinogenesis

### cell processes

	- apoptosis


### energy processes

	- ATP hydrolysis: releasing chemical energy in phosphoanhydride bonds of adenoside triphosphate (ATP) by splitting the phosphoanhydride bonds
		- produces adenosine diphosphate (ADP) & an inorganic phosphate (orthophosphate)
		- ADP produces energy, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and another orthophosphate
		- ATP hydrolysis is the last step in converting energy like food or sunlight into useful work like:
			- muscle contraction
			- establishing electrochemical gradient (solute & charge distribution across a membrane), usually for an ion's movement across a membrane

### DNA processes

	- genetic recombination: occurs in meiosis

	- somatic recombination: 

		- a somatic cell DNA change that is inherited by its daughter cells, usually in large-scale chromosomal translocations/deletions, not point mutations
		- relevant to the assembly of the B/T-cell receptor genes, the class-switching of immunoglobulins, & carcinogenesis
		- can target specific genes, like the gene for the amyloid precursor protein

	- variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombination: 

		- process that rearranges variable, joining & diversity gene segments
		- occurs only in developing lymphocytes during the early stages of T & B cell maturation
		- involves somatic recombination

		- produces a variety of: 
			- b cell antibodies/immunoglobulins
			- T cell receptors (TCRs)
		
		- final product is new amino acid sequences in antigen-binding regions of antibody proteins & t-cell receptors
		- these new amino acid sequences enable antibodies & t-cells to recognize antigens (from pathogens, cancerous cells, allergens & healthy host cells)
			- variable, joining, & diversity gene segment types influence variable sections of antibody proteins & t-cell receptors
		- when building lymphocytes, recombination occurs to generate new Variable/Diversity/Joining gene segments of the antibody's fragment antigen-binding region or the t-cell's receptor, so that new antibodies or t-cell receptors are generated which can handle new antigens

		- DNA rearrangement causes copies of each gene segment type (variable gene segment copy + diversity gene segment copy + joining gene segment copy) to go in any given lymphocyte, generating many possible antibodies 
		   	- there are around 3×10^11 combinations
		   	- some combinations are removed due to self reactivity, determined by testing in the thymus against host cell antigens, expressed using the autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE)

		- a t-cell's receptor is like an antibody's fragment antigen-binding region, both being part of the antibody superfamily
		- antibodies have heavy & light chains, whereas most t-cell receptors have alpha & beta chains
		- each chain has some of the gene segment regions (variable, joining, diversity, constant)
		- lymphocytes are tested against host antigens expressed by autoimmune regulatory protein (AIRE) in the thymus
		- lymphocytes that self-react are eliminated with apoptosis to prevent autoimmunity

		- occurs in lymphoid organs:
			- bone marrow for b cells
			- thymus for t cells

		- overall process:

			1. VDJ recombinase (RAG1 enzyme) binds a recombination signal sequence around a VDJ segment
			2. creates a nick on one strand of the DNA between the first base of the Recombination signal sequence just before the heptamer & the coding segment of the RSS
				- ATP hydrolysis (conversion into energy, ADP, AMP, or orthophosphates to enable work) is not necessary bc its energetically neutral
			3. a free 3' hydroxyl group and a 5' phosphate group is formed on the same strand
			4. the recombinase positions the hydroxyl group to attack the phosphodiester bond of the opposite strand
			5. two DNA ends are formed from this attack:
				- the hairpin stem-loop on the coding segment
				- a blunt end on the signal segment
			6. a recombination center executes the DNA nicking & hairpin formation simultaneously
			7. prior to ligation, the blunt signals ends are processed more, leading to junctional diversity (relationship type variation)
				- DNA-PK binds to each broken DNA end
				- recruits other proteins including artemis, xrcc4, dna ligase iv, cernunnos, & certain DNA polymerases
				- DNA-PK forms a complex, leading to its autophosphorylation
				- the autophosphorylation of DNA-PK activates artemis
				- artemis's activity opens the coding end hairpin segments
				- if the coding end hairpin segments are opened at the center, a blunt DNA end will result
				- usually its not at the center and one strand has extra bases
				- when DNA repair enzymes resolve the discrepancy in extra bases, the palindromic sequences produced are the reason why the corrected strand are called palindromic nucleotides
				- the Artemis hairpin opening process is crucial to VDJ recombination success
 				- XRCC4, cernunnos, and DNA-PK align the DNA ends and use terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme to add non-templated nucleotides to the coding end
				- exonucleases remove bases from the coding ends, including palidromic (P) or non-templated (N) nucleotides that may have formed
				- DNA polymerases lambda & mu then add nucleotides as needed to make the two ends compatible for joining
				- the process of 1, exonucleolytic removal of bases & P/N nucleotides & 2, adding nucleotides for compatibility, is possible but not enforced
				- the processed coding ends are ligated together using DNA ligase IV

			8. the blunt signal ends are flush-ligated together to form a signal joint (all the interim pieces between coding segments - a circle DNA segment of the intervening sequences between the coding segments)
				- signal joints may re-enter the genome and activate oncogenes or interrupting regulation gene function

			9. this process results in high variability in the antigen-binding region, even with the same gene segments as components, allowing new immunoglobulin antibodies or t-cell receptors to be generated even if the bio system hasnt encountered the corresponding pathogen antigens or a new version of an encountered pathogen before

			- this costly process can only work if the DNA remains in-frame (continuous segment) to maintain the right amino acid sequence in the final protein product - otherwise the cell development will stop & die - so this process has strict limits to succeed

		- components:

			- recombination signal sequences: protected sequences of noncoding DNA recognized by RAG1/2 enzymes during VDJ recombination in B/T cells

				- RSS components:
					- a heptamer of seven conserved nucleotides
					- a spacer region of 12/23 basepairs in length
					- a nonamer of 9 conserved nucleotides

				- Recombination signal sequences allow specific recombinations to be executed, by communicating position of VDJ gene segments
				- VDJ recombination enzymes recognize & bind to recombination signal sequences around the VDJ gene segments

				- RSS vary in sequence but have constant heptamer & nonamer sequences (heptamer: CACAGTG and nonamer: ACAAAAACC)
				- the sequence of the spacer region sequence is often lost
				- the length of the spacer region sequence is rarely lost
				- the spacer region length is usually about 1 or 2 turns of the DNA strand (1 turn = 12 basepairs, 2 turns = 23 basepairs)

				- 12/23 rule: gene segments to be recombined are usually adjacent to Recombination signal sequences of various spacer lengths (one has a "12 RSS" and one has a "23 RSS") 

					- to do: clarify which configuration this rule allows:
						12 RSS - V D J - 23 RSS
						12 RSS - V - 23 RSS
						V - 12 RSS - D J - 23 RSS

			- enzymes:
				- VDJ recombinase: a diverse collection of enzymes

				- DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)
				- X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4)
				- DNA ligase IV
				- non-homologous end-joining factor 1 (NHEJ1), aka Cernunnos, XRCC4-like factor [XLF], the Paralog of XRCC4 & XLF (PAXX)
				- DNA polymerases λ & μ

				- enzymes specific to lymphocytes (RAG, TdT)
					- recombination activating genes 1 & 2 (RAG)
					- terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT): a template-independent DNA polymerase that adds non-templated (N) nucleotides to the coding end during VDJ recombination, exhibiting a tendency to use G/C nucleotides, though the process of TdT adding nucleotides to the coding end is mostly random
						- like all DNA polymerases, Tdt adds nucleotides to a strand in a 5-3 direction

				- other enzymes found in other cell types or everywhere:
					- Artemis nuclease, a member of the ubiquitous non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for DNA repair


		- systems where recombination occurs:

			- antibody (specifically immunoglobulin):

				- composed of heavy & light chains
				- these chains contain constant (C) & variable (V) regions encoded on three antibody DNA loci (heavy, kappa, lambda)
				- fragment antibody binding (Fab) region: section of an antibody protein that is variable & binds to different antigens

				- heavy chain: large polypeptide subunit of the antibody 
					- defines the antibody isotype (constant gene segments)
					- humans have five heavy chain isotypes
				    - on antibody DNA's chromosome 14's heavy locus (IGH)
				   	- 2 Constant (Cμ & Cδ) gene segments
				   	- 44 Variable (V) gene segments
				   	- 27 Diversity (D) gene segments
				   	- 6 Joining (J) gene segments

				- light chain: small polypeptide subunit of the antibody 
			    	- on antibody DNA's chromosome 2's kappa locus (IGK) & chromosome 22's lambda (λ) locus (IGL)
				   	- 2 Constant (Cλ & Cκ) gene segments 
				   	- Variable & Joining gene segments
				   	- do not have D gene segments
				   	- has protein-coding genes that can be lost during rearrangement

			- t-cell receptors:

				- like antibody genes, most T cell receptor genes contain:
					- beta chains (V, D, & J gene segments)
					- alpha chains (V & J gene segments)

		- process order:

			- b-cell process

				- heavy chain

					1. delete DNA between a D & J gene segment (on chromosome 14's heavy chain locus)
					2. add a V gene segment from upstream the DJ combination
					3. delete DNA between V & D segments to form a VDJ segment
					4. generate primary transcript/unspliced RNA, containing the heavy chain VDJ region & both constant chains (V-D-J-Cμ-Cδ)
					5. remove sequence between VDJ & constant gene segments by adding a polyadenylated (poly-A) tail after the Cμ chain to the primary RNA
					6. translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the Ig M heavy chain protein

				- light chain

					- light chain kappa (κ) & lambda (λ) chains rearrange similarly, but light chains dont have a D segment
					1. first join V & J chains to give a VJ complex before adding the constant chain gene during primary transcription
					- translation of the spliced mRNA for either the kappa or lambda chains forms the Ig κ or Ig λ light chain protein

				- the mu Ig μ heavy chain + a light chain forms a membrane bound form of the IgM antibody type expressed on the surface of the immature B cell

			- t-cell (thymocyte) receptors process

				- the T cell receptor (TCR) chains undergo a similar recombination process as for antibodies

					1. first the D-to-J recombination occurs in the TCR beta chain
						- this process can involve either:
							- joining the Dβ1 gene segment to one of six Jβ1 segments
							- joining the Dβ2 gene segment to one of six Jβ2 segments

					2. DJ recombination is followed with Vβ-to-DβJβ rearrangements
					3. all gene segments between the Vβ-Dβ-Jβ gene segments in the newly formed complex are deleted 
					4. the primary transcript is synthesized, incorporating the constant domain gene (Vβ-Dβ-Jβ-Cβ)
					5. mRNA transcription splices out any intervening sequence, allowing translation of the full length protein for the TCR beta chain

				- the rearrangement of the alpha (α) chain of the TCR follows β chain rearrangement, & resembles Ig light chain V-to-J rearrangement
				- the assembly of the beta & alpha chains results in formation of the alpha-beta-TCR that is expressed on a majority of T cells
