## Pathways

- ampk

- wint


## Systems
	
	- dna system

		- concepts:
			- signal joint: when blunt signal ends are flush ligated together to form a circular piece of DNA containing all of the intervening sequences between the coding segments known as a signal joint 

	- lymph
		- a system composed of lymph vessels (channels) and intervening lymph nodes whose function, like the venous system, is to return fluid from the tissues to the central circulation

	- immune

		- sub-systems:
			- innate
			- adaptive

		- concepts:
			- autoimmunity: immune system attacking healthy cells/the host
			- allergen
			- memory cell∆í

		- components:
			- thymus: a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system where T cells mature
				- converts to adipose tissue in adolescence/adulthood

	- circulatory

	- nervous

	- digestive
	

## Organisms

### Pathogens

#### virus

#### bacteria

#### fungus

#### parasites


## Interfaces

### Structure

#### Limits

	- boundaries:

		- cortex: outermost layer of an organ

			- kidneys, brain, lymph, adrenal glands, thymus have well-defined cortices

#### Layers

	- organ

		- cortex: outermost layer of an organ


## Components

- protein:

- enzyme:

	- transferase
	- polymerase
	- protease
	- amylase

- receptor:

- DNA:

- amino acid:

- electrolyte:

- blood plasma: the fluid component of blood

- interstitial fluid: the fluid between all body tissue cells 

- lymph fluid: fluid derived from interstitial fluid that flows through the lymphatic system

	- interstitial fluid enters the lymph capillaries
		- then this lymph fluid is transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes
			- where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes & circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid
				- before emptying ultimately into the right/left subclavian vein
					- where it mixes with central venous blood

	- its composition changes as blood & surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid
	- similar to blood plasma
	- lymph returns proteins & extra interstitial fluid to the bloodstream
	- lymph also transports fats from the digestive system (from the lacteals) to the blood via chylomicrons
	- bacteria may enter the lymph channels and be transported to lymph nodes, where they are destroyed
	- metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph


## Cell Types

- lymphocyte: white blood cell type with a large nucleus including nk & t & b cells, the main cell type in lymph fluid
	 - natural killer (nk) cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity)
	 - T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity)
	 - B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity)

- t-cell:

- b-cell:

- plasma:

- memory cell:

- antigen: any molecule or linear molecular fragment that can be identified by a t-cell receptor

- macrophage: white blood cell type

- antibody (immunoglobulin): 

	- y-shaped protein produced by plasma cells that neutralizes pathogens, either by binding to tag an antigen so the immune system attacks the pathogen with the antigen, or by binding to interfere with pathogenic activity

	- a typical antibody is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains & two Ig light chains


## Processes

### carcinogenesis

### cell processes

	- apoptosis


### energy processes

	- ATP hydrolysis: releasing chemical energy in phosphoanhydride bonds of adenoside triphosphate (ATP) by splitting the phosphoanhydride bonds
		- produces adenosine diphosphate (ADP) & an inorganic phosphate (orthophosphate)
		- ADP produces energy, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and another orthophosphate
		- ATP hydrolysis is the last step in converting energy like food or sunlight into useful work like:
			- muscle contraction
			- establishing electrochemical gradient (solute & charge distribution across a membrane), usually for an ion's movement across a membrane

### DNA processes

	- genetic recombination: occurs in meiosis

	- somatic recombination: 

		- a somatic cell DNA change that is inherited by its daughter cells, usually in large-scale chromosomal translocations/deletions, not point mutations
		- relevant to the assembly of the B/T-cell receptor genes, the class-switching of immunoglobulins, & carcinogenesis
		- can target specific genes, like the gene for the amyloid precursor protein

	- variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombination: 

		- process that rearranges variable, joining & diversity gene segments
		- occurs only in developing lymphocytes during the early stages of T & B cell maturation
		- involves somatic recombination

		- produces a variety of: 
			- b cell antibodies/immunoglobulins
			- T cell receptors (TCRs)
