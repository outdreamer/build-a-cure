# Bio Terms

## Components

protein:

enzyme:

	- transferase
	- polymerase
	- protease
	- amylase
	- 

receptor:

DNA:

amino acid:

electrolyte:

blood plasma: the fluid component of blood

interstitial fluid: the fluid between all body tissue cells 

lymph fluid: fluid derived from interstitial fluid that flows through the lymphatic system

	- interstitial fluid enters the lymph capillaries
		- then this lymph fluid is transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes
			- where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes & circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid
				- before emptying ultimately into the right/left subclavian vein
					- where it mixes with central venous blood

	- its composition changes as blood & surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid
	- similar to blood plasma
	- lymph returns proteins & extra interstitial fluid to the bloodstream
	- lymph also transports fats from the digestive system (from the lacteals) to the blood via chylomicrons
	- bacteria may enter the lymph channels and be transported to lymph nodes, where they are destroyed
	- metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph


## Cell Types

lymphocyte: white blood cell type with a large nucleus including nk & t & b cells, the main cell type in lymph fluid
	 - natural killer (nk) cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity)
	 - T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity)
	 - B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity)

t-cell:

b-cell:

plasma:

memory cell:

antigen: any molecule or linear molecular fragment that can be identified by a t-cell receptor

antibody (immunoglobulin): 

	- y-shaped protein produced by plasma cells that neutralizes pathogens, either by binding to tag an antigen so the immune system attacks the pathogen with the antigen, or by binding to interfere with pathogenic activity

macrophage: white blood cell type

## Processes

- carcinogenesis

- cell processes:
	- apoptosis

- DNA processes:

	- genetic recombination: occurs in meiosis

	- somatic recombination: 

		- a somatic cell DNA change that is inherited by its daughter cells, usually in large-scale chromosomal translocations/deletions, not point mutations
		- relevant to the assembly of the B/T-cell receptor genes, the class-switching of immunoglobulins, & carcinogenesis
		- can target specific genes, like the gene for the amyloid precursor protein

	- variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombination: 

		- unique mechanism of genetic recombination, that occurs only in developing lymphocytes during the early stages of T and B cell maturation
		- involves somatic recombination
		- produces a variety of: 
			- antibodies/immunoglobulins of B cells
			- T cell receptors (TCRs) of T cells
		- final product is new amino acid sequences in antigen-binding regions of antibody proteins & t-cell receptors
		- these new amino acid sequences enable antibodies & t-cells to recognize antigens (from pathogens, cancerous cells, allergens & healthy host cells)

		- occurs in lymphoid organs:
			- bone marrow for b cells
			- thymus for t cells

		- rearranges variable, joining & diversity gene segments

		- components:

			- t-cell receptors: 
				- most T-cell receptors are composed of an alpha & a beta chain

			- recominant signal sequences: 

		- process:

	- variable, joining, & diversity gene segment types influence variable sections of antibody proteins & t-cell receptors
	- when building lymphocytes, recombination occurs to generate new Variable/Diversity/Joining gene segments of the antibody's fragment antigen-binding region or the t-cell's receptor, so that new antibodies or t-cell receptors are generated which can handle new antigens

	- DNA rearrangement causes a copy of each gene segment type (variable gene segment copy + diversity gene segment copy + joining gene segment copy) to go in any given lymphocyte, generating many possible antibodies 
	   	- there are around 3×10^11 combinations
	   	- some combinations are removed due to self reactivity as determined by testing in the thymus against host cell antigens, expressed using the autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE)

	- a t-cell's receptor is like an antibody's fragment antigen-binding region, both being part of the antibody superfamily

	- antibodies have heavy & light chains, whereas most t-cell receptors have alpha & beta chains
	- each chain has some of the gene segment regions (variable, joining, diversity, constant)

	- antibody (specifically immunoglobulin):

		- composed of heavy & light chains
		- these chains contain constant (C) & variable (V) regions encoded on three antibody DNA loci (heavy, kappa, lambda)
		
		- fragment antibody binding (Fab) region: section of an antibody protein that is variable & binds to different antigens
		
		- light chain: small polypeptide subunit of the antibody 

		- heavy chain: large polypeptide subunit of the antibody 
			- defines the antibody isotype (constant gene segments)
			- humans have five heavy chain isotypes

		- heavy chain gene segments:
		    - on antibody DNA's chromosome 14's heavy locus (IGH)
		   	- 2 Constant (Cμ & Cδ) gene segments
		   	- 44 Variable (V) gene segments
		   	- 27 Diversity (D) gene segments
		   	- 6 Joining (J) gene segments

		- light chain gene segments:
	    	- on antibody DNA's chromosome 2's kappa locus (IGK) & chromosome 22's lambda (λ) locus (IGL)
		   	- 2 Constant (Cλ & Cκ) gene segments 
		   	- Variable & Joining gene segments
		   	- do not have D gene segments
		   	- has protein-coding genes that can be lost during rearrangement

	- t-cell receptors:

		- most T-cell receptors have alpha & beta chains
		- like antibody genes, T cell receptor genes contain:
			- beta chains (V, D, & J gene segments)
			- alpha chains (V & J gene segments)

	- lymphocytes are tested against host antigens expressed by autoimmune regulatory protein (AIRE) in the thymus
	- lymphocytes that self-react are eliminated with apoptosis to prevent autoimmunity

## Systems

### Organ systems

	- lymph
		- a system composed of lymph vessels (channels) and intervening lymph nodes whose function, like the venous system, is to return fluid from the tissues to the central circulation

	- immune

		- sub-systems:
			- innate
			- adaptive

		- concepts:
			- autoimmunity: immune system attacking healthy cells/the host
			- allergen
			- memory cellƒ

		- components:
			- thymus: a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system where T cells mature
				- converts to adipose tissue in adolescence/adulthood

	- nervous

	- digestive

### Sub-Systems
	
	- dna system

		- concepts:
			- signal joint: when blunt signal ends are flush ligated together to form a circular piece of DNA containing all of the intervening sequences between the coding segments known as a signal joint 


## Interfaces

### Structure

#### Limits

	- boundaries:

		- cortex: outermost layer of an organ

			- kidneys, brain, lymph, adrenal glands, thymus have well-defined cortices
