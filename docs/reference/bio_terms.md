## Components

- protein:

- enzyme:

	- transferase
	- polymerase
	- protease
	- amylase

- receptor:

- DNA:

- amino acid:

- electrolyte:

- blood plasma: the fluid component of blood

- interstitial fluid: the fluid between all body tissue cells 

- lymph fluid: fluid derived from interstitial fluid that flows through the lymphatic system

	- interstitial fluid enters the lymph capillaries
		- then this lymph fluid is transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes
			- where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes & circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid
				- before emptying ultimately into the right/left subclavian vein
					- where it mixes with central venous blood

	- its composition changes as blood & surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid
	- similar to blood plasma
	- lymph returns proteins & extra interstitial fluid to the bloodstream
	- lymph also transports fats from the digestive system (from the lacteals) to the blood via chylomicrons
	- bacteria may enter the lymph channels and be transported to lymph nodes, where they are destroyed
	- metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph


## Cell Types

- lymphocyte: white blood cell type with a large nucleus including nk & t & b cells, the main cell type in lymph fluid
	 - natural killer (nk) cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity)
	 - T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity)
	 - B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity)

- t-cell:

- b-cell:

- plasma:

- memory cell:

- antigen: any molecule or linear molecular fragment that can be identified by a t-cell receptor

- macrophage: white blood cell type

- antibody (immunoglobulin): 

	- y-shaped protein produced by plasma cells that neutralizes pathogens, either by binding to tag an antigen so the immune system attacks the pathogen with the antigen, or by binding to interfere with pathogenic activity

	- a typical antibody is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains & two Ig light chains


## Processes

### carcinogenesis

### cell processes

	- apoptosis

### DNA processes

	- genetic recombination: occurs in meiosis

	- somatic recombination: 

		- a somatic cell DNA change that is inherited by its daughter cells, usually in large-scale chromosomal translocations/deletions, not point mutations
		- relevant to the assembly of the B/T-cell receptor genes, the class-switching of immunoglobulins, & carcinogenesis
		- can target specific genes, like the gene for the amyloid precursor protein

	- variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombination: 

		- process that rearranges variable, joining & diversity gene segments
		- occurs only in developing lymphocytes during the early stages of T & B cell maturation
		- involves somatic recombination

		- produces a variety of: 
			- b cell antibodies/immunoglobulins
			- T cell receptors (TCRs)
		
		- final product is new amino acid sequences in antigen-binding regions of antibody proteins & t-cell receptors
		
		- these new amino acid sequences enable antibodies & t-cells to recognize antigens (from pathogens, cancerous cells, allergens & healthy host cells)
		
			- variable, joining, & diversity gene segment types influence variable sections of antibody proteins & t-cell receptors
		- when building lymphocytes, recombination occurs to generate new Variable/Diversity/Joining gene segments of the antibody's fragment antigen-binding region or the t-cell's receptor, so that new antibodies or t-cell receptors are generated which can handle new antigens

		- DNA rearrangement causes copies of each gene segment type (variable gene segment copy + diversity gene segment copy + joining gene segment copy) to go in any given lymphocyte, generating many possible antibodies 
		   	- there are around 3×10^11 combinations
		   	- some combinations are removed due to self reactivity, determined by testing in the thymus against host cell antigens, expressed using the autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE)

		- a t-cell's receptor is like an antibody's fragment antigen-binding region, both being part of the antibody superfamily
		- antibodies have heavy & light chains, whereas most t-cell receptors have alpha & beta chains
		- each chain has some of the gene segment regions (variable, joining, diversity, constant)
		- lymphocytes are tested against host antigens expressed by autoimmune regulatory protein (AIRE) in the thymus
		- lymphocytes that self-react are eliminated with apoptosis to prevent autoimmunity

		- occurs in lymphoid organs:
			- bone marrow for b cells
			- thymus for t cells

		- components:

			- recombinant signal sequences: 

		- systems where recombination occurs:

			- antibody (specifically immunoglobulin):

				- composed of heavy & light chains
				- these chains contain constant (C) & variable (V) regions encoded on three antibody DNA loci (heavy, kappa, lambda)
				- fragment antibody binding (Fab) region: section of an antibody protein that is variable & binds to different antigens

				- heavy chain: large polypeptide subunit of the antibody 
					- defines the antibody isotype (constant gene segments)
					- humans have five heavy chain isotypes
				    - on antibody DNA's chromosome 14's heavy locus (IGH)
				   	- 2 Constant (Cμ & Cδ) gene segments
				   	- 44 Variable (V) gene segments
				   	- 27 Diversity (D) gene segments
				   	- 6 Joining (J) gene segments

				- light chain: small polypeptide subunit of the antibody 
			    	- on antibody DNA's chromosome 2's kappa locus (IGK) & chromosome 22's lambda (λ) locus (IGL)
				   	- 2 Constant (Cλ & Cκ) gene segments 
				   	- Variable & Joining gene segments
				   	- do not have D gene segments
				   	- has protein-coding genes that can be lost during rearrangement

			- t-cell receptors:

				- like antibody genes, most T cell receptor genes contain:
					- beta chains (V, D, & J gene segments)
					- alpha chains (V & J gene segments)

		- process order:

			- b-cell process

				- heavy chain

					1. delete DNA between a D & J gene segment (on chromosome 14's heavy chain locus)
					2. add a V gene segment from upstream the DJ combination
					3. delete DNA between V & D segments to form a VDJ segment
					4. generate primary transcript/unspliced RNA, containing the heavy chain VDJ region & both constant chains (V-D-J-Cμ-Cδ)
					5. remove sequence between VDJ & constant gene segments by adding a polyadenylated (poly-A) tail after the Cμ chain to the primary RNA
					6. translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the Ig M heavy chain protein

				- light chain

					- light chain kappa (κ) & lambda (λ) chains rearrange similarly, but light chains dont have a D segment
					1. first join V & J chains to give a VJ complex before adding the constant chain gene during primary transcription
					- translation of the spliced mRNA for either the kappa or lambda chains forms the Ig κ or Ig λ light chain protein

				- the mu Ig μ heavy chain + a light chain forms a membrane bound form of the IgM antibody type expressed on the surface of the immature B cell

			- t-cell (thymocyte) receptors process

				- the T cell receptor (TCR) chains undergo a similar recombination process as for antibodies

					1. first the D-to-J recombination occurs in the TCR beta chain
						- this process can involve either:
							- joining the Dβ1 gene segment to one of six Jβ1 segments
							- joining the Dβ2 gene segment to one of six Jβ2 segments

					2. DJ recombination is followed with Vβ-to-DβJβ rearrangements
					3. all gene segments between the Vβ-Dβ-Jβ gene segments in the newly formed complex are deleted 
					4. the primary transcript is synthesized, incorporating the constant domain gene (Vβ-Dβ-Jβ-Cβ)
					5. mRNA transcription splices out any intervening sequence, allowing translation of the full length protein for the TCR beta chain

				- the rearrangement of the alpha (α) chain of the TCR follows β chain rearrangement, & resembles Ig light chain V-to-J rearrangement
				- the assembly of the beta & alpha chains results in formation of the alpha-beta-TCR that is expressed on a majority of T cells
