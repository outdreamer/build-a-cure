## Organisms

### Pathogens

#### virus

- Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or dead viruses, or viral proteins (antigens)
- Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus (live-attenuated viruses), which dont cause the disease but still confer immunity
- Subunit vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus

- Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues (fake DNA building-blocks), which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication
- The life-cycle of the virus is halted because the newly synthesised DNA is inactive, because analogues lack the hydroxyl groups, which, along with phosphorus atoms, link together to form the structure of the DNA molecule (DNA chain termination), so the linking can't continue


#### bacteria

#### fungus

#### parasites


## Components

### molecule objects

	- chiral: if a molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by any number of transformations or rotations
	- stereocenter: a particular instance of a stereogenic element that is any point in a molecule (can be an atom) having different subcomponents, so interchanging any two subcomponents leads to a stereoisomer
	- stereoisomer: molecule with different orientations but the same formula & sequence
		- enantiomer: one of two stereoisomers (differently oriented versions) that are mirror images (almost identical object reflected about a perpendicular symmetry) of each other that are non-superposable (not identical)
			- rotating a right hand will not produce a left hand bc of finger order transformation (thumb is on opposite side)
			- the orientation of the finger order is opposite, even though the hand itself is generated similarly
			- so because the finger sub-system order attribute was already superimposed on its mirror image (reversed), the whole system of the hand cannot be superimposed on its mirror image with perfect alignment
			- the rotation about the finger order symmetry on the finger interface invalides some alignments across symmetries applied to the platform hand interface
			- this is a good example of an identification attribute emerging from an interface/symmetry stack and a transformation set

	- chirality center: a stereocenter consisting of an atom holding a set of ligands (atoms or atom sets) in an arrangement which is not superimposable on its mirror image
		- example: asymmetric carbon atom (a carbon atom bonded to four different entities) such that interchanging any two groups creates an enantiomer
		- chiral center with definition substitution: 
			- a molecule/component having different subcomponents, so interchanging any two subcomponents leads to a stereoisomer (differently oriented version), consisting of an atom with an atom set arranged so it can be superimposed on its mirror image
			- like an interface or point for change in orientation of subcomponents


### macromolecules

	- acid
	- ester: a chemical compound derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one OH hydroxyl group is replaced by an Oâ€“alkyl alkoxy group
	- monomer: unit of polymer 
	- oligomer
	- polymer: macromolecule created by many repeated units
		- peptide: amino acid chain linked by peptide bonds 
		- oligosaccharide
		- polysaccharide
		- nucleic acid:
			- term used to refer to the set of DNA & RNA (ribonucleic acid & deoxyribonucleic acid)
			- small biopolymers composed of nucleotides
			- nucleotide: 

				- the components of the nucleotide are unit blocks, two of which are highly stable, two of which are core structure (phosphate & sugar) with core distortions (orientation, form (linear/cycle state), & attachable groups, solvent in core system context like water) that are useful to build other structures, and one of which is a unit bond (nitrogenous base)

				- monomer made from:
					- a 5-carbon sugar (pentose)
						- stability source:
							- in the cell, pentoses have a higher metabolic stability than hexoses
						- processes:
							- Phosphorylated pentoses are important products of the pentose phosphate pathway, most importantly ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), which is used in the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids, and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), which is used in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids
						
						- types:
							- if the sugar is a compound ribose, the polymer is RNA
							- if the sugar is derived from ribose (deoxyribose), the polymer is DNA
							- deoxyribose is created from ribose by the replacement of one/multiple hydroxyl groups with hydrogen

						- states:
							- open-chain/linear: usually only in solvents, easily converted to two versions of a closed-chain pentose & back
							- closed-chain/cyclic: formed when the carbonyl group interacts with a hydroxyl in another carbon, 
								turning the carbonyl into a hydroxyl & connecting the two carbons with an ether bridge containing an interim oxygen
								so the carboxyl carbon becomes a chiral center with two possible orientations depending on the new hydroxyl position

					- a phosphate group: an anion, salt, functional group or ester derived from a phosphoric acid, most commonly referring to orthophosphate

						- orthophosphate: a derivative of orthophosphoric acid by removing three protons, so that other organic groups can be attached in place of the hydrogen

						- many phosphates are not soluble in water at standard temperature and pressure, but the sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and ammonium phosphates are all water-soluble, and hydrogen/dihydrogen phosphates are slightly soluble

						- tetrahedron form, similar to planar form of nitrogenous base but with another dimension and slight angle applied - useful as a hub

					- a nitrogenous base: an organic molecule with a nitrogen atom with the chemical properties of a base, whose nitrogen's electron pair binds the other nucleic acid components
						- usually derivatives of two parent compounds, pyrimidine & purine
						- flat shape
						- planar (one central molecule with multiple bonds all in one plane) due to their aromaticity (property leading to high stability)
							- supports change in multiple directions restricted to two dimensions
							- useful in combination operations
						- stability source:
							- non-polar
							- both pyrimidines & purines resemble pyridine, are thus weak bases, relatively unreactive to electrophilic aromatic substitution

	- protein:

		- types

			- amino acid
			- cytokines: small proteins important in cell signaling, used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system
				- interferons: proteins released to signal presence of viruses
					- interferons activate immune cells (nk cells & macrophages)
					- increase host defenses by up-regulating (increasing gene expression for) antigen presentation, by increasing expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens


	- enzyme:
		- transferase
		- polymerase
		- protease
		- amylase

### DNA

	- topologically associated domains
	- major histocompatibility complex (MHC): large DNA region coding for cell surface proteins (essential to the adaptive immune system), specific to vertebrates
		- closely linked polymorphic gene set 
		- cell surface MHC molecules display a small peptide (a molecular fraction of a protein called an epitope)
	- DNA
	- RNA

### cell components

	- receptor
	- nucleus:
	- mitochondria
	- surface
	- membrance
	- fluid/pressure

- electrolyte:

- blood plasma: the fluid component of blood

- interstitial fluid: the fluid between all body tissue cells 

- lymph fluid: fluid derived from interstitial fluid that flows through the lymphatic system

	- interstitial fluid enters the lymph capillaries
		- then this lymph fluid is transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes
			- where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes & circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid
				- before emptying ultimately into the right/left subclavian vein
					- where it mixes with central venous blood

	- its composition changes as blood & surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid
	- similar to blood plasma
	- lymph returns proteins & extra interstitial fluid to the bloodstream
	- lymph also transports fats from the digestive system (from the lacteals) to the blood via chylomicrons
	- bacteria may enter the lymph channels and be transported to lymph nodes, where they are destroyed
	- metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph


## Cell Types

- lymphocyte: white blood cell type with a large nucleus including nk & t & b cells, the main cell type in lymph fluid
	 - natural killer (nk) cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity)
	 - T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity)
	 - B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity)

- blast cell:
	- stem cell transformed into a partially differentiated cell

- t-cell: a type of lymphocyte that develops in the thymus
	- t-cells start out as precursor/blast cells from bone marrow
	- the t-cell receptor is on the cell surface
	- t-cells differentiate even after leaving the thymus

- b-cell: a white blood cell type of the lymphocyte subtype
	- b-cells are antigen-presenting cells
	- b-cells secrete cytokines
	- b-cells mature in the bone marrow in mammals
	- b-cells express receptors on their membrane, unlike NK cells or t-cells

- plasma:

- memory cell:

- antigen: any molecule or linear molecular fragment that can be identified by a t-cell receptor

	- epitope: part of the antigen that is recognized/binded to by antibody
		- a linear epitope: a amino acid sequence or structure recognizable by an antibody
		- a conformational epitode: a 3-d amino acid structure or associated protein structure recognizable by an antibody

- macrophage: white blood cell type

- antibody (immunoglobulin): 

	- y-shaped protein produced by plasma cells that neutralizes pathogens, either by binding to tag an antigen so the immune system attacks the pathogen with the antigen, or by binding to interfere with pathogenic activity

	- a typical antibody is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains & two Ig light chains

	- paratope: the part of the antibody that binds to the antigen


## Processes

### carcinogenesis

### cell processes

	- apoptosis

### energy processes

	- ATP hydrolysis: releasing chemical energy in phosphoanhydride bonds of adenoside triphosphate (ATP) by splitting the phosphoanhydride bonds
		- produces adenosine diphosphate (ADP) & an inorganic phosphate (orthophosphate)
		- ADP produces energy, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and another orthophosphate
		- ATP hydrolysis is the last step in converting energy like food or sunlight into useful work like:
			- muscle contraction
			- establishing electrochemical gradient (solute & charge distribution across a membrane), usually for an ion's movement across a membrane

### DNA processes

	- genetic recombination: occurs in meiosis

	- somatic recombination: 

		- a somatic cell DNA change that is inherited by its daughter cells, usually in large-scale chromosomal translocations/deletions, not point mutations
		- relevant to the assembly of the B/T-cell receptor genes, the class-switching of immunoglobulins, & carcinogenesis
		- can target specific genes, like the gene for the amyloid precursor protein

	- variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombination: 

		- process that rearranges variable, joining & diversity gene segments
		- occurs only in developing lymphocytes during the early stages of T & B cell maturation
		- involves somatic recombination
		- produces a variety of: 
			- b cell antibodies/immunoglobulins
			- T cell receptors (TCRs)
