  - multiple servers/processors in one computer with one-way data transfers, so one server can be for local communication, one can be for offline work, one can be for browsing internet, and local/offline can communicate to internet-browing processor but not the other way around

  - rules-to-code translation tool - translating domain-specific plain language rules to robot code can be short-term useful for automation of service industry tasks like:
    - converting recipes/flavor-mixing strategies to cooking robot code (chefs can use a tool like this to make money short-term or sell their rules, if they have unique strategies)
    - converting new plant designs to genome editing code
    - converting local social insights to global code (avoid personalities like this, use these tactics to persuade, make this argument to get them to an insight position, etc)
    - converting adaptation insights to change-attracting system adaptation code
    - converting routing mechanisms/optimizations to drone code (short-term human insights like 'avoiding a particular street bc of construction' that data isnt adequate for)
    - the general task of converting rule sets (systems) or human-made visuals (graphs, blueprints) to code

    - machine learning can be used for initial conversion, then tweaked with coded filters like priorities, logic, organization, output
    - system analysis can be used to optimize beyond those standard filters
    - this needs to identify existing rules (or specific versions of abstract rules, distorted versions of standard rules) & filter them out
    - this is an alternative & and an interim step to raw code-generation given a set of intents

  - data viz can be automated using:
    - lie core function layer graph or individual lie type graphs, with an output intent layer (hide information, layer information, minimize information, obfuscate information)
    - intent-structure maps (this graph structure serves this intent stack, just like a function serves an intent stack)

  - each superposition contains components representing different possible filters for the physical laws they create at scale
    - some superpositions collapse into a particular attribute set
    - superpositions with different configurations may represent other interface queries or structures
    - knowing the internal structure of a superposition would mean we get to choose which queries come to life & become real
    - the design implies we shouldnt get to choose - but external forces (or unmeasurable/uncomputable forces inside the universe) should get to determine which configurations collapse & which differences are allowed
    - information has a lifecycle - its likelier to become more true the more its observed, up to a maximum - then it's likelier to erode as its depended on
    - observing a state (to produce the information of the observation) may initialize the static nature of that information, so other observers see either static information or lack of it depending on their perspective, as information becomes truer the more its observed, and they may focus on the lack of information or a different perspective than the initial state of the information

  - make AI models/graph databases of theoretical physicists opinions so I can suggest these concepts to them

  - search ideas:
      - inferring useful search filters based on customer usage history & intent
        - linked searches/user data with type/intent identification - if they are in a location with a certain pathogen and they search for cleaners, theyre probably trying to clean that pathogen so cleaners should be specific or at least an optional search results set should be linked to
      - automated attribute extraction/addition to search as a filter
      - search results as graphs: variables entered in search to display relationships found in data or graph images or graphetized articles
      - processed (aggregated) results - find the average/combined or plain language definition when searching for a definition
      - predicting what questions theyll ask next and adding those search results (or a summary) on the side
      - intent-based search guidance:
        - usually people who search for an answer are studying for a test, so additional widgets like suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'study guides', 'summaries', 'tutorials'
        - people searching for recipes are hosting a party & cooking other things, so suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'flavor graphs'
        - people searching for symptoms are trying to diagnose themselves or someone else, so suggested content could include links to diagnostic tools or graphs of symptom set frequency for conditions

  - shared custom meaning/dictionary maps so communication can be queries on their shared custom dictionary map - or a common map where queries specify pattern & sub-set to apply pattern to, and sub-sets are rotated
