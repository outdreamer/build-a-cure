If they are or if any of them shall be under the age of eighteen (18) years, then it shall be held in trust until such time as s/he becomes of age.

If there should be no living beneficiary under the above provisions to receive the assets in my residuary estate, then my residuary estate shall be distributed to the persons who would be entitled thereto under the laws of descent and distribution pursuant to the laws of the State of California, as if I had died intestate at that time owning such property in fee simple, with exclusion of those descendants which may be listed in the attached Disinherit Schedule as disinherited, if any.

TESTAMENTARY TRUST
Any property, assets or other distributions from my estate intended for a beneficiary under18 years of age at the time of distribution is to be made, shall not be paid or distributed outright to such beneficiary, but rather shall be held in trust by my Trustee, or if I have not named a Trustee, by my Executor in the capacity of a Trustee, upon the following terms and conditions.
The Trustee shall hold, manage, invest and reinvest the property of such beneficiary in a separate trust and shall distribute to or for the benefit of the beneficiary so much or all of the net income or principal thereof as the Trustee, in the Trustee's sole discretion, shall deem necessary to provide for such beneficiary's health, education, maintenance and support, taking into consideration any other resources available to such beneficiary. Any net income not so paid shall be accumulated and added to principal at least annually and thereafter shall be held, administered and disposed of as a part thereof.

When such beneficiary reaches years of age, the Trustee shall distribute of the assets then held in trust to such beneficiary; and if and when such beneficiary reaches years of age, the Trust shall automatically terminate and the Trustee shall distribute all remaining principal and income to such beneficiary. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, my Trustee may determine it is in the best interests of the beneficiary to terminate the trust prior to such beneficiary reaching years of age and distribute all trust assets directly to such beneficiary or into a custodial account established for such beneficiary, and my Trustee shall have no liability therefore.

If such beneficiary dies prior to receiving all of the assets in his/her trust, the principal and income in such beneficiary's trust shall be paid and distributed to such beneficiary's living Descendants, if any; and if none, then to my living Descendants, provided, however, that if any such Descendant is a beneficiary of another trust under this Will, such property otherwise distributable to such beneficiary shall be held in accordance with such trust. If I have no living Descendants, such property shall be distributed to the beneficiaries of my residuary estate as provided in this Will, or if there are none, to the persons who would be entitled thereto under the laws of descent and distribution of the State of California if I had died intestate at that time owning such property in fee simple.

AVOIDANCE OF CONSERVATORSHIP
If any property of my estate vests in absolute ownership in a minor or incompetent, my Executor, at any time and without court authorization, may:
a) distribute the whole or any part of such property to the beneficiary;
b) hold such property in trust and use the whole or any part for the health, education, maintenance and support of the beneficiary;
c) distribute the whole or any part to a guardian, conservator, committee or other legal representative of the beneficiary;
d) distribute the whole or part to a custodian for the beneficiary under any gifts or transfers to minors act; or
e) distribute the whole or part to the person or persons with whom the beneficiary resides.

Evidence of any such distribution or the receipt therefor executed by the person to whom the distribution is made shall be a full discharge of my Executor from any liability with respect thereto, even though my Executor may be such person.
If such beneficiary dies before receiving all of the assets held in conservancy, the principal and income in such beneficiary's trust shall be paid and distributed to such beneficiary's living Descendants, if any; and if none, then to my living Descendants. If I have no living Descendants, such property shall be distributed to the beneficiaries of my residuary estate, as provided in this Will, or if there none, to the persons who would be entitled thereto under the laws of descent and distribution of the State of California as if I had died intestate at that time owning such property in fee simple.

SPENDTHRIFT PROVISION
 
The interest of any beneficiary of any trust created under this Will shall not be transferred, assigned or conveyed, and shall not be subject to the claims of any creditors of such beneficiary, or of any local, state or federal government or agency, or of any private agencies, and the Trustee, or if I have not named a Trustee, by my Executor in the capacity of a Trustee, shall continue distributing trust property directly to or for the benefit of such beneficiary as provided for herein, notwithstanding any transfer, assignment, conveyance or action by creditors governments or agencies. If the Trustee is prevented by any transfer, assignment or conveyance or by any proceeding brought by any creditor, government or agency or by any bankruptcy, receivership or other proceeding, from distributing property directly to or for the benefit of any beneficiary, the Trustee shall hold and accumulate the property which would otherwise have been distributed until the Trustee is able to distribute such property directly to or for the benefit of such beneficiary, or until the death of such beneficiary, whichever first occurs; and on the death of such beneficiary any such property so held and accumulated shall become a part of the principal of the trust and shall be disposed of accordingly.
