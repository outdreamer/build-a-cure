  - map core concepts to structures for use when building other concepts/objects

    - similar definition structures apply to similarly abstract concepts

    - change types (rule types like binding rules, boundary rules) can be used to generate different variations of a concept
      - power can be in the form of a connection hub (binding rules with an extreme value of the connection count attribute)

    - position is an important attribute in many abstract concepts (powerful position, power occupying the input position, position as an attribute of equivalence)
      - other core structural attributes can be used to generate the other concepts

    - concept definitions are useful so you can answer questions like:
      - is this system balanced/robust to change/have distributed power
      - what potential does this system have
      - what priorities does this system have
      - can this system impact many others (is it powerful)
      - does this system produce a conceptual attribute/object like trust/equality
      - what concepts (determining, generative, emergent, prioritized, optimized) do these systems have in common
