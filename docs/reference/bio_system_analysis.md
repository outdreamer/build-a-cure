# Bio system analysis


## Key Questions

    - iterative analysis: 
      - analysis that treats cyclical, recursive, cascading & iterative processes as trade loops between positions & systems
      - example: in addition to analyzing how a drug is metabolized:
        - how its structure will interact with other structures
        - how the resulting structures after the nth-interaction will interact with other resulting structures, etc
        - how the dna of a probiotic or other microorganism treatment could get re-purposed by microorganisms
        - how the activity of a gene could get accidentally impacted in other pathways & which of those pathways are possible given a treatment
        - how an interaction can be minimally modified to produce extremely different results
        - how nth-iteration interactions will be timed with other processes cycling in that time
        - how causal cascades can cycle to be interactive with the treatment
        - how functionality gaps or interactions at nth-iteration can provide opportunities for mutation & other randomness sources 

    - given the known vulnerabilities of the bio-system:
      - which problems are solvable (killing pathogen, deploying a substance to a position) with what methods (evolution, medicine, stressor distribution)
      - which problems are inevitable
      - which problems are solvable with auto-generated vs. external resources
      - which stressor patterns can prevent which problems

    - reduce uncertainty in these questions (rule gaps, possible efficiencies, state changes)

		- optimization questions
				- what small/large swaps are optimal for attaching single-chain variable fragments
				- what structure of the boundary is needed
				- what sources of single-chain variable fragments are available
				- is the short linker peptide required to bind the single-chain variable fragments to the heavy/light chain variable segments, or are there other available resources to bind them?

				- bounded system:
					- can single-chain variable fragments be generated in a second region limited by a boundary, then merged with the heterodimeric bounded region when the heterodimeric bounded region is ready for single-chain variable fragments
					- can you place both of these bounded regions in another system boundary to contain their output
					- can you apply filters or neutralizing components inside the system boundary, before the output is released to the host system
					- if so, its possible to generate a bio-system component to generate antibodies

		- component questions
				- what can be used as a filter to prevent certain antibodies from leaving the system boundary? (pathogens, antigens, immune cells, lymph fluid, sub-cellular or macromolecular filter structures)
				- what can be used as a system boundary (chitin, existing membranes, existing fungal/viral cells)

		- alternative questions
				- which processes can be used to execute an alternative to the small/large swapping process and the single-chain variable fragment connection process?
				- can a symmetrical antibody be converted to an asymmetrical antibody so this swapping/alternative process & single-chain variable fragment connection process can be applied

		- extension questions
				- what are the limits of chaining single-chain variable fragments when connecting them to heavy/light chain constant domains to increase binding scope

		- change questions
			- evaluate DNA by its median/average values rather than just original values, given compounding & local system mutations
			
			- how can the system manage nth-degree changes in pathogens to evade existing stressor handlers
					- convert pathogen to its original state that is covered by stressor handlers
					- keep handler in stem state or component state, and add changes at run-time (when it encounters a pathogen rather than at build-time in the immune system process)
					- predict common valuable states or components and aim for producing those rather than covering all situations
					- keep resources to build handler in every cell or a system that interacts with every cell, so it can build its own as needed
					- predict changes up to n degrees away and handle those at build time
					- store altered & original versions in memory cells, or store their common structure/components in memory cells (dont store pieces likely to be altered to evade detection)
					- rather than identifying raw structure, identify patterns of signal manipulation (methods to evade detection, like distortion patterns of macromolecules assembled to signal a different pathogen)
						- can these signal evasion tactics be used to actually convert the pathogen to a handled pathogen, or attach temporary receptors to tag it with?
							- store receptors & attach them to any cell that doesnt pass a host cell filter (displaying cooperative functionality, or identity of host cell type), rather than storing methods of recognizing receptors
							- rather than check if its a pathogen, check if its not a host cell - where can you inject filters that wouldnt disrupt systemic functionality (filters that are temporary & dissolve in blood stream, filters around existing boundaries, filters at build-time)

			- when theres an oversupply of stress handlers (unrestricted cell division), is it better to delegate stress adjacent to but not in the location of the oversupply to distribute it & alert regulating systems to it (through the blood supply & immune system) - so if someone has cancer in one organ, delegate stress adjacent to that organ & then continue distributing it, bc if you stress that organ (request new changes like cell division to replace old cells) it'll just compound the oversupply


		- system questions

			- inject variance sources to handle change types on change platforms

			- salt kills microbes of many kinds, can it be used internally to kill specific microbes of certain structures

			- for conditions that harm a set of filtration organs, can other filtration organs be converted to fulfill its functions temporarily 
				- some kidney functions like fluid balance can be done by other processes like mucus removal (sneezing), salt removal (crying), or fluid removal (vomiting, sweating) - or with chemical processes like evaporation or non-water topical solvents
				- what system relationships exist to fulfill functions of other systems?
				- if this is possible to trigger, what routing mechanisms can redirect inputs to alternate systems?
				- how adjacent/similar does the other function have to be for this to be possible? (lungs can filter out different things than the liver & kidneys)

			- what are the costs of a more active/distributed immune system? do other processes/objects need to be removed or reduced on some attribute for that to be survivable?

			- what other filters exist to build/format components besides:
				- membranes/bonds
				- checkpoints
				- pressure
				- neutralizing processes
				- competition

			- does evolution favor specific solutions, reactive solutions, stable/efficient solutions, or other attributes/types like high-variance solutions?

				- are evolved mechanisms typically a response to one repeated process or many different processes with similar attributes, or are evolved mechanisms just efficient storage units of variation?

			- what combination of elements forms a successful system in the human bio-system?

				- example:

					- immune system analysis:

						- should high-mutation generating processes like somatic hypermutation be derived from a compressed format, so its functionality is applied under stricter conditions requiring the use of instructions to derive it from its compressed form, and is less likely to be misused or accidentally used by hostile processes/pathogens

						- is there a way to tip the system in favor of repair/regeneration/recovery functions rather than deletion or error-prone functions, such as making repair processes happen more often or making those processes more aggressive, in a way that the copying function isnt interfered with, or can protective membranes & other protective tools be used to ensure fewer errors occur, or that copying is done slower or at larger scales and error-heavy versions are destroyed in a competitive filter, so correct copies survive

						- which part of the immune system can wrap/isolate a pathogen with a membrane that is identified as a waste product

						- the immune system can be hijacked, either by a pathogen or by accident, to identify host cell antigens to build antibodies for

							- this is the problem type:
								- a system that matches shapes with shapes doesnt have content-filtering rules built in, only structure-filtering rules

							- to apply a content filtering rule to exclude host cells from this antibody/receptor building process for host cell antigens:

								- the system should be aligned by intent, so this process can only be accessed once an antigen has passed filters proving that its not a host cell antigen, which means there is a legitimate intent to protect against that antigen

								- or in the case of host cells hurting other host cells of another type, in which case some host cells need to be destroyed but normal destruction processes arent activated - the host-cell antigen identification content function can be accessed for that intent

						- can a copy operation be injected into antibody development so every time a change is applied, the whole antibody is copied again with the new change to speed up testing

						- does the antibody production process need to be done in that direction (build a receptor/binding fragment for an antigen and test it, or can core functions or function chains of successful receptor/binding fragment genes be injected in that process to reduce the solution space to try

						- which types of antigens arent coverable (or not efficiently coverable) by the set of components used in VDJ recombination - would another operation be useful or a good replacement for one of those types of gene segments, such as a DNA storage function to align genetic regions that are likelier to build antibodies, or a DNA functionality identification/finding function

						- would it be better to have regions of cells that cant be altered (where all unknown cells are assumed to be pathogens & destroyed), surrounded by or surrounding variable cell groups that can be infected/mutated but which are limited by deactivating membranes & filters which are designed to protect against known pathogens or pathogen patterns

						- can immune cells create decoy cells to test if an unknown compound/pathogen is hostile, encasing the pathogen & decoy cell in a boundary in case the decoy cell is damaged/destroyed by the unknown component, which would identfy it as a pathogen, at which point the immune system would generate antibodies for that component

						- or can it generate many different antibodies, based on a subset of the solution space given the unknown component's matching ratio with existing antibody/receptor structures, deleting any that dont show immediate signs of prevention of cell invasion/destruction, and adjusting the semi-successful preventing antibodies until they're successful against the pathogen

						- can a viral cell be converted to an antibody by replacing its DNA with the antibody's DNA or another useful cell type

							- what functions do pathogens & host/immune cells have in common, so that this process can remove the non-standard functions

							- can immune/stem cells be turned into a virus or borrow its functionality, so they are more accessible & common

							- can a cell or its DNA be embedded/compressed in another cell to activate/build when its needed, so that immune/stem cells can be generated as needed, making cells more independent of the immune system (such as a compressed version of an immune cell whose membrane slowly erodes, so that if its not used/attacked/removed by the host cell, it will eventually activate anyway or be removed anyway once its components/metabolites leak, which will activate or signal an immune process

							- if you place a boundary around some existing antibodies:
								- will it generate heterodimeric antibodies (generated by swapping small/large amino acids to create projections/gaps, in antibody constant region heavy chain segments) 
								- can single-chain variable fragments be applied to these heterodimeric antibodies, and then filtered to release the versions likely to bind to deadly pathogens or a neutralizing process to induce apoptosis for versions unlikely to bind

							- is it more efficient to tag host cells with signals to the immune system not to attack than to identify & adapt to new pathogens, given that there are a subset of host cells that are exposed to pathogen injection points (add an extra lining to these pathways or tag just the cells bounding these pathways)

							- is it more efficient to have a subset-shape scoring system, so if a cell has multiple tags, there is a spectrum of immune attack rather than devoting all available resources split between pathogens

							- is it more efficient to target change types/rates (like converting change types to a constant shape) rather than shapes on their own

							- would it be worth exploring making a new cell type/function that eats a sample of any new cell type and indexes its dna & dna subsets, and if its too different from approved host & microorganism dna, it kills all cells of that type

							- for pathogens with boundaries that cant be handled with existing immune stressors, they can be relocated to a location with functionality to handle them (acidic environments) or that environment can be locally re-created for the duration it takes to kill the pathogen (acidosis)

								- what happens to viruses with glycoprotein shells in the digestive system when they encounter glycoside bond-breaking enzymes like that found in e coli? could you move certain pathogens to the digestive system to be broken?
								https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase

							- what would the optimal set of filters be for any routes for pathogens to enter a host, where the pathogen would have to prove its harmlessness or usefulness to be allowed general access to the bloodstream? are there any structural filters (enzymes, openings) like this in existing organs?

							- would it be worth the investment to engineer strains of useful bacteria to have different structures than known pathogens so pathogens are more identifiable

							- which viruses use glycoproteins or other virus components for energy sources? what host processes could be changed to require viral glycoproteins/components? can endocytosis be induced so glycoproteins are processed in cell organelles

							- can light/electricity/force/heat/salt/alcohol be produced locally by cellular reactions to kill viruses in waves throughout the system

							- can a virus that attacks other viruses be engineered to convert other viruses into those the immune system can fight or create a change supply that the host needs (another change supply like stem cells or other resources, or change demand like building new cells)

							- a calculation virus could be:
								- an interpreter of other viral DNA to determine which stressor handlers the host needs to supply to fight the viruses they have & manipulate their gut bacteria to communicate that information to their brain
								- determining which genetic modifications would produce adjacent useful functionality from the virus & making those edits before it replicates to all cells (present on attack points like skin/mouth)

							- rather than immune cells which tag different cells, there could be feedback loops installed in the process so that a set of useful functions is tested for in foreign cells and if none are found, then its tagged for attack

							- rather than attacking viruses, can you make host cells more competitive/stronger 
								(more aggressive in using foreign cells for energy, more robust DNA editing, more restricted access to cell functions/organelles, make plasmids less accessible to be hijacked so viruses cant adapt using other DNA, make more resources generatable rather than requiring input & the associated openings, strengthening system maintenance so fewer cell transactions/divisions are required)

								or use viruses for host functionality (use viruses to store things that require protection like DNA copies or stored energy formats, since theyre not always permeable)


					- dna system analysis

						- functions from gene position
						- the dna system allows for mutations because functionality isnt linked or enforced in every possible way, to allow for adaptation
							- positioning genes differently could enforce optimal gene combinations, even when edited or when sections between two genes are deleted
							- for example, if the genes are in a sequence of functions where neither copy or delete requires activation:
								activation copy delete
							  and the copy gene is deleted during a legitimate recombination operation, the combination of the activation function & the delete function will still only activate the delete function, which didnt require activation, so theres no systemic impact from a mutation or recombination deleting the copy function (in isolation of other factors)

							- 'activation copy splice delete' might have a different impact, because if copy is removed and the splice function is activated by adjacence, the activated splice function may be able to remove the deletion function

							- this is how position can influence genetic functionality - so finding the optimal position of genes where probable combinations/applications (such as adjacence) are anticipated and used as a filter for possible adjacent/grouped genes

						- storage methods
							- another example would be organization patterns of gene chains
								- are chains of gene segments often stored in an organized shape, or just any shape that fits inside a particular membrane? 
									- what are the likely interactions between two DNA segments that are accidentally grouped together by the DNA strand curling or being distorted in normal ways due to pressure/membranes/other processes?
									- can this organization be streamlined with minimal impact?
									- does the variation in storage of DNA chains produce any functionality that is currently used by the system?

						- gene movement functions
							- another example is common gene switching/traveling operations, like transposones, which often change position in the genome, or chromosomes aligning different gene segments by adjacence using its storage method

						- gene group functions
							- are there almost-full domains in the genome that are still developing in the evolutionary phase but which if completed would add useful functionality

						- is there a structure that can generate certain DNA once nucleic acids are processed, like a filter set in a closed system?
							- for example, putting some core components of DNA in an 'obstacle course' of filters so that they generate the full genome of an organism once the course is complete would be a good backup method implemented as a nanobot if the system cant be minimally adjusted to do that, if there arent existing compression methods storing DNA in related ways
							- this could be used to restore cell DNA after invasion by a pathogen, adding a deletion function to remove the original DNA after it's compromised

						- given existing gene relationship types & functions (adjacent, group, sequence, chromosome, folding/storage location, position-switching, regulation, editing), are there other functions that can be created with few degrees of combinations (or removed) that could optimize the editing process

						- what is the direction of control or other causal structures between interaction layers based on scale/set & other structures of relevance (tad, chromosome, position)?
							- of these causal structures, which are useful for different change demands (which is a variance cascade, which has the fewest side effects, which only changes outputs)

						- can the genome be reduced at all without removing functionality - are there genes that can produce the functions of other genes if removed?

						- can non-coding/unused genes produce useful functionality with extra genes added or with position changes?

						- does DNA operate more as a set of limits/filters than functions/attributes, or is it somewhere in between, or including other structures (paths, subsets, position, system context)
							https://phys.org/news/2020-04-dna-life-bookjust-jumbled-ingredients.html

							- 'what organism ranges are produceable with a specific set of DNA' is a similar question to 'what inner shapes are compatible with a square boundary', where the DNA acts as the boundary

						- the concept of temporary evolution (epigentics changing gene expressions, mutations from structure, stressors & evolved handlers, viruses altering DNA) differs from horizontal & intergenerational evolution

							- temporary evolution may or may not be passed on, whereas horizontal & vertical evolution are likelier to be

							- there are overlaps between the categories: a virus can be considered temporary, horizontal, & vertical evolution

							- temporary evolution may also be localized - genes edited in a certain subset or sub component to conduct experiments or acquire temporary functionality to fix a problem (producing new cells to repair a wound)

							- systemic evolution can be produced when a gene change set triggers a system-wide change

							- pandemic evolution can be produced when a gene change set triggers a pandemic that mutates the species

							- whats the next interface for change in DNA? it already changes on:
								- sets
								- position
								- processing functions (edit, deploy, delete, cluster)
								- emergent functions
								- organization
								- storage
								- usage
								- expression

							- does DNA inclusion fade with lack of use
							- how does DNA compare to other memory storage mechanisms - when is it used as a guide, a set of limits, a set of options, or a checking/validation mechanism, and in which situations?
							- when is DNA an output, an interim cause (middleman), or a catalyst within a living host

						- system position questions
							- which genes are most powerful in a system
							- which genes are unnecessary (have backups/alternates or arent used or dont produce useful functionality)

					- virus system analysis:

						- questions:

							- what strategies to convert pathogens from non-treatable type to a treatable type have been used?

							- if viruses are only hostile bc the organism doesnt have the right genes/structure, what degree of evolution is necessary for a virus to be a useful virus rather than a hostile pathogen? can this evolution be triggered horizontally by stressor patterns? will such an evolution invalidate other necessary components of the host or will it be survivable?

								https://phys.org/news/2020-04-defense-viruses-harmless-beneficial.html

							- with pathogens & DNA (skin cells) as inputs/functions for DNA editing, what combination of viruses can produce:
								- an organ that produces backup copies of DNA packaged in a virus, that is regularly deployed to the bio-system to keep it healthy & free of mutations
								- resistance to a hostile virus

						- measles system analysis: 
							- components, their functions, & relationships to other components:
								- a lipid membrane, the lipid possibly allowing it to travel faster
								- the membrane acts as a platform for surface proteins, its external binding tools, linked to the genome & copying enzyme by internal binding tools matrix proteins
								- surface proteins (hemagglutinin and fusion proteins)
								- hemagglutinin glycoprotein allows red blood cells to group together
								- many backup copies of its genome
								- nucleoprotein as a protective coating of each copy of its genome
								- the protective coating and the genome it protects are chained
								- this chain is flexible, ensuring each copy & coating in the chain are linked to other copies/coatings
								- an RNA-based RNA copying enzyme (so in theory DNA-based enzymes wouldnt have the same impact on the RNA)
								- the copying enzyme is at the outside or ends of the genome/protective nucleoprotein chain but can switch to another part of the chain due to having alternative loops available & a membrane to force interaction with the chain
								- a disordered phosphoprotein in between the copying enzyme and the genome chain, to inject some variation for adaptation in times of trouble

							- this system may appear in other pathogens, but the specific measles implementation of this system only hurts humans


					- medicine:

						- why would a medicine have a side effect?

							- structure:
								- alignment: some intent or attribute aligns with another system object attribute or intent and they coordinate or cluster
								- matching: the medicine's structure matches some other bio system object so it takes the place of that object, causing functionality to be applied that triggers other functions, and invalidating the function of the replaced object
								- neutralization: the medicine's structure neutralizes some bio system function/object
								- conflict: the medicine's structure competes with some bio system function/object
								- layer: the medicine causes objects from one layer to switch layers
								- collision: the medicine has a structure that collides with other structures in a way that disrupts their structure, leading to mutations or cell death

							- cause:
								- the medicine injects or alters causation, taking the place of a causative object, providing an alternative causal path, or blocking/preventing a causal path

							- function:
								- the medicine causes emerging functionality that the system is unprepared for, or misinterprets as a valid process while the artificial activation of that process is missing required inputs

								- intent:
									- the medicine causes one intent to be strengthened (gene deletion) - in backup functions/causes or in defense/protective mechanisms, which causes other intents to be unfulfilled (gene copying)

								- pattern:
									- the medicine causes new patterns of mutations that create unsupported gene expressions (rearranging gene sequences that depend on position)

							- type:
								- the medicine causes a type divergence or other change which the system is unprepared for (gene changes, new cell types to evolve, new antibodies to evolve)

							- system:
								- the medicine removes a difference/distance/node/fills a variance gap (some potential for flexibility) or other system object like boundary conditions that need to exist for the system to work, like spaces in cells to allow for growth or other separations

								- the medicine triggers a variance cascade disrupting the system on multiple interaction layers, or disrupting cross-system interfaces (DNA, energy source, defense mechanisms), attributes (structure, flexibility), objects (cell types, membranes)

							- potential:
								- the medicine changes potential objects (causes stem cells to differentiate, causes DNA to become uneditable, causes irreversible changes)
								- the medicine alters probabilities necessary for system functioning: likelihood of types, likelihood of interaction
								- the medicine distributes un/certainty where it can be harmful (variables, input/output direction) & interfere with other processes

							- change:
								- the medicine may upset the stressor balance in the system, either for a particular patient or for most patients, and a stressor protocol must be applied with the medication to offset this change
								- the medicine may trigger changes that may eventually produce positive mutations, but occur too quick for the system to fulfill with change supply (stem cells, energy)

						- given this analysis you can infer that:

							- certain layers are sub-optimal for interference (delicate interfaces like DNA on the gene layer are highly volatile, and often change on their own from physics or chemical/bio processes, and small changes can cause whole system shut down)

								- however these fragile layers are also sometimes highly causative, and so many solutions can be found on those layers/interfaces, including strengthening this layer (optimizing editing processes, keeping more DNA backups, adding functionality to store & regenerate original DNA sequences, optimizing current storage patterns)

							- certain interfaces are more important than others to analyze for each change (structure/functionality/causation)

							- some strategies are clearly better than others
								- removing a resource-hogging middleman node that has one direct connection between the source & target node is the best possible change to minimize side effects, and other changes are increasingly sub-optimal due to more impact 

								- integrating feedback loops may improve the accuracy of some processes

							- structural damage is the most important thing to prevent (DNA mutations, irrepairable cell types, pathogen invasion)


					- kidney:
					
						- the idea of having a concentration loop for each filtering capsule rather than a network of interchangeable filtering capsules and a network of loops is very fragile
						- the chain of medulla is also extremely fragile
						- the kidney should be more like a series of highways but it's structured like a one-way road & a set of cul de sacs
						- its also extremely sensitive to pressure changes if its impaired at all
						- the pressure-managing function should be isolated from filtering functions bc theyre both crucial, impacting the whole system
						- there needs to be an optimization of this filtering component to make it a series of highways rather than single paths, an extra filtering or pressure system that can get rid of waste products or pathogens when the kidneys & liver & immune system are impaired, which is frequently as theyre very delicate, extra filtering organ stem cells grown in case of damage, or a regenerative function installed
						- whats the benefit from the glomeruli and the other capillary networks have such fragile looping structures - would they be better off as a series of embedded structures with membranes designed to filter substances & eject any unfilterable substances after wrapping them in boundaries or storing them in other cells (like skin cells marked for apoptosis) with endocytosis
						- why does urine need to be concentrated by looping structures at all
						- which enzymes could be injected at which points in the process to increase filtering capacity (breaking up proteins to work with the existing filter system)
						- would ability to produce charge, ionization, or homeostasis-related compounds like sodium or hormones to apply pressure & motion as needed improve filtering functionality
						- why cant more waste products be safely taken to skin as sweat for excretion, what is requiring unhandle-able substances like toxic substances to be routed to kidneys if they cant handle them
						- what happens when capillaries have thicker cell walls, does it hide problems from the immune system or is it just too big for the places theyre usually needed & their size is an advantage, or theyre joined with other capillaries in networks which are prepared to handle blood flow in the event that one capillary is broken
				

			- "memory cells became more diverse after measles wiped out B memory cells" - can you isolate sets of similar b memory cells in a membrane boundary (or other signal to the immune system that stores are depleted) with enough room to grow and they'll develop distortions, or did the wiping out of cells just delete copies so it evened the playing field for other memory cell types to grow?

			- the core objects (DNA, cell types), functions (copy), and sets (amino acids, base pairs, TADs), arent optimal to attack from, since minor changes can break the whole system
			- similarly, the output isnt optimal to attack from, since it doesnt address the root problem & requires repeated application of the solution, which turns it into a monitoring/supply/timing problem
			
			- the interim layers are usually better to start from when considering systemic adjustments to add/change/remove a particular function (memory cell generation), attribute (cell membrane strength), or object set (memory cells)

				- the interim layers are where functions with high implementation variation occur (repair) and their interactions arent necessarily aligned by strict limits (repair is not enforced, and may not have a backup mechanism if one of its inputs is missing)
				- any systemic changes need to allow enough variation to preserve adaptation using existing adaptive systems, while still addressing the problem being solved
				- this means a simplistic solution like 'kill any cell with mutations' cant be implemented, bc that would prevent evolution, and some state of a legitimate deletion/change process might be misinterpreted as a mutation
				- interim layers are also the primary centers of interaction, where system outputs (like a cell surface) can collide with other system outputs with various restrictions
				- in a high-variation system, outputs can cause core functions to change (pollution outputs like CO2 can interfere with immune system core functions), so its not just the interim layer that should be focused on, but for local changes its the best position to start from, and system environment changes can be calculated with more complex causal structures than one direction (from core to interim to output layers)

				- core layer
					- core functions
						- get, send, move, match

				- interim layers:
					- structures
						- boundaries
						- sub-systems
					- states
						- expression/activation
						- cooperation/competition
					- objects
						- energy
					- attributes
						- reversibility
					- functions
						- sub-system functions
							- dna
								- copy, delete, edit, move, activate
							- immune
								- test, rearrange, mark, identify
						- interface functions
							- filtering/enforcing
							- building/combining/grouping

				- output layers:
					- structures
						- distribution/position
					- sub-system
						- dna
							- mutations
			
				- what happens when multiple infections from different pathogens occur at a rate where antibodies for those pathogens are simultaneously generated by this recombination process, or is there prioritization of these antibody-generating processes such as prioritization based on similarity of pathogen to prior pathogens handled by antibodies?

				- can the antibody-generation process be triggered in other systems that can inhabit the host (like antibody-generation processes of a pathogen) and translated to a mammalian format

				- how much & what types of difference are tolerated from the starting structure to the final protein structure of the antibody antigen-binding or t-cell receptor regions?

				- what role do amino acid residues play in the functionality (other than recognition) & are they causative of side effects

				- is there a way to automate testing of combinations of these bounded sub-systems in the bio-system (on a place that is accessible like the skin or not used like the appendix)

				- is local cellular application of this process the right implementation (does it produce useful or harmful variance, given variance injection points)

				- what influences development of sub-systems of immune system (immune organs, humoral, cell-mediated, adaptive), which interfaces dont have a corresponding sub-system of the immune system, and how to apply immune processes to that interface?

				- what permutations of the immune system could produce a bounded system as described above in immune-related organs

				- should the control be injected at the antibody object or the antigen object or another object
					- rather than generating the right antibody, convert the antigen into an antigen for which there is an existing available antibody or an antigen that is adjacent to existing resources (an antibody can definitely be generated for the converted antigen

				- is there a combination of the existing system (immunoglobulin types, processing functions, enzyme usage) that if adjusted could optimize some metric of antibody production

				- is there a cell type that would neutralize the pathogen, but the problem is its not exposed to the pathogen, so the problem is an identification/finding/transport problem rather than an antibody-building problem

				- is there a cell transform that can be executed to make them immune to pathogens temporarily while the pathogens move through the system (toughening of cell membrane, attachment/development of projections or other structures like macromolecules to keep pathogens moving rather than attaching or disrupting cell)

				- can a variance injection point transform be executed to reduce points of entry of pathogens (a transform on skin, lungs, mucus membranes)

				- is an interface transform accessible that could prevent damage of a certain type without changing other system relationships (adjust priority/incentive/type/variance/function/binding/symmetry/position of some layer to prevent attacks on a caused layer)

				- is it more efficient to find sequences that are optimal than to generate them?

				- why cant pathogens like viruses be engineered with original host DNA so original DNA is copied to every cell to help delete mutations as a therapeutic regular treatment

				- is it more efficient to generate sub-components of common successful antibodies & package/deploy these components or their generative functions) than to generate specific antibodies?

				- do the standard processes & their reversal processes need to match up in number/direction? Does cell differentiation need a cell-de-differentiation function available - would that offer more systemic benefits if all functions had a reversing function, or is the system nearer to optimality where such a drastic change would be disruptive rather than conducive to demanded adaptation

				- is there a chain of inputs/outputs not being exploited that could be aligned in the system to reduce system misuse/non-use of resources, or create independent closed trade loops with fewer side effects

				- which nodes in the system are most replaceable/destructible with fewest side effects (so they can be removed or used for high-risk methods like in-system experimentation)

				- which layers & causal shapes are best to attack from (organ, cellular, immune, sub-system, input (most distant root cause accessible), functional, instruction, communication, physics, electricity, chemistry)

				- can you install temporary receptors on cells to act in place of permanent/genetically produced receptors
					- which elements are often used in chemical bonds
						- o-h bonds
						- carbon is often a hub for other bonds to gather & connects well with itself
						- phosphorus
						- sulfur
					- what other methods are used to create bonds
						- charge matching/ionization
						- cadherin proteins

				- which sub-systems would benefit the system if copied to or communicating with another sub-system (an antibody-production system in major organs or filtration organs for testing)

		
		- system/component alternatives

			- is there another process that can replace the antigen-tagging solution produced by antibodies, such as adjacent systemic attribute collisions producing local contexts that invalidate pathogens of various types

					- alternate processes & ways to trigger them
						- using communication/tissue repair processes as an editing function
						- using wound-healing as a building process (fill a gap)
						- using scar tissue as boundaries (tougher than normal tissue)
						- using partially closed structures and openings as filters
						- using projections, speed, electricity, & boundaries as formatters
						- using outputs as signals by default
						- removing boundaries temporarily to share resources

					- aligning molecular motion to create pathways large enough for light to pass through, organizing pathogens to be in its path, applied to subsets of pathogens at a time

						- this may be why acupuncture has worked occasionally - it distributes stress so its not concentrated, it alerts the immune system to pay attention to distributed regions - it doesnt deliver medicine/light/heat but a signal to the immune system, and it can break apart concentrated clusters with which immune cells cant communicate - the same reason exercise may fix or prevent some problems caused by lack of cell communication

						- an alternative is using acupuncture & light to kill cancer cells - so uv rays are delivered to center of tumor with a needle

						- rather than using acupuncture, you can also distribute pain to alert the immune system - a bruise can serve the same purpose, and the rest of the body doesnt have to experience it, just the area in question, to prevent tumors in a susceptible area, without risk of infection from needles

					- molecular motion is also a way to generate variation in cellular structures - what else can you use to increase speed of flow to create different structures, and which areas would that work in so that the errors wouldnt be corrected or filtered out as waste?

					- altering DNA to create output attributes that invalidate pathogen cell structures
					- flow reversal (like lymph fluid flow reversal) to distribute molecules to a part of system demanding them where they wouldn't normally be bc of flow direction
					- flow optimization (creating motion types in various contexts to inject variance in structure that isnt being generated optimally, like increasing speed of blood flow in bone marrow to inject variance in antibody structures)
					- layering testing zones or tools as filtering boundaries radiating outward from the process output
					- mimicking generative conditions of inputs required for processes (mimicking thymus testing zone once its not there)

### Concept interface

	- you can tell a concept from a core object/process by how many ways it can be defined - the more ways it can be defined, the likelier that its a concept
	- specific sub-system concepts are usually traces of abstract concepts applied to structure (like distance is a trace of similarity, which is a trace of the concept of equivalence)
	- they are usually also combinations of core objects/functions rather than the core set themselves

	- sub-system concepts
      - mutations: change without related direct intent (change that shouldnt have been made or could cause problems); distance between optimal & active state
      - signal joint

    - power interface

    - reversibility interface


### Function interface

	- function
	- intent
	- role

    - many object types can be an interface in a specific system, in addition to standard abstract interfaces
      (function/metabolic interface, system/immune interface, structure/cell interface, communication/nerve interface)


#### Limits

### Interaction level interface

    - causal level
        - attacking higher up the causal stack means attacking cancer's evolutionary & learning processes, so it cant evolve resistance to drugs
    
    - object level
        - attacking on the mutation level
          - how to trigger loss-of-function mutations of cancer mutations
          - how to trigger mutations of mutations (reverting to original state)
          - if chains of mutations are the combined trigger, can mutations be inserted in that chain to push it in another functional direction
    
    - system level
        - evaluate position as a variable (whether TADs & gene position & adjacent genes can be rearranged to prevent mutations)
        - evaluate alternative backups to commonly mutated genes/proteins/enzymes - how do you trigger functionality that evolves backups
        - genetic level
          - can genes producing a commonly mutated cancer-causing gene be adjusted to produce functionality without vulnerabilities exploited for cell division
        - functionality level
          - can system structure be changed so variance is increased & so functionality is allowed to accrete to produce backup functionality
        - signaling level 


### Intent interface


### Interface interface


### System interface

	- sub-systems can be organized by interaction layer, attributes (relevance), structure (position), & other interfaces


#### Stressor system

    - change requests are problems of type 'mismatch' between change demand & change supply
    - theres quite a bit of overlap between stressors & handlers bc their role can change depending on contextual usage, but some have clear starting/absolute positions
    - in addition there are objects that stabilize/maintain state rather than help change it
    - one of the reasons these objects help maintain state is because they fill in some of the gaps in the system, preventing exploitative processes from taking over & spreading unrestricted, like a constant
    - matching these stressors with the right number & type & sequence of handlers is key for bio system health
    - some handlers are good universal handlers (exercise, brain usage, water) but sometimes external handlers are needed like medicines until we figure out the stressor combination to trigger adaptive mutations (horizontal evolution)

    - stressor states
      	- good delegation & good matching between stressors/handlers can create an emotional state (happiness)

    - change demand (signal to change) examples:
        - bacteria (hostile)
        - cell damage
        - cell mutation
        - cell communication
        - emotions/pain
        - inflammation
        - pathogen
        - emotions: sadness (restore balance, trigger release of salt), fear (change), disgust (avoid stimulus), anger (switch circuits, focus attention), hope (potential), happiness (stressor-handler match, maintain alternative options, organize to enable delegation)
        - oversupply
        - environmental stress (pollution, lack of resources)
        - conflicting intents (competition)
        - hormones
        - caffeine/stimulants
        - electricity
        - inefficiencies

    - change supply (response to signal) examples:
        - bacteria (attacking hostile bacteria)
        - cell repair
        - cell division
        - cell death (vitamin a)
        - stem cells
        - nutrients
        - perspective/indexing/organization
        - learning
        - exercise/brain usage
        - immune response
        - medicines
        - usage of systems built by hormones (adrenal, growth, reproductive)
        - stored or excess energy
        - filtration/digestion systems (breaking into useful components to handle stresors)
        - functionality retrieval/assembly/sharing functions
        - aligned intents (cooperation)

    - stability/balance object examples:
        - bacteria (performing neutral tasks)
        - genes
        - filtration/digestion (removing unnecessary components)
        - lymph system (interstitial fluid)
        - interstitium
        - blood brain barrier
        - resting states in cycles
        - biological timer
        - pH/electrolyte balance (an interface on which many systems rely)
        - heart (stabilizing blood pressure)
        - understanding (brain networks that store useful functionality)

    - stressor accretion/compounding/neutralizing/type patterns

    - patterns in stressor handler gaps
        - which stressor types/handler types are prioritized first
        - what variables influence priority of stressor handlers

    - variable coordination that produces stressors 
        - repeated interactions from static positions or sources of components
        - mismatches
        - allocation of cell division from low priority tasks (maintaining flexibility/elasticity) to high priority tasks (handling excess inflammation)
