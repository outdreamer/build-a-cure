# Bio system analysis


## Key Questions

    - iterative analysis: 
      - analysis that treats cyclical, recursive, cascading & iterative processes as trade loops between positions & systems
      - example: in addition to analyzing how a drug is metabolized:
        - how its structure will interact with other structures
        - how the resulting structures after the nth-interaction will interact with other resulting structures, etc
        - how the dna of a probiotic or other microorganism treatment could get re-purposed by microorganisms
        - how the activity of a gene could get accidentally impacted in other pathways & which of those pathways are possible given a treatment
        - how an interaction can be minimally modified to produce extremely different results
        - how nth-iteration interactions will be timed with other processes cycling in that time
        - how causal cascades can cycle to be interactive with the treatment
        - how functionality gaps or interactions at nth-iteration can provide opportunities for mutation & other randomness sources 

    - given the known vulnerabilities of the bio-system:
      - which problems are solvable (killing pathogen, deploying a substance to a position) with what methods (evolution, medicine, stressor distribution)
      - which problems are inevitable
      - which problems are solvable with auto-generated vs. external resources
      - which stressor patterns can prevent which problems

## Interfaces

## Core

### Core structures

	- core structures (chain, network, sequence, group, boundary)

### Core concepts


### Core objects

	- elements
		- common: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus
		- rare: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium

    - drug

    - macromolecules
      - proteins, enzymes, lipids

    - microorganisms
      - pathogen

    - change objects
      - mutation

    - defense
      - antibodies
      - memory cells

### Core functions

	- immune functions
		- tagging
		- communication/signaling
		- building antigen-recognizers (antibodies, receptors)

	- DNA functions
		- copying, marking/nicking, identification/recognition, deletion, synthesis, connection, ordering, mutation, activation, transcription, translation, conversion, rearrangement, assembly, expression


### Concept interface

	- you can tell a concept from a core object/process by how many ways it can be defined - the more ways it can be defined, the likelier that its a concept
	- specific sub-system concepts are usually traces of abstract concepts applied to structure (like distance is a trace of similarity, which is a trace of the concept of equivalence)
	- they are usually also combinations of core objects/functions rather than the core set themselves

	- sub-system concepts
      - mutations: change without related direct intent (change that shouldnt have been made or could cause problems); distance between optimal & active state
      - signal joint


### Structure interface

    - many object types can be an interface in a specific system, in addition to standard abstract interfaces
      (function/metabolic interface, system/immune interface, structure/cell interface, communication/nerve interface)


### Type interface

#### Structure types

	- membranes
    - surfaces
    - receptors
    - instructions

#### Relationship types

	- core relationships
        - bind
        - boundary
        - position
        - grouping/accretion
        - distribution
        - testing/assessment/metric selection
        - change
        - regulation
        - communication
        - repair
        - movement
        - duplication
        - request/response handling

	- combination structures 
		- anomaly/counterexample
		- neutralizing/opposing
		- promoting/synergistic
		- symmetry
		- conflict
		- circle
		- core structure combinations

	- distribution structures
		- network

	- organization structures
		- filters

    - explicit function (such as 'convert input energy into output structure')
    - implicit function (such as unintended side effects of outputs, interim functions between input/output, and unpredicted emergent functions at scale or across many linked integrated function chains)
    - provide resources used as inputs to activate other functions (a set of molecules that when detached can activate other processes)
    - connect functionality (binding structures)
    - provide platform for functionality (variance allowing functionality to develop on foundational structures)


#### Attribute types

	- input/output
    - invalidating
        - toxicity (invalidates usefulness of a treatment)

    - variance
        - binding variety
        - movement types (rotation, density distribution)
        - adjacent interfaces (receptor, immune, etc)

    - signaling
        - ionization
        - surface structure
        - vocabulary (interpretability of signals)
        - state change metrics/limits

    - support
        - metabolism
        - filtration

#### Causal types

	- structure
		- network, chain, loop, alternate paths
	
	- interface
		- attribute
		- priority
		- function
		- structure

	- layer
		- scope
		- interaction layer

	- sub-system
		- system-wide systems (immune system, DNA repair system, pressure system)


### Interaction level interface

	- interaction level is determined by which objects are marked as equals so they interact with each other, forming an interaction level/layer, such as the macromolecule layer or the pathogen layer

    - causal level
        - attacking higher up the causal stack means attacking cancer's evolutionary & learning processes, so it cant evolve resistance to drugs
    
    - object level
        - attacking on the mutation level
          - how to trigger loss-of-function mutations of cancer mutations
          - how to trigger mutations of mutations (reverting to original state)
          - if chains of mutations are the combined trigger, can mutations be inserted in that chain to push it in another functional direction
    
    - system level
        - evaluate position as a variable (whether TADs & gene position & adjacent genes can be rearranged to prevent mutations)
        - evaluate alternative backups to commonly mutated genes/proteins/enzymes - how do you trigger functionality that evolves backups
        - genetic level
          - can genes producing a commonly mutated cancer-causing gene be adjusted to produce functionality without vulnerabilities exploited for cell division
        - functionality level
          - can system structure be changed so variance is increased & so functionality is allowed to accrete to produce backup functionality
        - signaling level 


### System interface

#### Stressor system

      - change requests are problems of type 'mismatch' between change demand & change supply
      - theres quite a bit of overlap between stressors & handlers bc their role can change depending on contextual usage, but some have clear starting/absolute positions
      - in addition there are objects that stabilize/maintain state rather than help change it
      - one of the reasons these objects help maintain state is because they fill in some of the gaps in the system, preventing exploitative processes from taking over & spreading unrestricted, like a constant
      - matching these stressors with the right number & type & sequence of handlers is key for bio system health
      - some handlers are good universal handlers (exercise, brain usage, water) but sometimes external handlers are needed like medicines until we figure out the stressor combination to trigger adaptive mutations (horizontal evolution)

      - change demand (signal to change) examples:
        - bacteria (hostile)
        - cell damage
        - cell mutation
        - cell communication
        - emotions/pain
        - inflammation
        - pathogen
        - oversupply
        - environmental stress (pollution, lack of resources)
        - conflicting intents (competition)
        - hormones
        - caffeine/stimulants
        - electricity
        - inefficiencies

      - change supply (response to signal) examples:
        - bacteria (attacking hostile bacteria)
        - cell repair
        - cell division
        - cell death (vitamin a)
        - stem cells
        - nutrients
        - perspective/indexing/organization
        - learning
        - exercise/brain usage
        - immune response
        - medicines
        - usage of systems built by hormones (adrenal, growth, reproductive)
        - stored or excess energy
        - filtration/digestion systems (breaking into useful components to handle stresors)
        - functionality retrieval/assembly/sharing functions
        - aligned intents (cooperation)

      - stability/balance object examples:
        - bacteria (performing neutral tasks)
        - genes
        - filtration/digestion (removing unnecessary components)
        - lymph system (interstitial fluid)
        - interstitium
        - blood brain barrier
        - resting states in cycles
        - biological timer
        - pH/electrolyte balance (an interface on which many systems rely)
        - heart (stabilizing blood pressure)
        - understanding (brain networks that store useful functionality)

      - stressor accretion/compounding/neutralizing/type patterns

      - patterns in stressor handler gaps
        - which stressor types/handler types are prioritized first
        - what variables influence priority of stressor handlers

      - variable coordination that produces stressors 
        - repeated interactions from static positions or sources of components
        - mismatches
        - allocation of cell division from low priority tasks (maintaining flexibility/elasticity) to high priority tasks (handling excess inflammation)
