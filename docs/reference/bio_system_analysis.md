# Bio system analysi

## Core objects

	- elements
		- common: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus
		- rare: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium

## Core functions

	- immune functions
		- tagging
		- communication/signaling
		- building antigen-recognizers (antibodies, receptors)

	- DNA functions
		- copying, marking/nicking, identification/recognition, deletion, synthesis, connection, ordering, mutation, activation, transcription, translation, conversion, rearrangement, assembly, expression

## Types

### Relationship types

	- core structures (chain, network, sequence, group, boundary)

	- combination structures 
		- anomaly/counterexample
		- neutralizing/opposing
		- promoting/synergistic
		- symmetry
		- conflict
		- circle
		- core structure combinations

	- distribution structures
		- network

	- organization structures
		- filters


### Attribute types

	- input/output


### Causal types

	- structure
		- network, chain, loop, alternate paths
	
	- interface
		- attribute
		- priority
		- function
		- structure

	- layer
		- scope
		- interaction layer (which objects are marked as equals so they interact with each other, forming an interaction layer, such as the macromolecule layer or the pathogen layer)

	- sub-system
		- system-wide systems (immune system, DNA repair system, pressure system)
