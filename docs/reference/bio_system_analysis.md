# Bio system analysis


## Key Questions

    - iterative analysis: 
      - analysis that treats cyclical, recursive, cascading & iterative processes as trade loops between positions & systems
      - example: in addition to analyzing how a drug is metabolized:
        - how its structure will interact with other structures
        - how the resulting structures after the nth-interaction will interact with other resulting structures, etc
        - how the dna of a probiotic or other microorganism treatment could get re-purposed by microorganisms
        - how the activity of a gene could get accidentally impacted in other pathways & which of those pathways are possible given a treatment
        - how an interaction can be minimally modified to produce extremely different results
        - how nth-iteration interactions will be timed with other processes cycling in that time
        - how causal cascades can cycle to be interactive with the treatment
        - how functionality gaps or interactions at nth-iteration can provide opportunities for mutation & other randomness sources 

    - given the known vulnerabilities of the bio-system:
      - which problems are solvable (killing pathogen, deploying a substance to a position) with what methods (evolution, medicine, stressor distribution)
      - which problems are inevitable
      - which problems are solvable with auto-generated vs. external resources
      - which stressor patterns can prevent which problems

    - reduce uncertainty in these questions (rule gaps, possible efficiencies, state changes):

    	- immune

			- if you place a boundary around some existing antibodies:
				- will it generate heterodimeric antibodies (generated by swapping small/large amino acids to create projections/gaps, in antibody constant region heavy chain segments) 
				- can single-chain variable fragments be applied to these heterodimeric antibodies, and then filtered to release the versions likely to bind to deadly pathogens or a neutralizing process to induce apoptosis for versions unlikely to bind

		- optimization questions
				- what small/large swaps are optimal for attaching single-chain variable fragments
				- what structure of the boundary is needed
				- what sources of single-chain variable fragments are available
				- is the short linker peptide required to bind the single-chain variable fragments to the heavy/light chain variable segments, or are there other available resources to bind them?

				- bounded system:
					- can single-chain variable fragments be generated in a second region limited by a boundary, then merged with the heterodimeric bounded region when the heterodimeric bounded region is ready for single-chain variable fragments
					- can you place both of these bounded regions in another system boundary to contain their output
					- can you apply filters or neutralizing components inside the system boundary, before the output is released to the host system
					- if so, its possible to generate a bio-system component to generate antibodies

		- component questions
				- what can be used as a filter to prevent certain antibodies from leaving the system boundary? (pathogens, antigens, immune cells, lymph fluid, sub-cellular or macromolecular filter structures)
				- what can be used as a system boundary (chitin, existing membranes, existing fungal/viral cells)

		- alternative questions
				- which processes can be used to execute an alternative to the small/large swapping process and the single-chain variable fragment connection process?
				- can a symmetrical antibody be converted to an asymmetrical antibody so this swapping/alternative process & single-chain variable fragment connection process can be applied

		- extension questions
				- what are the limits of chaining single-chain variable fragments when connecting them to heavy/light chain constant domains to increase binding scope

		- change questions
				- how can the system manage nth-degree changes in pathogens to evade existing stressor handlers
					- convert pathogen to its original state that is covered by stressor handlers
					- keep handler in stem state or component state, and add changes at run-time (when it encounters a pathogen rather than at build-time in the immune system process)
					- predict common valuable states or components and aim for producing those rather than covering all situations
					- keep resources to build handler in every cell or a system that interacts with every cell, so it can build its own as needed
					- predict changes up to n degrees away and handle those at build time
					- store altered & original versions in memory cells, or store their common structure/components in memory cells (dont store pieces likely to be altered to evade detection)
					- rather than identifying raw structure, identify patterns of signal manipulation (methods to evade detection, like distortion patterns of macromolecules assembled to signal a different pathogen)
						- can these signal evasion tactics be used to actually convert the pathogen to a handled pathogen, or attach temporary receptors to tag it with?
							- store receptors & attach them to any cell that doesnt pass a host cell filter (displaying cooperative functionality, or identity of host cell type), rather than storing methods of recognizing receptors
							- rather than check if its a pathogen, check if its not a host cell - where can you inject filters that wouldnt disrupt systemic functionality (filters that are temporary & dissolve in blood stream, filters around existing boundaries, filters at build-time)

		- system questions

			- for conditions that harm a set of filtration organs, can other filtration organs be converted to fulfill its functions temporarily 
				- some kidney functions like fluid balance can be done by other processes like mucus removal (sneezing), salt removal (crying), or fluid removal (vomiting, sweating) - or with chemical processes like evaporation or non-water topical solvents
				- what system relationships exist to fulfill functions of other systems?
				- if this is possible to trigger, what routing mechanisms can redirect inputs to alternate systems?
				- how adjacent/similar does the other function have to be for this to be possible? (lungs can filter out different things than the liver & kidneys)

			- what are the costs of a more active/distributed immune system? do other processes/objects need to be removed or reduced on some attribute for that to be survivable?

			- what combination of elements forms a successful system in the human bio-system?

				- example:

					- immune system analysis:

						- the immune system can be hijacked, either by a pathogen or by accident, to identify host cell antigens to build antibodies for

							- this is the problem type:
								- a system that matches shapes with shapes doesnt have content-filtering rules built in, only structure-filtering rules

							- to apply a content filtering rule to exclude host cells from this antibody/receptor building process for host cell antigens:

								- the system should be aligned by intent, so this process can only be accessed once an antigen has passed filters proving that its not a host cell antigen, which means there is a legitimate intent to protect against that antigen

								- or in the case of host cells hurting other host cells of another type, in which case some host cells need to be destroyed but normal destruction processes arent activated - the host-cell antigen identification content function can be accessed for that intent

						- can a copy operation be injected into antibody development so every time a change is applied, the whole antibody is copied again with the new change to speed up testing

						- does the antibody production process need to be done in that direction (build a receptor/binding fragment for an antigen and test it, or can core functions or function chains of successful receptor/binding fragment genes be injected in that process to reduce the solution space to try

						- which types of antigens arent coverable (or not efficiently coverable) by the set of components used in VDJ recombination - would another operation be useful or a good replacement for one of those types of gene segments, such as a DNA storage function to align genetic regions that are likelier to build antibodies, or a DNA functionality identification/finding function

						- would it be better to have regions of cells that cant be altered (where all unknown cells are assumed to be pathogens & destroyed), surrounded by or surrounding variable cell groups that can be infected/mutated but which are limited by deactivating membranes & filters which are designed to protect against known pathogens or pathogen patterns

						- can immune cells create decoy cells to test if an unknown compound/pathogen is hostile, encasing the pathogen & decoy cell in a boundary in case the decoy cell is damaged/destroyed by the unknown component, which would identfy it as a pathogen, at which point the immune system would generate antibodies for that component

					- dna system analysis

						- functions from gene position
						- the dna system allows for mutations because functionality isnt linked or enforced in every possible way, to allow for adaptation
							- positioning genes differently could enforce optimal gene combinations, even when edited or when sections between two genes are deleted
							- for example, if the genes are in a sequence of functions where neither copy or delete requires activation:
								activation copy delete
							  and the copy gene is deleted during a legitimate recombination operation, the combination of the activation function & the delete function will still only activate the delete function, which didnt require activation, so theres no systemic impact from a mutation or recombination deleting the copy function (in isolation of other factors)

							- 'activation copy splice delete' might have a different impact, because if copy is removed and the splice function is activated by adjacence, the activated splice function may be able to remove the deletion function

							- this is how position can influence genetic functionality - so finding the optimal position of genes where probable combinations/applications (such as adjacence) are anticipated and used as a filter for possible adjacent/grouped genes

						- storage methods
							- another example would be organization patterns of gene chains
								- are chains of gene segments often stored in an organized shape, or just any shape that fits inside a particular membrane? 
									- what are the likely interactions between two DNA segments that are accidentally grouped together by the DNA strand curling or being distorted in normal ways due to pressure/membranes/other processes?
									- can this organization be streamlined with minimal impact?
									- does the variation in storage of DNA chains produce any functionality that is currently used by the system?

						- gene movement functions
							- another example is common gene switching/traveling operations, like transposones, which often change position in the genome, or chromosomes aligning different gene segments by adjacence using its storage method

						- gene group functions
							- are there almost-full domains in the genome that are still developing in the evolutionary phase but which if completed would add useful functionality

						- is there a structure that can generate certain DNA once nucleic acids are processed, like a filter set in a closed system?
							- for example, putting some core components of DNA in an 'obstacle course' of filters so that they generate the full genome of an organism once the course is complete would be a good backup method implemented as a nanobot if the system cant be minimally adjusted to do that, if there arent existing compression methods storing DNA in related ways
							- this could be used to restore cell DNA after invasion by a pathogen, adding a deletion function to remove the original DNA after it's compromised


					- virus system analysis:
						- questions:
							- what strategies to convert pathogens from non-treatable type to a treatable type have been used?

					- measles system analysis: 
						- components, their functions, & relationships to other components:
							- a lipid membrane, the lipid possibly allowing it to travel faster
							- the membrane acts as a platform for surface proteins, its external binding tools, linked to the genome & copying enzyme by internal binding tools matrix proteins
							- surface proteins (hemagglutinin and fusion proteins)
							- hemagglutinin glycoprotein allows red blood cells to group together
							- many backup copies of its genome
							- nucleoprotein as a protective coating of each copy of its genome
							- the protective coating and the genome it protects are chained
							- this chain is flexible, ensuring each copy & coating in the chain are linked to other copies/coatings
							- an RNA-based RNA copying enzyme (so in theory DNA-based enzymes wouldnt have the same impact on the RNA)
							- the copying enzyme is at the outside or ends of the genome/protective nucleoprotein chain but can switch to another part of the chain due to having alternative loops available & a membrane to force interaction with the chain
							- a disordered phosphoprotein in between the copying enzyme and the genome chain, to inject some variation for adaptation in times of trouble

					- this system may appear in other pathogens, but the specific measles implementation of this system only hurts humans

			- "memory cells became more diverse after measles wiped out B memory cells" - can you isolate sets of similar b memory cells in a membrane boundary (or other signal to the immune system that stores are depleted) with enough room to grow and they'll develop distortions, or did the wiping out of cells just delete copies so it evened the playing field for other memory cell types to grow?

			- the core objects (DNA, cell types), functions (copy), and sets (amino acids, base pairs, TADs), arent optimal to attack from, since minor changes can break the whole system
			- similarly, the output isnt optimal to attack from, since it doesnt address the root problem & requires repeated application of the solution, which turns it into a monitoring/supply/timing problem
			
			- the interim layers are usually better to start from when considering systemic adjustments to add/change/remove a particular function (memory cell generation), attribute (cell membrane strength), or object set (memory cells)

				- the interim layers are where functions with high implementation variation occur (repair) and their interactions arent necessarily aligned by strict limits (repair is not enforced, and may not have a backup mechanism if one of its inputs is missing)
				- any systemic changes need to allow enough variation to preserve adaptation using existing adaptive systems, while still addressing the problem being solved
				- this means a simplistic solution like 'kill any cell with mutations' cant be implemented, bc that would prevent evolution, and some state of a legitimate deletion/change process might be misinterpreted as a mutation
				- interim layers are also the primary centers of interaction, where system outputs (like a cell surface) can collide with other system outputs with various restrictions
				- in a high-variation system, outputs can cause core functions to change (pollution outputs like CO2 can interfere with immune system core functions), so its not just the interim layer that should be focused on, but for local changes its the best position to start from, and system environment changes can be calculated with more complex causal structures than one direction (from core to interim to output layers)

				- core layer
					- core functions
						- get, send, move, match

				- interim layers:
					- structures
						- boundaries
						- sub-systems
					- states
						- expression/activation
						- cooperation/competition
					- objects
						- energy
					- attributes
						- reversibility
					- functions
						- sub-system functions
							- dna
								- copy, delete, edit, move, activate
							- immune
								- test, rearrange, mark, identify
						- interface functions
							- filtering/enforcing
							- building/combining/grouping

				- output layers:
					- structures
						- distribution/position
					- sub-system
						- dna
							- mutations
			
				- what happens when multiple infections from different pathogens occur at a rate where antibodies for those pathogens are simultaneously generated by this recombination process, or is there prioritization of these antibody-generating processes such as prioritization based on similarity of pathogen to prior pathogens handled by antibodies?

				- can the antibody-generation process be triggered in other systems that can inhabit the host (like antibody-generation processes of a pathogen) and translated to a mammalian format

				- how much & what types of difference are tolerated from the starting structure to the final protein structure of the antibody antigen-binding or t-cell receptor regions?

				- what role do amino acid residues play in the functionality (other than recognition) & are they causative of side effects

				- is there a way to automate testing of combinations of these bounded sub-systems in the bio-system (on a place that is accessible like the skin or not used like the appendix)

				- is local cellular application of this process the right implementation (does it produce useful or harmful variance, given variance injection points)

				- what influences development of sub-systems of immune system (immune organs, humoral, cell-mediated, adaptive), which interfaces dont have a corresponding sub-system of the immune system, and how to apply immune processes to that interface?

				- what permutations of the immune system could produce a bounded system as described above in immune-related organs

				- should the control be injected at the antibody object or the antigen object or another object
					- rather than generating the right antibody, convert the antigen into an antigen for which there is an existing available antibody or an antigen that is adjacent to existing resources (an antibody can definitely be generated for the converted antigen

				- is there a combination of the existing system (immunoglobulin types, processing functions, enzyme usage) that if adjusted could optimize some metric of antibody production

				- is there a cell type that would neutralize the pathogen, but the problem is its not exposed to the pathogen, so the problem is an identification/finding/transport problem rather than an antibody-building problem

				- is there a cell transform that can be executed to make them immune to pathogens temporarily while the pathogens move through the system (toughening of cell membrane, attachment/development of projections or other structures like macromolecules to keep pathogens moving rather than attaching or disrupting cell)

				- can a variance injection point transform be executed to reduce points of entry of pathogens (a transform on skin, lungs, mucus membranes)

				- is an interface transform accessible that could prevent damage of a certain type without changing other system relationships (adjust priority/incentive/type/variance/function/binding/symmetry/position of some layer to prevent attacks on a caused layer)

				- is it more efficient to find sequences that are optimal than to generate them?

				- why cant pathogens like viruses be engineered with original host DNA so original DNA is copied to every cell to help delete mutations as a therapeutic regular treatment

				- is it more efficient to generate sub-components of common successful antibodies & package/deploy these components or their generative functions) than to generate specific antibodies?

				- do the standard processes & their reversal processes need to match up in number/direction? Does cell differentiation need a cell-de-differentiation function available - would that offer more systemic benefits if all functions had a reversing function, or is the system nearer to optimality where such a drastic change would be disruptive rather than conducive to demanded adaptation

				- is there a chain of inputs/outputs not being exploited that could be aligned in the system to reduce system misuse/non-use of resources, or create independent closed trade loops with fewer side effects

				- which nodes in the system are most replaceable/destructible with fewest side effects (so they can be removed or used for high-risk methods like in-system experimentation)

				- which layers & causal shapes are best to attack from (organ, cellular, immune, sub-system, input (most distant root cause accessible), functional, instruction, communication, physics, electricity, chemistry)

				- can you install temporary receptors on cells to act in place of permanent/genetically produced receptors
					- which elements are often used in chemical bonds
						- o-h bonds
						- carbon is often a hub for other bonds to gather & connects well with itself
						- phosphorus
						- sulfur
					- what other methods are used to create bonds
						- charge matching/ionization
						- cadherin proteins

				- which sub-systems would benefit the system if copied to or communicating with another sub-system (an antibody-production system in major organs or filtration organs for testing)

		
		- system/component alternatives

			- is there another process that can replace the antigen-tagging solution produced by antibodies, such as adjacent systemic attribute collisions producing local contexts that invalidate pathogens of various types

					- alternate processes & ways to trigger them
						- using communication/tissue repair processes as an editing function
						- using wound-healing as a building process (fill a gap)
						- using scar tissue as boundaries (tougher than normal tissue)
						- using partially closed structures and openings as filters
						- using projections, speed, electricity, & boundaries as formatters
						- using outputs as signals by default
						- removing boundaries temporarily to share resources

					- aligning molecular motion to create pathways large enough for light to pass through, organizing pathogens to be in its path, applied to subsets of pathogens at a time

						- this may be why acupuncture has worked occasionally - it distributes stress so its not concentrated, it alerts the immune system to pay attention to distributed regions - it doesnt deliver medicine/light/heat but a signal to the immune system, and it can break apart concentrated clusters with which immune cells cant communicate - the same reason exercise may fix or prevent some problems caused by lack of cell communication

						- rather than using acupuncture, you can also distribute pain to alert the immune system - a bruise can serve the same purpose, and the rest of the body doesnt have to experience it, just the area in question, to prevent tumors in a susceptible area, without risk of infection from needles

					- molecular motion is also a way to generate variation in cellular structures - what else can you use to increase speed of flow to create different structures, and which areas would that work in so that the errors wouldnt be corrected or filtered out as waste?

					- altering DNA to create output attributes that invalidate pathogen cell structures
					- flow reversal (like lymph fluid flow reversal) to distribute molecules to a part of system demanding them where they wouldn't normally be bc of flow direction
					- flow optimization (creating motion types in various contexts to inject variance in structure that isnt being generated optimally, like increasing speed of blood flow in bone marrow to inject variance in antibody structures)
					- layering testing zones or tools as filtering boundaries radiating outward from the process output
					- mimicking generative conditions of inputs required for processes (mimicking thymus testing zone once its not there)

### Interaction level interface

    - causal level
        - attacking higher up the causal stack means attacking cancer's evolutionary & learning processes, so it cant evolve resistance to drugs
    
    - object level
        - attacking on the mutation level
          - how to trigger loss-of-function mutations of cancer mutations
          - how to trigger mutations of mutations (reverting to original state)
          - if chains of mutations are the combined trigger, can mutations be inserted in that chain to push it in another functional direction
    
    - system level
        - evaluate position as a variable (whether TADs & gene position & adjacent genes can be rearranged to prevent mutations)
        - evaluate alternative backups to commonly mutated genes/proteins/enzymes - how do you trigger functionality that evolves backups

        - signaling level 


### Intent interface


### Interface interface


### System interface

	- sub-systems can be organized by interaction layer, attributes (relevance), structure (position), & other interfaces


#### Stressor system

    - change requests are problems of type 'mismatch' between change demand & change supply
    - theres quite a bit of overlap between stressors & handlers bc their role can change depending on contextual usage, but some have clear starting/absolute positions
    - in addition there are objects that stabilize/maintain state rather than help change it
    - one of the reasons these objects help maintain state is because they fill in some of the gaps in the system, preventing exploitative processes from taking over & spreading unrestricted, like a constant
    - matching these stressors with the right number & type & sequence of handlers is key for bio system health
    - some handlers are good universal handlers (exercise, brain usage, water) but sometimes external handlers are needed like medicines until we figure out the stressor combination to trigger adaptive mutations (horizontal evolution)

    - stressor states
      	- good delegation & good matching between stressors/handlers can create an emotional state (happiness)

    - change demand (signal to change) examples:
        - bacteria (hostile)
        - cell damage
        - cell mutation
        - cell communication
        - emotions/pain
        - inflammation
        - pathogen
        - emotions: sadness (restore balance, trigger release of salt), fear (change), disgust (avoid stimulus), anger (switch circuits, focus attention), hope (potential), happiness (stressor-handler match, maintain alternative options, organize to enable delegation)
        - oversupply
        - environmental stress (pollution, lack of resources)
        - conflicting intents (competition)
        - hormones
        - caffeine/stimulants
        - electricity
        - inefficiencies

    - change supply (response to signal) examples:
        - bacteria (attacking hostile bacteria)
        - cell repair
        - cell division
        - cell death (vitamin a)
        - stem cells
        - nutrients
        - perspective/indexing/organization
        - learning
        - exercise/brain usage
        - immune response
        - medicines
        - usage of systems built by hormones (adrenal, growth, reproductive)
        - stored or excess energy
        - filtration/digestion systems (breaking into useful components to handle stresors)
        - functionality retrieval/assembly/sharing functions
        - aligned intents (cooperation)

    - stability/balance object examples:
        - bacteria (performing neutral tasks)
        - genes
        - filtration/digestion (removing unnecessary components)
        - lymph system (interstitial fluid)
        - interstitium
        - blood brain barrier
        - resting states in cycles
        - biological timer
        - pH/electrolyte balance (an interface on which many systems rely)
        - heart (stabilizing blood pressure)
        - understanding (brain networks that store useful functionality)

    - stressor accretion/compounding/neutralizing/type patterns

    - patterns in stressor handler gaps
        - which stressor types/handler types are prioritized first
        - what variables influence priority of stressor handlers

    - variable coordination that produces stressors 
        - repeated interactions from static positions or sources of components
        - mismatches
        - allocation of cell division from low priority tasks (maintaining flexibility/elasticity) to high priority tasks (handling excess inflammation)
