# Bio system analysis


## Key Questions

    - iterative analysis: 
      - analysis that treats cyclical, recursive, cascading & iterative processes as trade loops between positions & systems
      - example: in addition to analyzing how a drug is metabolized:
        - how its structure will interact with other structures
        - how the resulting structures after the nth-interaction will interact with other resulting structures, etc
        - how the dna of a probiotic or other microorganism treatment could get re-purposed by microorganisms
        - how the activity of a gene could get accidentally impacted in other pathways & which of those pathways are possible given a treatment
        - how an interaction can be minimally modified to produce extremely different results
        - how nth-iteration interactions will be timed with other processes cycling in that time
        - how causal cascades can cycle to be interactive with the treatment
        - how functionality gaps or interactions at nth-iteration can provide opportunities for mutation & other randomness sources 

    - given the known vulnerabilities of the bio-system:
      - which problems are solvable (killing pathogen, deploying a substance to a position) with what methods (evolution, medicine, stressor distribution)
      - which problems are inevitable
      - which problems are solvable with auto-generated vs. external resources
      - which stressor patterns can prevent which problems

    - reduce uncertainty in these questions (rule gaps, possible efficiencies, state changes):

    	- immune

			- if you place a boundary around some existing antibodies:
				- will it generate heterodimeric antibodies (generated by swapping small/large amino acids to create projections/gaps, in antibody constant region heavy chain segments) 
				- can single-chain variable fragments be applied to these heterodimeric antibodies, and then filtered to release the versions likely to bind to deadly pathogens or a neutralizing process to induce apoptosis for versions unlikely to bind

		- optimization questions
				- what small/large swaps are optimal for attaching single-chain variable fragments
				- what structure of the boundary is needed
				- what sources of single-chain variable fragments are available
				- is the short linker peptide required to bind the single-chain variable fragments to the heavy/light chain variable segments, or are there other available resources to bind them?

				- bounded system:
					- can single-chain variable fragments be generated in a second region limited by a boundary, then merged with the heterodimeric bounded region when the heterodimeric bounded region is ready for single-chain variable fragments
					- can you place both of these bounded regions in another system boundary to contain their output
					- can you apply filters or neutralizing components inside the system boundary, before the output is released to the host system
					- if so, its possible to generate a bio-system component to generate antibodies

		- component questions
				- what can be used as a filter to prevent certain antibodies from leaving the system boundary? (pathogens, antigens, immune cells, lymph fluid, sub-cellular or macromolecular filter structures)
				- what can be used as a system boundary (chitin, existing membranes, existing fungal/viral cells)

		- alternative questions
				- which processes can be used to execute an alternative to the small/large swapping process and the single-chain variable fragment connection process?
				- can a symmetrical antibody be converted to an asymmetrical antibody so this swapping/alternative process & single-chain variable fragment connection process can be applied

		- extension questions
				- what are the limits of chaining single-chain variable fragments when connecting them to heavy/light chain constant domains to increase binding scope

		- change questions
				- how can the system manage nth-degree changes in pathogens to evade existing stressor handlers
					- convert pathogen to its original state that is covered by stressor handlers
					- keep handler in stem state or component state, and add changes at run-time (when it encounters a pathogen rather than at build-time in the immune system process)
					- predict common valuable states or components and aim for producing those rather than covering all situations
					- keep resources to build handler in every cell or a system that interacts with every cell, so it can build its own as needed
					- predict changes up to n degrees away and handle those at build time
					- store altered & original versions in memory cells, or store their common structure/components in memory cells (dont store pieces likely to be altered to evade detection)
					- rather than identifying raw structure, identify patterns of signal manipulation (methods to evade detection, like distortion patterns of macromolecules assembled to signal a different pathogen)
						- can these signal evasion tactics be used to actually convert the pathogen to a handled pathogen, or attach temporary receptors to tag it with?
							- store receptors & attach them to any cell that doesnt pass a host cell filter (displaying cooperative functionality, or identity of host cell type), rather than storing methods of recognizing receptors
							- rather than check if its a pathogen, check if its not a host cell - where can you inject filters that wouldnt disrupt systemic functionality (filters that are temporary & dissolve in blood stream, filters around existing boundaries, filters at build-time)

		- system questions
			
				- what happens when multiple infections from different pathogens occur at a rate where antibodies for those pathogens are simultaneously generated by this recombination process, or is there prioritization of these antibody-generating processes such as prioritization based on similarity of pathogen to prior pathogens handled by antibodies?

				- can the antibody-generation process be triggered in other systems that can inhabit the host (like antibody-generation processes of a pathogen) and translated to a mammalian format

				- how much & what types of difference are tolerated from the starting structure to the final protein structure of the antibody antigen-binding or t-cell receptor regions?

				- what role do amino acid residues play in the functionality (other than recognition) & are they causative of side effects

				- is there a way to automate testing of combinations of these bounded sub-systems in the bio-system (on a place that is accessible like the skin or not used like the appendix)

				- is local cellular application of this process the right implementation (does it produce useful or harmful variance, given variance injection points)

				- what influences development of sub-systems of immune system (immune organs, humoral, cell-mediated, adaptive), which interfaces dont have a corresponding sub-system of the immune system, and how to apply immune processes to that interface?

				- what permutations of the immune system could produce a bounded system as described above in immune-related organs

				- should the control be injected at the antibody object or the antigen object or another object
					- rather than generating the right antibody, convert the antigen into an antigen for which there is an existing available antibody or an antigen that is adjacent to existing resources (an antibody can definitely be generated for the converted antigen

				- is there a combination of the existing system (immunoglobulin types, processing functions, enzyme usage) that if adjusted could optimize some metric of antibody production

				- is there a cell type that would neutralize the pathogen, but the problem is its not exposed to the pathogen, so the problem is an identification/finding/transport problem rather than an antibody-building problem

				- is there a cell transform that can be executed to make them immune to pathogens temporarily while the pathogens move through the system (toughening of cell membrane, attachment/development of projections or other structures like macromolecules to keep pathogens moving rather than attaching or disrupting cell)

				- can a variance injection point transform be executed to reduce points of entry of pathogens (a transform on skin, lungs, mucus membranes)

				- is an interface transform accessible that could prevent damage of a certain type without changing other system relationships (adjust priority/incentive/type/variance/function/binding/symmetry/position of some layer to prevent attacks on a caused layer)

				- is it more efficient to find sequences that are optimal than to generate them?

				- why cant pathogens like viruses be engineered with original host DNA so original DNA is copied to every cell to help delete mutations as a therapeutic regular treatment

				- is it more efficient to generate sub-components of common successful antibodies & package/deploy these components or their generative functions) than to generate specific antibodies?

				- do the standard processes & their reversal processes need to match up in number/direction? Does cell differentiation need a cell-de-differentiation function available - would that offer more systemic benefits if all functions had a reversing function, or is the system nearer to optimality where such a drastic change would be disruptive rather than conducive to demanded adaptation

				- is there a chain of inputs/outputs not being exploited that could be aligned in the system to reduce system misuse/non-use of resources, or create independent closed trade loops with fewer side effects

				- which nodes in the system are most replaceable/destructible with fewest side effects (so they can be removed or used for high-risk methods like in-system experimentation)

				- which layers & causal shapes are best to attack from (organ, cellular, immune, sub-system, input (most distant root cause accessible), functional, instruction, communication, physics, electricity, chemistry)

				- can you install temporary receptors on cells to act in place of permanent/genetically produced receptors
					- which elements are often used in chemical bonds
						- o-h bonds
						- carbon is often a hub for other bonds to gather & connects well with itself
						- phosphorus
						- sulfur
					- what other methods are used to create bonds
						- charge matching/ionization
						- cadherin proteins

				- which sub-systems would benefit the system if copied to or communicating with another sub-system (an antibody-production system in major organs or filtration organs for testing)

		
		- alternatives

			- is there another process that can replace the antigen-tagging solution produced by antibodies, such as adjacent systemic attribute collisions producing local contexts that invalidate pathogens of various types

					- alternate processes & ways to trigger them
						- using communication/tissue repair processes as an editing function
						- using wound-healing as a building process (fill a gap)
						- using scar tissue as boundaries (tougher than normal tissue)
						- using partially closed structures and openings as filters
						- using projections, speed, electricity, & boundaries as formatters
						- using outputs as signals by default
						- removing boundaries temporarily to share resources

					- aligning molecular motion to create pathways large enough for light to pass through, organizing pathogens to be in its path, applied to subsets of pathogens at a time

						- this may be why acupuncture has worked occasionally - it distributes stress so its not concentrated, it alerts the immune system to pay attention to distributed regions - it doesnt deliver medicine/light/heat but a signal to the immune system, and it can break apart concentrated clusters with which immune cells cant communicate - the same reason exercise may fix or prevent some problems caused by lack of cell communication

						- rather than using acupuncture, you can also distribute pain to alert the immune system - a bruise can serve the same purpose, and the rest of the body doesnt have to experience it, just the area in question, to prevent tumors in a susceptible area, without risk of infection from needles

					- molecular motion is also a way to generate variation in cellular structures - what else can you use to increase speed of flow to create different structures, and which areas would that work in so that the errors wouldnt be corrected or filtered out as waste?

					- altering DNA to create output attributes that invalidate pathogen cell structures
					- flow reversal (like lymph fluid flow reversal) to distribute molecules to a part of system demanding them where they wouldn't normally be bc of flow direction
					- flow optimization (creating motion types in various contexts to inject variance in structure that isnt being generated optimally, like increasing speed of blood flow in bone marrow to inject variance in antibody structures)
					- layering testing zones or tools as filtering boundaries radiating outward from the process output
					- mimicking generative conditions of inputs required for processes (mimicking thymus testing zone once its not there)

	    - platform functions
	    	- provide platform for functionality (variance allowing functionality to develop on foundational structures)

### Interaction level interface

	- interaction level is determined by which objects are marked as equals so they interact with each other, forming an interaction level/layer, such as the macromolecule layer or the pathogen layer

    - causal level
        - attacking higher up the causal stack means attacking cancer's evolutionary & learning processes, so it cant evolve resistance to drugs
    
    - object level
        - attacking on the mutation level
          - how to trigger loss-of-function mutations of cancer mutations
          - how to trigger mutations of mutations (reverting to original state)
          - if chains of mutations are the combined trigger, can mutations be inserted in that chain to push it in another functional direction
    
    - system level
        - evaluate position as a variable (whether TADs & gene position & adjacent genes can be rearranged to prevent mutations)
        - evaluate alternative backups to commonly mutated genes/proteins/enzymes - how do you trigger functionality that evolves backups
        - genetic level
          - can genes producing a commonly mutated cancer-causing gene be adjusted to produce functionality without vulnerabilities exploited for cell division
        - functionality level
          - can system structure be changed so variance is increased & so functionality is allowed to accrete to produce backup functionality
        - signaling level 


### Interface interface

	- identifying sub-interfaces (electricity, potential, similarity) is an important first step before doing other analysis, because if you can identify the important/causative interfaces right away, you can ignore a lot of information


### System interface

	- sub-systems can be organized by interaction layer, attributes (relevance), structure (position), & other interfaces


#### Stressor system

    - change requests are problems of type 'mismatch' between change demand & change supply
    - theres quite a bit of overlap between stressors & handlers bc their role can change depending on contextual usage, but some have clear starting/absolute positions
    - in addition there are objects that stabilize/maintain state rather than help change it
    - one of the reasons these objects help maintain state is because they fill in some of the gaps in the system, preventing exploitative processes from taking over & spreading unrestricted, like a constant
    - matching these stressors with the right number & type & sequence of handlers is key for bio system health
    - some handlers are good universal handlers (exercise, brain usage, water) but sometimes external handlers are needed like medicines until we figure out the stressor combination to trigger adaptive mutations (horizontal evolution)

    - stressor states
      	- good delegation & good matching between stressors/handlers can create an emotional state (happiness)

    - change demand (signal to change) examples:
        - bacteria (hostile)
        - cell damage
        - cell mutation
        - cell communication
        - emotions/pain
        - inflammation
        - pathogen
        - emotions: sadness (restore balance, trigger release of salt), fear (change), disgust (avoid stimulus), anger (switch circuits, focus attention), hope (potential), happiness (maintain alternative options, delegate)
        - oversupply
        - environmental stress (pollution, lack of resources)
        - conflicting intents (competition)
        - hormones
        - caffeine/stimulants
        - electricity
        - inefficiencies

    - change supply (response to signal) examples:
        - bacteria (attacking hostile bacteria)
        - cell repair
        - cell division
        - cell death (vitamin a)
        - stem cells
        - nutrients
        - perspective/indexing/organization
        - learning
        - exercise/brain usage
        - immune response
        - medicines
        - usage of systems built by hormones (adrenal, growth, reproductive)
        - stored or excess energy
        - filtration/digestion systems (breaking into useful components to handle stresors)
        - functionality retrieval/assembly/sharing functions
        - aligned intents (cooperation)

    - stability/balance object examples:
        - bacteria (performing neutral tasks)
        - genes
        - filtration/digestion (removing unnecessary components)
        - lymph system (interstitial fluid)
        - interstitium
        - blood brain barrier
        - resting states in cycles
        - biological timer
        - pH/electrolyte balance (an interface on which many systems rely)
        - heart (stabilizing blood pressure)
        - understanding (brain networks that store useful functionality)

    - stressor accretion/compounding/neutralizing/type patterns

    - patterns in stressor handler gaps
        - which stressor types/handler types are prioritized first
        - what variables influence priority of stressor handlers

    - variable coordination that produces stressors 
        - repeated interactions from static positions or sources of components
        - mismatches
        - allocation of cell division from low priority tasks (maintaining flexibility/elasticity) to high priority tasks (handling excess inflammation)
