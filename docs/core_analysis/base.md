# Bases

  - there are conceptual bases (power), intent bases (motion, increase, efficiency), type bases (number type, variable type), structural bases (value, position, distance, set)

  - if the interface network (position of power with respect to balance, interfaces like intent/concept/structure) is static, there is a limited supply of change/potential/power in the universe/system, and change should be allocated non-randomly (priorities matter)


## Examples

    - example of power-based change:

        - as power (degree of dependency) changes, what else changes:
          - previously distant points become equal to adjacent points as power increases
          - value reverts a concept & the information of the value loses its meaning
          - dimension space can be determined by the degree of dependency

        - this can be framed based on potential (bc power can change with respect to options), variance (because power can change with respect to change), and time (bc power can change over time)

    - example of potential-based change:
    
        - as potential (possible change) increases,
          - what probabilities/possibilities become possible
          - what possibilities become adjacent/distant
          
        - as potential changes, how do potential objects/types vary based on the unit of potential (possibility distance, distance between required limits & optional steps)
        - this can be framed on a base of time, because time is a related object to potential (if there is no potential, there is no time)

    - example of variance-based change:
        - changing stabilization based on randomness
        - changing interface development based on randomness
        - changing systematization based on randomness
        - as change increases, what change objects (types/rules/rates/direction) alter position/connection/distance/existence?
          - what else changes
          - what aspects of change are altered
          - what core change functions develop or change
          - where does change go if there isnt enough time to contain it
          - what change rates change
          - what stabilizes
          - what patterns emerge
          - what change cascades are triggered
          - what changes develop into randomness
          - what change combinations produce change rate/type/interface changes
        
        - this is a removal of the time parameter, by assigning distance to change types/rates/other metadata, so that any change is framed in terms of a base unit of change (how much change it produces, by making other objects nearer, creating other objects, and connecting with other objects)

        - this can be framed on a base of potential, because potential is a related object to change (if there is no potential, there is no change)
        - this can be framed on a base of time, because time is a related object to change (if there is no time, there is no change)

    - example of time-based change:
      - as time increases, what changes:
        - position
        - value (position on a dimension)
        - distance (position from a base point)
      - changing position based on time
