# Bases


  - there are conceptual bases (power), intent bases (motion, increase, efficiency), type bases (number type, variable type), structural bases (value, position, distance, set), change bases (rate, possibility/opportunity difference, randomness ratio, change interface stack, change type)

  - if the interface network (position of power with respect to balance, interfaces like intent/concept/structure) is static, there is a limited supply of change/potential/power in the universe/system, and change should be allocated non-randomly (priorities matter)

  - if the interface network is not static (you can change the position of power with respect to balance, you can change base interfaces), then information should be standardized to a set of filtering interfaces, because the filters will host the most changes & changes to the filters will cause other changes

  - selecting a space (dimension set) for framing changes of a certain type

    - selecting a space involves selecting a representation of information by intent

      - various representations of a function between x & y exist, each with their own intent (hide information, emphasize information, distort information)

        - the selected space should be that which aligns with the intent of the target space (displaying a representative sample, displaying the most diverse variety of samples)

      - changing the base is a way to change the interface used to represent information

      - adding dimensions changes intent of switching spaces (adding complexity or clarity)

      - certain change types have certain intents associated
        
        - potential-based change is aligned with intents like prediction (finding patterns like convergence or cascades)

      - some changes are complex (changing many different things) that cannot be clearly depicted as an increase or decrease, but are still noteworthy as they are adjacent to an increase or decrease (increase the probability of an increase or decrease) even if they dont register on that dimension set

        - in this case, a set or network of related spaces can be used to represent the change

        - other spaces can also change what value means in that space, to represent more complex attributes like concepts (potential), where a change alters several metadata attributes of that base concept (potential direction/reversibility/alternative count/probability of alternatives leading to more potential)

        - for example, a change may not directly/measurably increase the potential of a system, but it could be similar to changes that preceded an increase in potential of a system, so it should be represented on a pattern dimension set (representing the similarity to the other pattern) or a similarity/change dimension set (depicting the similarity to that other preceding pattern's intra-differences within itself), even if it can only be represented as a point rather than a change on the potential dimension set

        - patterns are related to potential bc if something is too compliant with patterns, its less likely to change, which is an object of potential

      - with regard to graphing potential itself, it's more useful to use position as a base rather than time
        - how does potential change with respect to starting position?
        - if a starting position is isolated, there is less potential for dependence & more potential for independence (the net impact on overall potential is variable)
        - this reveals more information about actual potential change types by placing useful limits on value ranges

      - identifying the variance structures (gaps/cascades/filters) in a system will help identify the best dimension sets to frame certain change types in


## Examples


    - example of interface-based change:

      - as change increases, which interfaces are more/less adjacent, where interfaces are represented as a set of filters, each additional filter being a unit of change on the x-axis, and each subsequent filter being one distortion away from the previous filter, where the origin is the most standard filter


    - example of context-based change:

      - as change increases, how does context change (where unit of context are additional conditions)


    - example of structure-based change:

      - example of time-based change:

        - as time increases, what changes:
          - position
          - value (position on a dimension)
          - distance (position from a base point)

        - changing position based on time


      - example of structure-based change:

        - as change increases, what structures change (which structures are stable even in certain change rates)

      - other standard structural bases as alternatives to time, where change is on a y-axis, and these parameters are on the x-axis

        - order: changes are framed based on order - to examine change patterns with respect to order (where unit order is original/standard and highest order is most different order possible)
        - position: changes are framed based on difference from previous position, starting from the standard unit position (default) - for examining change patterns with respect to position distortion
        - distance: changes are framed based on distance type (distance from value, distance from number type, distance from pattern) - for examining change patterns with respect to distance type
        - value: changes are framed based on value type (exponential, constant, pattern value, symmetric value, origin value) - for examining change patterns with respect to value
        - set: changes are framed based on set membership (number type (prime), pattern (progression), distance (adjacent groups)) - for examining change patterns with respect to sets
        - space: changes are framed based on spaces where that change can be framed (topologies, dimensions, vector spaces) - where spaces are formed by adding dimension units

      - example of object-based change:
        - as change increases, what objects (type/variable/inputs/cause) are more/less adjacent 


    - example of concept-based change:

      - as change increases, how does concept (similarity) change

      - example of power-based change:

          - as power (degree of dependency) changes, what else changes:

            - previously distant points become equal to adjacent points as power increases
            - value reverts a concept & the information of the value loses its meaning
            - dimension space can be determined by the degree of dependency
            - does a change increase or reduce power?

          - this can be framed based on potential (bc power can change with respect to options), variance (because power can change with respect to change), and time (bc power can change over time)


      - example of potential-based change:
      
          - as change increases, how does potential (possible change) increase:

            - what probabilities/possibilities become possible (findable/generatable in structural dimensions/on the structural interface)
            - what possibilities become adjacent/distant
            - does a change increase or reduce potential options?

          - as potential changes, how do potential objects/types vary based on the unit of potential (possibility distance, distance between required limits & optional steps)
          - this can be framed on a base of time, because time is a related object to potential (if there is no potential, there is no time)


      - example of variance-based change:

          - changing stabilization based on randomness
          - changing interface development based on randomness
          - changing systematization based on randomness
          - changing object change based on a changeable interface (change stack, like changing orientation of an object within a system that is changing)
          - changing change types (variance leak, variance cascades/activation, variance injection, compounding variance, variance approaching an interface, variance distribution)

          - does a change increase or reduce change sources?

          - as change increases, what change objects (types/rules/rates/direction) alter position/connection/distance/existence?
            - what else changes
            - what aspects of change are altered
            - what core change functions develop or change
            - where does change go if there isnt enough time to contain it
            - what change rates change
            - what stabilizes
            - what patterns emerge
            - what change cascades are triggered
            - what changes develop into randomness
            - what change combinations produce change rate/type/interface changes
          
          - this is a removal of the time parameter, by assigning distance to change types/rates/other metadata, so that any change is framed in terms of a base unit of change (how much change it produces, by making other objects nearer, creating other objects, and connecting with other objects)

          - this can be framed on a base of potential, because potential is a related object to change (if there is no potential, there is no change)
          - this can be framed on a base of time, because time is a related object to change (if there is no time, there is no change)



    - example of function (relationship)-based change:

      - change with respect to function/intent:
        - as change increases, does functionality/intent change and in what direction?


      - example of cause-based change:

        - change with respect to cause

        - the classic parabola of a ball's motion when thrown from the ground has two primary cause-values:
          - origin force until the peak x-value change rate, and gravity force after the peak x-value change rate
          - if the y-value starts changing more from gravity than from origin force, the gravity force becomes determining

        - additional cause values travel farther up the causal stack:
          - forces causing the emergence of gravity & origin forces are other causes
