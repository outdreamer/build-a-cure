# Core structure components

	- structures: 
	  - dimension: variable
	  - layer: parameter determining variance accretion interfaces
	  - space: dime√©sion set
	  - scale, range, spectrum
	  - group: set, potentially across dimensions (cluster of data points)
	  - list: set, potentially organized in a dimension (line of points)
	  - line: point link
	  - center: possible in a shape with symmetries
	  - corner: possible in a shape trending toward a circuit or a combination of circuit subsets (multiple lines joined at ends)
	  - tensor: vectors with common origin
	  - vector: line with restricted metadata (direction & magnitude)
	  - eigenvector: vector describing variance metadata (direction)
	  - circuit: series of lines moving at angles that allow returning to origin point
	  - network: linked points
	  - tree: network with direction
	  - stack: layers representing variables or variants within a type with values (trajectory between points in layers)
	  - topology, manifold: permutation set with symmetric properties
	  - approximation
	  - distance: variance in a similarity measure
	  - origin: starting point
	  - point: value set of dimensions
	  - angle: comparative measure of divergence between paths with same starting point
	  - direction: output attribute from input origin given a space-traversal object (line)
	  - boundary/edge/limit: extremes of resource combination generative potential
	  - inflection: metric change limit (maxima/minima of rate of change)
	  - intersection: conflict/overlap
	  - tangent: line of least nonzero interactions with another line
	  - ratio
	  - scalar: degree
	  - rate: relation of variable to another variable (putting top variable in terms of the bottom variable)
	    y/x: putting y in terms of x
	    20/4: putting 20 in terms of 4 (to make 20 you need 5 4s)
	    number/unit: putting numbers in terms of unit (integers)
	    function/combination: putting functions in terms of combinations (inputs/operations/intents)
	      (this is an example of interface standardization)
	  - cascade/path, chain, sequence, expansion, progression, series
	  - distribution

	- attributes:
	  - order 
	  - balance
	  - equivalence/similarity
	  - accuracy/fit

	- combination/contextual/conceptual structures:
	  - unit (isolatable entity)
	  - position (point)
	  - comparison (rate)
	  - combination (group)
	  - permutation
	  - interface (common attribute or attribute set)
	  - trigger
	  - trade
	  - variance
	  - pattern
	  - change
	  - flow
	  - state (combination of structure & information)
	  - filter/interface (reduce)
	  - perspective (focus)
    - symmetry

	- equivalent, alternate, substitute, opposite, inverse


## Choosing a structure

  - anything that has its own internal gravity can be modeled as a physics system, but if it has its own internal operations like how to traverse the interface network, it also has a description system

  - space math: the math of composing spaces to form spaces where operations are possible
