## Derivation/fitting methods

  I. Pattern analysis
  
    - what would the path between inputs/output be, given patterns of other paths?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given common function patterns between variables of these types/topics/ranges/other metadata?"

  II. Organization analysis

    - optimal path/distribution/states
    - what would the optimal path be, given a certain intent, object identity, & host system?
    - "what is the function linking these variables that is most efficient/involves fewest variables/involves known constants?"

  III. Causal analysis

    - given the position between these causal factors, which causal patterns are likeliest?
    - "given that a species occupies an interim position between evolution, efficiency, time, and environment, what is the likeliest causal shape linking a species with its environment?"
      - for more evolved organisms, this is a network causal shape, though species with less developed cognitive ability may have simple or uni-directional shapes with environment
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given these functions linking other adjacent generating variables/functions further up/down the causal shape"

  IV. Type analysis

    - given a known type stack progression, what is the likeliest position or extension of that stack?
    - "given that these species evolved this way, what level of variance is the missing link between them likely to have?"
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the type stacks of the function objects (dimensions, adjacent functions, identifiable shapes, etc)"

  V. System analysis

    - what known/potential inputs/outputs available in the system could build the path?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the core functions used to build this system?"
    - where are the problem types (gaps, misalignments, mismatches & conflicts)?

  VI. Intent analysis

    - what intents/directions/priorities does this path align with or could be built from?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the variable intents a, b, c and the combination intent matrix ab, bc, ca, and the possible output intents of that matrix, and similarity to output intent of y"

  VII. Variable analysis

    - includes certainty objects (known variance, metrics, change patterns) as well as uncertainty (potential/risk/opportunity) objects
    - variance accretion
    - what variance is unexplained
    - at what point does a variable become relevant to another variable interaction layer?
    - how do constants accrete between rules, like caps to keep variance from flowing in to corners or creating boundary-invalidating openings in a system/component boundary?
    - what causes variables to cascade across layers, creating fractal variables?
    - delegation of variance into systems/types/functions/variables/constants
    - what type of variable is it? (object-differentiating/identifying attribute, emergent specific/abstract property, direct function input/output)
    - how does the variable relate to other variables? (decisive metric, substitutable alternative, collinear)
    
    Example of variance type analysis (difference):
    - what is the path definitely not, based on various maximized measures of similarity?
    - what attributes & attribute sets & attribute dependency trees differ
    - what is transformation cost/potential between objects
    - what is divergence distance between generative paths for each object
    - example:
      "what is the probable function linking these variables, given that it is an adjacent transform of a square (related function type), & a distant transform of a manifold (unrelated function type)?"

  VIII. Functional analysis 

    - are there multiple directions to approach function derivation from?

      - can patterns in metadata-generators (difference generators) be used to derive the function generators (core functions)?
      - does it loop around to the start, just like lowest math/structural interface (symmetry, equivalence) loops around to highest conceptual interface (balance, power, random)?
      - the shape of the interface nexus should be a circuit feeding itself 
        (fractal inputs to itself, where input interfaces are similar in that they can both generate & be generated by the current interface)
      - this means you can select an optimal interface to start from & a direction to navigate in on the standard order of interface traversal, and an optional interface-organizing metric (like difference) to order interfaces to traverse

  IX. Conceptual analysis

    - deriving unique concepts & their relationships
    - deriving output intents of concept combinations
    - fitting concept combinations to structures
    - describing problem space, deriving strategies & perspectives in that space

  X. Structural analysis

    - identify shape: chain/stack/network/mix/layer
    - identify adjacent shapes
    - identify compression functions of shape given target dimensions
    - identify transformation functions of shape given source/target shape
    - identify alignments/symmetries/gaps/conflicts
    - when choosing between nodes & links to model objects in a network:
      node: many connections to many other objects having a similar property, like having a type in common, usually unique
      links: usually many connections between two objects at a time, having many possible variations, can be repeated

  XI. Market analysis

    - the market interface is a standard interface where resources (goods, labor, time, risk, information, expectations, theories, & stored prior labor (currency)) are traded
    - a useful new way to use this is to frame non-resource objects as resources (systems, structures, positions, paths, directions, risk chains, trade loops, markets)
    - then you can apply traditional market analysis (optimal transport) to find, for example, the optimal set of trades to change an industry's position

  XII. Interface analysis

      - determining position/trajectory on interface

      - selecting interface as best standard for comparison
        - identifying when a particular specific interface will reduce solution set across any possible host system

      - generating specific interfaces (filters) for a problem/space

      - generating full set of general interfaces (intent, concept, structure)
        - these can be generated by identifying the key differentiating factors across systems, which can be generated as combinations of objects 
          - type is a combination of attributes
          - intent is a combination of function effects
          - concept is a network of networks describing a structural concept (balance, power)
          - structure is a combination of information & rules 

      - identifying all interfaces with variance that cant be captured in other interfaces

      - interface metadata:
          - generatability/common derivable core functions with other interfaces
          - information loss
          - variance focus (what variance is exaggerated for comparison by this interface)
          - position of interface on default interface network (what distortions produce this filter/perspective from unfiltered origin)

      - interface operations:
          - intent / structure interface: assess intent interface by a standard of structure interface (which structures can simplify the intent interface)
          - function + pattern interface: merge networks of functions & patterns into one standard interface definition (input/output/logic + metadata of both objects)
          - function * pattern interface: 
            function patterns (what patterns are there in functions), pattern functions (what functions generate patterns)
            function pattern functions (what functions generate function patterns), pattern function patterns (what patterns are there in functions that generate patterns)
          - cause * type interface: 
            causal type interface (what types of cause are there), type cause interface (what causes types)
            causal type cause (what causes causal types), type cause type (what types of type causes are there)



## Extended Analysis Examples

### space analysis

- patterns in ratios between uncertainty generated by a function combination vs. uncertainty-reduction function patterns & potential (how does it hide information vs. how can information be derived)
- examine the relationship between the transformation function converting one space into another, and the transformation function converting a space's insights to another space's insights
- shapes of cause & type hierarchies relevant to different spaces
- operations invalidated within a space
- set of all possible spaces (fulfilling concept combinations) & link to the objects best described in that space whose differences are relevant to those concepts
- within a description system, there will be rules linking objects (like a shape & another shape type) that align with significant properties like symmetry that are inherent to the system
  "given any line segment, an equilateral triangle can be constructed with the segment as its base"
- core operations done on one property (length) vs. another property (angle)
- look up math on how to calculate ranges of all possible combinations of a vector set (span is one type of full combination set)
- when you do analysis of vector combinations, look at the full range of the set of transforms to achieve each core operation & try to derive a type of transform or set of patterns like related alternative type patterns
- when you analyze problem spaces (like euclidean space), examine how core operations & objects accrete in a space (multiple, shift, embed) on every interface layer
- spaces as the intersection of spectrum variables

### value analysis

- derive number type useful for a particular operation ("quaternions for 3-d rotation")
- value accretes into units (numbers)
- what accretions turn into objects that attract/hold (or provide a platform or conduit for) the most variance?
- attributes accrete into attributes ("equipollent when they are parallel, of the same length, and similarly oriented")
- vectors are probably best structure to store patterns & variable value sets
