## Derivation methods

  - these methods are analysis types that are automated with this repository

  I. Pattern analysis
  
    - what would the path between inputs/output be, given patterns of other paths?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given common function patterns between variables of these types/topics/ranges/other metadata?"

  II. Organization analysis

    - optimal path/distribution/states
    - what would the optimal path be, given a certain intent, object identity, & host system?
    - "what is the function linking these variables that is most efficient/involves fewest variables/involves known constants?"
    - identify layer to solve a problem at
    - identify key objects needed to solve a problem
    - identify structures for information

  III. Causal analysis

    - given the position between these causal factors, which causal patterns are likeliest?
    - "given that a species occupies an interim position between evolution, efficiency, time, and environment, what is the likeliest causal shape linking a species with its environment?"
      - for more evolved organisms, this is a network causal shape, though species with less developed cognitive ability may have simple or uni-directional shapes with environment
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given these functions linking other adjacent generating variables/functions further up/down the causal shape"

  IV. Type analysis

    - given a known type stack progression, what is the likeliest position or extension of that stack?
    - "given that these species evolved this way, what level of variance is the missing link between them likely to have?"
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the type stacks of the function objects (dimensions, adjacent functions, identifiable shapes, etc)"

  V. System analysis

    - what known/potential inputs/outputs available in the system could build the path?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the core functions used to build this system?"
    - where are the problem types (gaps, misalignments, mismatches & conflicts)?

  VI. Intent analysis

    - what intents/directions/priorities does this path align with or could be built from?
    - optimization is an example of a general intent, with a specific intent of 'optimizing the metric in question'
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the variable intents a, b, c and the combination intent matrix ab, bc, ca, and the possible output intents of that matrix, and similarity to output intent of y"

  VII. Variable analysis

    - includes certainty objects (known variance, metrics, change patterns) as well as uncertainty (potential/risk/opportunity) objects
    - variance accretion
    - what variance is unexplained
    - at what point does a variable become relevant to another variable interaction layer?
    - how do constants accrete between rules, like caps to keep variance from flowing in to corners or creating boundary-invalidating openings in a system/component boundary?
    - what causes variables to cascade across layers, creating fractal variables?
    - delegation of variance into systems/types/functions/variables/constants
    - what type of variable is it? (object-differentiating/identifying attribute, emergent specific/abstract property, direct function input/output)
    - how does the variable relate to other variables? (decisive metric, substitutable alternative, collinear)
    
    - example of variance type analysis (difference):
      - what is the path definitely not, based on various maximized measures of similarity?
      - what attributes & attribute sets & attribute dependency trees differ
      - what is transformation cost/potential between objects
      - what is divergence distance between generative paths for each object
      - example: "what is the probable function linking these variables, given that it is an adjacent transform of a square (related function type), & a distant transform of a manifold (unrelated function type)?"

    - example of potential-based change:
        - as potential (possible change) increases,
          - what probabilities/possibilities become possible
          - what possibilities become adjacent/distant
          
        - as potential changes, how do potential objects/types vary based on the unit of potential (possibility distance, distance between required limits & optional steps)
        - this can be framed on a base of time, because time is a related object to potential (if there is no potential, there is no time)

    - example of variance-based change:
        - changing stabilization based on randomness
        - changing interface development based on randomness
        - changing systematization based on randomness
        - as change increases, what change objects (types/rules/rates/direction) alter position/connection/distance/existence?
          - what else changes
          - what aspects of change are altered
          - what core change functions develop or change
          - where does change go if there isnt enough time to contain it
          - what change rates change
          - what stabilizes
          - what patterns emerge
          - what change cascades are triggered
          - what changes develop into randomness
          - what change combinations produce change rate/type/interface changes
        
        - this is a removal of the time parameter, by assigning distance to change types/rates/other metadata, so that any change is framed in terms of a base unit of change (how much change it produces, by making other objects nearer, creating other objects, and connecting with other objects)

        - this can be framed on a base of potential, because potential is a related object to change (if there is no potential, there is no change)
        - this can be framed on a base of time, because time is a related object to change (if there is no time, there is no change)

    - example of time-based change:
      - as time increases, what changes:
        - position
        - value (position on a dimension)
        - distance (position from a base point)
      - changing position based on time


  VIII. Functional analysis 

    - are there multiple directions to approach function derivation from?
      - can patterns in metadata-generators (difference generators) be used to derive the function generators (core functions)?
      - does it loop around to the start, just like lowest math/structural interface (symmetry, equivalence) loops around to highest conceptual interface (balance, power, random)?
      - the shape of the interface nexus should be a circuit feeding itself 
        (fractal inputs to itself, where input interfaces are similar in that they can both generate & be generated by the current interface)
      - this means you can select an optimal interface to start from & a direction to navigate in on the standard order of interface traversal, and an optional interface-organizing metric (like difference) to order interfaces to traverse

  IX. Conceptual analysis

    - deriving unique concepts & their relationships
    - deriving output intents of concept combinations
    - fitting concept combinations to structures
    - describing problem space, deriving strategies & perspectives in that space

  X. Structural analysis

    - identify shape: chain/stack/network/mix/layer
    - identify adjacent shapes
    - identify compression functions of shape given target dimensions
    - identify transformation functions of shape given source/target shape
    - identify alignments/symmetries/gaps/conflicts
    - when choosing between nodes & links to model objects in a network:
      - node: many connections to many other objects having a similar property, like having a type in common, usually unique
      - links: usually many connections between two objects at a time, having many possible variations, can be repeated

    - example of structural analysis by applying a particular structure:
      - market analysis
        - the market interface is a standard interface where resources (goods, labor, time, risk, information, expectations, theories, & stored prior labor (currency)) are traded
        - a useful new way to use this is to frame non-resource objects as resources (systems, structures, positions, paths, directions, risk chains, trade loops, markets)
        - then you can apply traditional market analysis (optimal transport) to find, for example, the optimal set of trades to change an industry's position

  XI. Interface analysis

      - determining position/trajectory on interface

      - selecting interface as best standard for comparison
        - identifying when a particular specific interface will reduce solution set across any possible host system

      - generating specific interfaces (filters) for a problem/space

      - generating full set of general interfaces (intent, concept, structure)
        - these can be generated by identifying the key differentiating factors across systems, which can be generated as combinations of objects 
          - type is a combination of attributes
          - intent is a combination of function effects
          - concept is a network of networks describing a structural concept (balance, power)
          - structure is a combination of information & rules 

      - identifying all interfaces with variance that cant be captured in other interfaces

      - interface metadata:
          - generatability/common derivable core functions with other interfaces
          - information loss
          - variance focus (what variance is exaggerated for comparison by this interface)
          - position of interface on default interface network (what distortions produce this filter/perspective from unfiltered origin)

      - interface operations:
          - intent / structure interface: assess intent interface by a standard of structure interface (which structures can simplify the intent interface)
          - function + pattern interface: merge networks of functions & patterns into one standard interface definition (input/output/logic + metadata of both objects)
          - function * pattern interface: 
            function patterns (what patterns are there in functions), pattern functions (what functions generate patterns)
            function pattern functions (what functions generate function patterns), pattern function patterns (what patterns are there in functions that generate patterns)
          - cause * type interface: 
            causal type interface (what types of cause are there), type cause interface (what causes types)
            causal type cause (what causes causal types), type cause type (what types of type causes are there)

      - interface analysis requires considering relationships like:
        - patterns in ratios between uncertainty generated by a function combination vs. uncertainty-reduction function patterns & potential (how does it hide information vs. how can information be derived)
        - the relationship between the transformation function converting one space into another, and the transformation function converting a space's objects (like insights) to another space's objects
        - valid/invalid operations in a space
        - set of all possible spaces (fulfilling concept combinations) & link to the objects best described in that space whose differences are relevant to those concepts
        - within a description system, there will be rules linking objects (like a shape & another shape type) that align with inherent system attributes like symmetry: "given any line, an equilateral triangle can be constructed with the line as its base"
        - core operations done on one attribute (length) vs. another attribute (angle)
        - how core operations & objects accrete in a space (multiple, shift, embed) on every interface layer
        - spaces as the intersection of spectrum variables
        - derive object types with attributes useful for a particular operation ("quaternions for 3-d rotation")
        - value accretion into units (integers)
        - what patterns turn into objects that attract/hold (or provide a platform or conduit for) the most variance
        - attributes accrete into aggregate/type/emergent attributes ("equipollent when they are parallel, of the same length, and similarly oriented")
