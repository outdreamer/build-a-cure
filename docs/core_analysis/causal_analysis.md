# Causal analysis

  - add causal type identification for known solutions:
    - causal types: direct/indirect, multiple/alternate, hierarchical, replaceable/unique, generatable/emergent
    - why did something work? because of its:
      - structure (which piece - the imidazole)?
      - interactions
      - other attributes
      - similarities
