# Object definitions

- this schema highlights the types & the key differentiating attributes between these objects


## Common attributes

  - core structures (points, filters, limits, boundaries)
  - core objects
  - core functions
  - minimum object identification information
  - optimization
  - completeness
  - randomness
  - reusability
  - equivalence/similarity metrics
  - abstraction: abstraction level should reduce misunderstandings while optimizing reusability
  - cooperativeness: integration capacity
  - complexity: is logic available/understandable/evaluatable
  - existing support: does it interact with existing objects
  - modularity: is it dependent on other objects, can it be swapped out & replaced seamlessly or does it have other dependencies making replacing it a complex calculation
  - delegation/trust: what can be delegated safely to this object
  - incentives: what does this object incentivize
  - assumptions
  - limits
  - types
  - state
  - potential (variance, opportunities, unused paths, adjacent states)
  - games
  - use cases
  - extreme/edge cases
  - side effects: whether it's a closed system or leaks variance
    - function side effect example:
      - before execution: pre-computing
      - during: memory access/overflow
      - after: process re-starting

  - dependencies that can build this object
  - gaps where this object can evolve
  - relationships
    - adjacent/related objects of same/different type
    - problems with adjacent objects & how those problems are generated by adjacent object metadata
    - order/position in chains & networks of this type
    - interface queries that can produce this object
    - related interface objects (problems, questions, strategies, insights, perspectives, filters, intents, concepts, patterns, structures, functions, types)
  - automation
    - resource investment (cost/time/security of sending data in a certain format or with a certain procedure)
    - understanding of host space (are the rules clear enough that we can safely automate with little expectation of variance injection)

  - types:
    - core functions
    - meta (rule-modification/generation rules)
    - attribute rules:
      - state
      - scope (use case, relevance, lifecycle, self-destruct triggers, context, range)

      - competition
      - binding/combination/cooperation/sharing
      - intersection/overlap/conflict resolution rules
      - trade
      - emergence
      - interactions with unclassified objects (that arent immediately classifiable as resources or targets)
    - assessment rules:
      - metric
      - difference (divergence, measures of distance/difference/equivalence)
      - validation/testing
      - attribute testing rules:
        - enforced/unenforced 
        - position
    - processing rules:
      - change
        - update
        - distorting (gap creation, divergence)
        - maintenance
        - adjacent objects/conversion potential (what can it be transformed into using available functions)
          - transformation within type
          - transformation to other types
      - filtering
        - finding
        - identification
        - definition
        - alternative
        - organizing
        - learning
      - matching
        - fitting (path/structure derivation, path evolution in isolation & with other factors)
        - filling (gap closing, convergence)
      - application
      - derivation
      - destruction (interacts with replacement, demand assessment, testing rules)
      - enforcement/governing (monitoring, correction, enforcement)
      - neutralizing/canceling
      - stabilizing/maintenance

      - info (problem, strategy, insight, game, perspective)
      - uncertainty/risk/potential/prediction
      - information handling (storage, versioning, replacement, merging, monitoring, indexing, communication, interpretation, processing)
      - variance (injection, leaks, combination, replacement, causal direction)
        (how does system become overwhelmed, does it have outlets to reduce variance, does it have interfaces with other systems to delegate variance)
      - solution (variance/stressor/error detection, tracing, identification & handler)
      - structure (gap, boundary, system, limit, hub, object, link, network, filter)

    - solution-metadata solution: evaluating & comparing solution metadata for solution selection
    - problem-metadata solution: evaluating problem metadata to evaluate metrics like problem-solving postponement
    - generative solution: solution that generates solutions
    - solution framework: provides starting point & structures for solutions to be built in/with
    - problem decomposer: solution that reduces a problem's root causative (as opposed to just varying) parameters
    - solution automator: solution that automates solutions of a type
    - interim solution: clearly suboptimal solution while optimal alternative is built
    - solution query constructor: solution that builds new solutions out of known solution types (existing structural solutions or core functions)
    - structure-finding solution: solution that assigns a structure to information
    - structure-fitting solution: solution that matches the gaps/limits in a problem structure to neutralize them

- concept

  - definition: set of unique objects remaining once objects from other spaces have their context & contradictory attributes removed

    - example: power is the object left when objects implementing it
    
      - resources => energy => input => potential) have their context removed, navigating up the abstraction stack from:
        - the info layer (resources & energy), removing their contextual attributes/rules
        - to the abstract structural layer (input)
        - to the abstract layer (potential, which is a related concept of power)
      - so that the final object is defined in terms of other abstract objects on the top layer
