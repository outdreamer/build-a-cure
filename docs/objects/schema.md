# Object definitions

- this schema highlights the types & the key differentiating attributes between these objects


## Common attributes

  - core structures (points, filters, limits, boundaries)
  - core objects
  - core functions
  - optimization
  - completeness
  - reusability
  - abstraction: abstraction level should reduce misunderstandings while optimizing reusability
  - cooperativeness: integration capacity
  - complexity: is logic available/understandable/evaluatable
  - existing support: does it interact with existing objects
  - modularity: is it dependent on other objects, can it be swapped out & replaced seamlessly or does it have other dependencies making replacing it a complex calculation
  - delegation/trust: what can be delegated safely to this object
  - incentives: what does this object incentivize
  - assumptions
  - limits
  - types
  - state
  - side effects (closed system or leaks variance)
  - dependencies that can build this object
  - gaps where this object can evolve
  - relationships
    - adjacent/related objects of same/different type
    - problems with adjacent objects & how those problems are generated by adjacent object metadata
    - order/position in chains & networks of this type
    - interface queries that can produce this object
    - related interface objects (problems, questions, strategies, insights, perspectives, filters, intents, concepts, patterns, structures, functions, types)
  - automation
    - resource investment (cost/time/security of sending data in a certain format or with a certain procedure)
    - understanding of host space (are the rules clear enough that we can safely automate with little expectation of variance injection)
  - examples
  - errors
    - inefficiencies


## Common functions

  - core
  - metadata
  - change
    - update
  - limit
      - scope limit (use case, context, range)
      - boundary limits
  - automation
  - dependency
    - assumption/expectation
    - context
    - standards/protocols


## Objects

- function
  - definition: a set of inputs, a list of rules or rule lists (logic tree) applied to the input set, an output set created by changes to the input set, and side effects from execution
    - side effect examples: 
      - before execution: pre-computing
      - during: memory access/overflow
      - after: process re-starting

    - solution-metadata solution: evaluating & comparing solution metadata for solution selection
    - problem-metadata solution: evaluating problem metadata to evaluate metrics like problem-solving postponement
    - generative solution: solution that generates solutions
    - solution framework: provides starting point & structures for solutions to be built in/with
    - problem decomposer: solution that reduces a problem's root causative (as opposed to just varying) parameters
    - solution automator: solution that automates solutions of a type
    - interim solution: clearly suboptimal solution while optimal alternative is built
    - solution query constructor: solution that builds new solutions out of known solution types (existing structural solutions or core functions)
    - structure-finding solution: solution that assigns a structure to information
    - structure-fitting solution: solution that matches the gaps/limits in a problem structure to neutralize them
