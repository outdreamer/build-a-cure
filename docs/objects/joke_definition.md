## Joke

### Definition

#### Attributes

I. difference

1. silliness (extreme difference in realism)

- lack of correct priority distribution (extreme un/importance attached to extremely un/important things - high/low stakes)

- lack of logic (unconnected assumptions, jumping to conclusions, logical fallacies)

- lack of probability (categorizing highly unrealistic assertions as fact, categorizing facts as opinions, categorizing product reviews as terrorism)

- lack of knowledge (implying such a huge lack of information that its silly)

2. surprise

- subversion of expectations (diverging vectors)

- alternate meanings (alternate routes)

3. relevance (circular or other shapes of intersections)

- can provide surprise in the joke by being relevant to prior implication of the joke in a surprising way

II. layers (multiple combinations of other attributes in joke)

- example:
- a joke can subvert expectations of a prior implication, or subvert expectations of the relevance of a prior implication to add another layer

III. point (implication of joke)

- a joke can have an underlying point, such as "not all stereotypes are true", or "applying the idea of stereotypes to a dog is funny because dogs cant choose their behavior so the idea of them having stereotypes to overcome is comical"

IV. brevity

- short jokes are often more difficult to construct but can be more powerful in surprise impact

V. route

- the route to a joke may add to the surprise of the joke

- example: 
- rather than just applying a standard formula like:
"replace object with a sillier object" ("my aunt thinks she's my mother" => "my aunt thinks she's my god/accountant/stylist")

you can add distortions to this standard formula by navigating through other objects first:
"replace object with an object that defeats the purpose of a prior object in a surprising way that makes a silly point"

- "my dog thinks shes my mom" => "my dog thinks she's my chew toy, im always provoking her into a fight with annoying impressions of politicians despite her repeatedly turning the other cheek in peaceful protest, except when she takes all the persecution out on plastic pikachu, continuing the unending cycle of war"

- "my dog thinks shes my best friend" => "my dog thinks she's my enemy and she's right because a real best friend wouldnt have shinier hair than you without pantene pro-v"

#### Rules

- must be tied to reality in some way
- must have some nonzero non-real ratio
- must have at least one identifying joke attribute (difference attributes (silliness, surprise, relevance), or another joke attribute) with non-standard value different from a normal sentence

#### Types

- topic (any object forming expectations, such as social group dynamics, norms, religious tenets, assumptions, stereotypes, roles, etc)
- style (meta-humor, comedian's comedy, dark humor, sarcasm, high brow, raunchy)
- attribute (contextual, political, self-aware, self-referential, fourth-wall breaking, joke commentary)

#### Common joke components/functions

1. varying value on silliness spectrum:

- factual (definitely real): cats hate mice
- probable: cats hate things that run away
- not likely: cats hate things that run fast
- unlikely: cats hate things that move on wheels
- extremely unlikely: cats hate people in wheelchairs (the disabled)
- possible: cats hate people who make money move
- impossible: cats hate Jesus Christ, who created physics

2. silly divergence in expectations

- "a Mexican and a Jew walk into a bar. The Jew asks the Mexican if he's going to order a margarita. "What you think all Mexicans drink margaritas, ese?" They start fighting, and the Jew accidentally lands a punch on the Mexican, who bleeds a clear liquid that catches fire from a nearby drink. "Ay! Dios mio!" squealed the Mexican. "Watch your fists, holmes - don't you know Mexicans bleed tequila, wey? Not next to the flaming jello shots, amigo!" 
- the expectation is that the joke will imply the Jew was being racist, but it ends up implying the opposite of that expectation
- another layer of comedy comes from the idea of a Jew being the oppressor of another race, which has some historical context lending silliness to that implication

3. surprising relevance

I. relevance circle

- relevance circles can be funny because they can add a layer of surprise - connecting things that wouldnt normally be connected

- "the prison guard reminded the convicts that they could be let out early for good behavior, instead of playing dead when it was time to take their medicine, and only peeing on purebred dogs on the basketball court" 
- has prison gang (purebred/race supremacist) relevance tied to initial implication of prison guard-criminal dynamic

II. intersection of alternate meaning waves

- "the computer disk's memory was corrupted, so it didnt recognize its mother John McAfee and thought he was trying to kill it with antivirus medication, to prevent it from exploiting browser caches for personal gain"

- has two intersection points of alternate meaning waves for "memory" & "corruption"

1. memory corruption => amnesia

2. memory corruption => paranoia of being caught in corrupt, exploitative transactions, related to memory management

- also has a relevance circle, tying the end implication "corrupt exploitative memory management" to the first implication "memory was corrupted", and the middle implication "paranoid amnesia"

III. defeating the purpose

- defeating the purpose of a prior implication in the joke (subversion of expectations, in the form of contradicting relevance of prior implication)

- finding the silliest possible position for an object to occupy, given what the object is

- "the oreo CEO submitting a flavor suggestion in their next flavor contest"
- the implication that "they have no other power to influence that decision" defeats the purpose of "being a CEO"

- irony: 

- reversal/perversion of intent & relevant implication

- framing "bias based on unchosen attributes" (racism, gender bias) as an "unchosen attribute":
    
- example: "racism/gender bias is passed on genetically"
  intent: "persecution is racist", implication: "racists are persecuted"

- example: "the tiger conservationist was eaten by a tiger"
  intent: "protecting tigers", implication: "protecting themselves from tigers"

IV. topical for recent trends

- many jokes, like insights, have a time limit of relevance, and are most powerful when new, articulating a previously unarticulated trend that many were feeling was absurd, but none had captured with language
- some classic jokes retain power because theyre insightful to most people who encounter them, and not incorporated in the culture as a default assumption yet

4. comical difference

- comical differences can be between any object (assumption, definition, adjacent object, implication, topic, type, layer, attribute, rule, etc) in the joke and any other object, if there is an expectation for those objects to distort in the first place

- examples:

- between one sentence & the next: 
"I told my mom I was going to run some errands, so I dog-walked my neighbor."

- between style & content: 
"Mariah Carey believes George Foreman grills to be a relatable & timeless reference. In this essay I will" (style: serious essay writing, content: silly pop music)

- assumption taken to an exaggerated extreme version of itself:
"Yeah friends are cool but ... you ever caught something you dropped before it reached the ground?"
(yes it feels good, but this is an extreme exaggeration of how good it feels)

- extreme realism of a silly assumption
"officer wishbone has requested time-off to deal with the loss of his wife, squeaky pikachu toy"
(silly assumption: "dog is a police officer", extreme realism: "depression after loss of a loved one, which for a dog might be a squeaky toy")

- framing something very unlikely as extremely obvious assumption
"I took the dog to the barber with me, because it wasnt fair that I got to change my hair style every week. Besides, if I didnt take her to the barber, someone else would cut her hair while I wasnt being vigilant, you have to be careful"

- mad libs: replacing objects or verb in a normal sentence with silly versions
normal sentence: "library study buddy oversold their history class skills"
silly sentence: "library study buddy oversold their quiet-chip-eating skills"

- lists of unrelated things (mixing abstraction level, topic, etc)
"the main reason I was late is not just traffic but also grandma gangs, highway lane-switching personal dramas, the Jews who run the media, manipulative billboard copywriters, bank robber getaway chases, Trent Reznor, the liberal media, and the Office franchise making everyone slower on the highway because theyre busy arguing about who Michael should have ended up with instead of focusing on the road"

- finding silly possibilities (aim for unlikely rather than extremely silly or extremely realistic, because unlikeliness is more surprising, subtler, & difficult to find)

- mixing extremely different social abstractions (types, identities, positions, relationships, histories, conceptual objects like assumptions/priorities) is often comical because norms & differences between social groups are often silly or pointless or insignificant, so pretending they're important differences is comical

- "everyone assumes white people cause all of society's problems, and they're partially right, because some goths are white, and so are some Jews, and so are some clowns"

- a combination of an assumption & an illogically concluded assumption (misunderstanding) to generate extreme silliness (stupidity):
"the stadium rules dont say 'dont feed the players' so that means they want us to throw popcorn at them"

- juxtaposition of big ego/high stakes with trivial/minor details to generate pettiness:
"I called the cops because no one complimented my Xmas sweater"

- assuming the insanity/stupidity of an agent to generate silliness
"is there a mental institution nearby with a recent break-out who would like to speak with you?"

- acting the role of straight enforcer on a chaotic generator of rule-breaking to generate comical difference, such as framing "regulating others' lack of self-awareness of their misunderstandings" as a "need" rather than an "option", which is how it would normally be classified

"I can recommend a good therapist, if you genuinely need to keep talking about your dog's unwillingness to match outfits with you"

- sarcastically agreeing with silly statements as if they're true

- humoring an insane person (where the insane person is the silliness generator, and the contrast between their beliefs & reality is the key difference - related to sarcasm)
"I can see why you thought wearing a hijab would make you popular with Muslims, rather than peaceably co-existing with them, which wasnt getting you any personal attention, which is specifically forbidden in the Quran"

- huge cognitive & semantic distance between previous & current sentence to generate surprise:
"yeah I could have taken those bullies - to church, but I didnt have my church bus pass on me because I keep it in my respect-for-Jesus/sinning pants"



### Consensus by joke

- using 'friendly fire' jokes to build consensus & inspire confrontation of ridiculous beliefs
- one way to get people on your side is being extra decent when they expect you to fight them
- honesty is also important - find a way to make the truth funny, assuming the worst is true & building jokes on that


#### Friendly fire humor


#### Gun Laws

This means instead of accusing republicans of killing people with their 'ignorance is bliss' approach to guns, you need to use humor to make your points in a way that doesnt antagonize them

In that case an example would mean finding a democrat killed by guns and then you could say 
- 'ok that guy deserved it, but in general i dont like guns'

And build a joke on top of that like 
- 'maybe we could have a legal one-person sacrifice once every year and the Garys of the world would be hunted & you all could get out all your gun aggression on that person'

And make it clear youre joking - that would get pro-gun people on your side even without committing to that kind of policy, and anyone who objects just looks stupid for not getting that its a joke. This makes it possible for them to confront the extreme negative possibilities of their own beliefs (that some innocent person who could be them someday gets murdered by a gun) in an honest way that doesnt make them hate you bc you did it in a funny way - it's partly the improv method of 'yes and' but in a way that makes your original point, mixed with their actual beliefs, taken to a comical extreme.


#### Abortion

On stuff like abortion you can ask them for scientific proof like:
- 'we should make babies sign a contract or pass a test proving that theyre not going to torture their parents by being failures or asking for stuff all the time or prove that they came from the holy dimension instead of hell and that they arent possessed by the devil & arent the antichrist, or else they have to get in the dumpster'
- 'we should have a return policy on babies if you find out theyre the antichrist or the second coming of jesus which would be a lot'

If theyre religious you can do the friendly fire humor again:
- 'the only reason I didnt get an abortion was I didnt want Jesus looking in there to check me for virtuous behavior' that mixes their beliefs with some ridiculousness that makes your original point and doesnt make them feel bad


#### Medical Care

- 'we should make a deal with doctors that they get to kill their most annoying patient once a year if they make a big contribution to science'
- 'if patients want medical care without the new disability of crippling debt, they should have to prove that theyre below a certain level of annoying'
- 'if patients want to keep complaining about bills & request unnecessary, they can pay for their doctors' therapy'
- 'patients can be their own doctors by shooting off the bacteria with their medical rifles'
- 'patients only get science if theyre willing to protect gun rights with their lives'
- 'people who get old & acquire an infestation of legal teams arent mentally strong enough to will their medical problems such as aging & legal staff away'
- 'republicans are hobbits & they need our charity to find a cure'
- 'republicans hate scientists bc they would figure out they were hobbits'


#### Basic Income

- 'imagine the robot industry innovations if Trump had had basic income'
- 'Trumps painting of himself as a ripped superhero would be real if he had had basic income'
- 'we would be able to hire a 24/7 security team to chase Trump off the golf course if there was basic income bc people would volunteer for that if they didnt have to worry about the basics'


### Truth humor

- assume that:
	- everyone wants to kill you
	- everyone is evil
	- everyone is lying
	- everyone is competing

- and then make it funny:

	- homicidal urges
		- 'ill pitch in on the casket if you promise to wait until we pass this bill to hire a hitman'

	- ubiquitous evil
		- 'you can throw me to the rednecks once we take away their guns & ill fight them with a fistfight like a lady would'

	- eternal lies
		- 'i know by "lets take away the guns" you really mean "lets experiment on citizens after they dont have guns"'

	- competing
		- petty humor (Larry David style, suspicious & cares about stupid low-stakes things)
