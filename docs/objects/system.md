# System

	- definition: set of rules & objects, usually with a boundary unless rules emerge as a boundary

	- attributes:
		- can interact with multiple systems/problem/solution spaces
		- cooperation/communication/binding sites (openings in system)

	- structures:
		- core system structures: network, nodes, links, filters, & boundary
		- layers
		- vertices 
			- core points (corrollary of core functions)
			- sets of generating functions/objects/attributes/constants/types that determine the system
			- for example, the center is a vertex of a circle
		- hubs
		- gaps
		- limits (dependencies/incentives/intents/paradoxes)

	- relationships:
		- relevant interfaces & interface trajectories
		- applicable spaces              

	- functions

	- examples:

		- for a problem space of solving a memory storage problem, these can be relevant systems:
			
			- software/hardware evolution
				- open source
				- automation patterns
				- platforms/frameworks
				- marketplaces
				- security
				- full tech stack
				- algorithms
				- data structures
				- memory optimization
				- computation (space/time tradeoff, parallel execution, pre-computation, queuing)

			- chemistry: materials science

			- physics: electricity
