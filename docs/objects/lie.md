# Lie


	To spot a lie, you need to analyze every statement as follows:
		
		1. analyze the statement metadata:
			- inputs (like a lying habit)
			- outputs (like side effects)
		
		2. inputs: analyze whether those inputs might apply (might they be lying out of habit, like a pathological liar, rather than for a specific intent)
			- check if those inputs apply to the speaker (have they said other lies for no reason)
				- analyze whether the statement exists in isolation or is determined by the context, without inputs/outputs like reasons to say it (they said it bc its an expected or default response in the conversation, not because they really mean it)
		
		3. outputs: analyze how those outputs could benefit the speaker (derive intents, as in reasons to make the statement)
			
			- reasons to say something include: 
				'bc its true', 'bc its polite', 'bc its random', 'bc they mean it', 'to get a reaction' (trolling), 'end a conversation', 'amuse themselves', 'undermine you', 'to get stuff (attention, compliments, favors)', 'bc they saw someone else say it on tv/social circle and saw that person get rewards', 'bc its fun to say', 'to make conversation/keep the conversation going', 'to make a point', 'to trigger other conversations/questions/assumptions/conclusions/jokes/other info objects'

			- check if those intents apply to the speaker (do they have that intent, would the output (such as your reaction) benefit them in some way, like making them feel free/powerful/good/like they control you, to get stuff, to seem good in some way)
			
				- a quick insight path in a question format would be: "how would my default reaction to this statement benefit them?"

				- alternatively you can generate what reactions a particular statement would incentivize, if you dont have that default reaction theyre aiming for, in order to derive which reactions theyre aiming for

	In order to generate a lie, you need to create an alignment between some attribute/object/function that is not accurate, meaningful, or relevant (a false appearance of truth). You can identify lying opportunities as the set of all false similarities in a system (malicious intents that look virtuous, behaviors that seem to fulfill the victim's interests until the error is irreversible, claims that align with feelings but not facts or facts but not logic or logic but not potential, false excuses that have something in common with legitimate behavior, planned lack of attention or regulation as an opportunity for malicious behavior, etc). You can also identify lie trajectories that have the potential to be or become true (unprovable ethical claims, unmeasurable states without information stored, ambiguities in similarities), or are moving in the direction of being true (lack of empathy driving a behavior that is converted to empathy because of the behavior) across states.

## Lie metadata

    Intent (also purpose, motivation, or goal): what someone intends to achieve with this lie
    Priorities: what the liar values most
    Perspective: what ethical perspective are they using to justify this lie — karma, logic, or maybe vigilante justice?
	State of mind: this includes moods & feelings like being nervous or tired or focusing on a certain thing, at the time of the event they’re lying about
	State of information: what information in the form of memories the liar possessed, at the time of the event they’re lying about
	Context: how should this lie be delivered — after a certain sentence, in a certain place, etc

	Audience: who is this lie aimed at?
	Length: how long should this lie work? when should it be delivered
	Robustness: what types of scrutiny should this lie be able to sustain?
	Time: including event time, lie construction time, lie delivery time, lie correction time, lie proving time; these are all relevant moments to consider when deciding whether to re-evaluate the components of the lie
	Scope: is this lie true in certain contexts, maybe locally true while globally false?
	Degree of truth: every lie is based on some true information; this metric describes how much of this information made it into the final version of the lie

## Lie Type Examples:

1. Factual lie
- misrepresenting an object's type, attributes, or attribute values
- misrepresenting a relationship between objects

2. Lie of personal attribute
- virtue-signaling to falsely indicate you have a virtue attribute

3. Lie of action/reaction/mannerism
- fake approval (smiling, nodding, laughing)
- adopting the stereotypical mannerisms of a stereotyped group (ie, gender)

4. Lie of logic
- logical fallacies

5. Speech patterns to trigger conclusions
- Leading question to push people to a conclusion
- Speaking in balanced tones to communicate balanced logic

6. Lie of association
- Repeating a phrase so often with another phrase that they become falsely associated

7. Lie of unprovable feelings:
- False pity/concern: 'Im worried about them' (did they take action to help them?)
- False sincerity: 'I mean it'
- False regret/apologies

8. Lies of possibility/potential
- 'I could, I just dont want to' (they can make themselves want to & didnt?)

9. Lies of authority/permission
- 'the government of feelings grants you permission to violate the laws made by the government of this country'

10. Lies of authoritative info source (intuition/intelligence/gossip)
- 'trust me/I can tell/I just know/I heard/my intuition tells me'

11. Lies of unprovable concepts (motivations, thoughts, priorities, intentions, plans, knowledge)
- 'this person has these intentions, motivations, & plans'

12. Lies of convenient false conclusion/implication/assumption: 
- 'this person said X, which means Y'

13. Lies of fairness
- 'they deserve X, bc of my system of fairness'

14. Lies of implication
- 'this person said X, which implies Y'

15. Lies of cause/fault/control
- 'they didnt stop me, so its their fault'

16. Lies of relevance
- 'they're X, so their argument is faulty'

Intention: Saying they had a particular intention, when they didn’t. Example: “I wanted to help, but there was no way for me to help.”

State of mind: saying that a state of mind exerted control over their actions when it didn’t, like being distracted or not paying attention. Example: “I was thinking about my homework so I couldn’t focus on driving the car.”

State of information: saying they didn’t have all the information to do the right thing, when they did. Example: “I would have been nice to her, but I didn’t know she deserved it”, “I didn’t know that would hurt anyone.”, “She needs to prove herself more to earn the same things the men get automatically — if she passes the next test, then I’ll respect her.”

Experience: saying they experienced something a particular way, when they didn’t. Example: “That was fun”, “I remember that being someone else’s fault, not mine”, “I consented to that”

Omission: leaving out crucial details to distort a situation. Example: someone saying “The cat is on a diet” when the damn rascal simply forgot to feed her

Politeness: we’re all familiar with this type, which is a lie people tell to be polite. I’m sure your brain is summoning so many examples of this from all the times you’ve been polite that I will happily defer to your brain on this one.

Reduce Conversation Time: a lie with the sole purpose of ending the conversation. Example: “I have to go run an errand”

Missing Information: saying that we know something, when we don’t. This type of lie includes promises, which are statements asserting that something will happen in the future, which we cannot know for sure. Example: “I’ll solve that problem tomorrow”

Unprovably False: a broad category of lies that involve any case where a lie cannot be proved false, such as lies of intention or experience, which we cannot prove false because we don’t have brain monitoring tools of the caliber necessary to identify intentions in the brain. If a lie of Missing Information turns out to be false, it is also an Unprovably False type of lie. Example: “I intended to do the right thing, but I couldn’t”, “I would have done the right thing, but you didn’t tell me this was important to you”

Fault: where the liar doesn’t deny that something wrong happened, but assigns the blame to someone else. Example: “They told me to be mean to her, so it’s their fault, not my fault for trusting them.”

Protective: saying someone is worse than they are, to make someone feel better or guard against a dangerous level of attention from insecure zombies. Example: “I’m not that good, anyone could do this if they practiced enough.”

Virtue Signaling: saying something for the sole purpose of demonstrating a virtue. Example: “I like comic books” to signal the virtue of being cool, “I’m a democrat” to signal the virtue of caring about people, etc.

Wishful Thinking: saying someone is capable of more than they are. The difference between this and positive thinking is that these kind of lies are not capable of being true, now or in future. Also known as a lie of potential, this lie falls apart under the most basic testing, to the point where you usually don’t have to test it in the real world — testing it in your imagination is enough to know it’s false. Example: “I could fly unaided by technology just by believing I can”. As we know, lies can distort the social laws governing us, but not physical laws. And why would you want to? Flying is nowhere near as cool as building technology. This leads me to the next lie type, which is:

Opinion as Fact: The opinion ‘flying is nowhere near as cool as building technology’ is not a factual statement, but I made it sound like one by being so declarative and assertive. You’ll encounter this a lot on the ‘news’, which is essentially a bunch of highly paid people stating their opinions as facts — the ‘highly paid’ part comes from whether their opinions represent the beliefs of a big enough audience to fetch decent ad money.

Implied Lie: this is a slightly subtler lie than the others, and involves a lie of the implication of a message, rather than a lie of the message itself. This type of lie includes question traps, which lead people to say or believe things by false implications.

Example: “Would you trust this politician to babysit your kids?” is a leading question trap resplendent with emotional language that makes your audience immediately distrust that politician. The implication is that you can’t trust the politician — even though it looks like the liar is just innocently asking a question. Part of the problem with this is that it’s not relevant to the politician’s purpose or role; she’s there to protect the national interests of the citizenry, not babysit — so implying that she’s there to babysit is irrelevant, and this takes us into the domain of logical fallacies.

A more neutral alternative would be: “Is this politician likely to vote a certain way on this issue, given her voting history?” The only implication of that is that the ‘certain way’ contradicts her past voting history, so you’re questioning the likelihood of her voting that way. That is a legitimate implication, rather than a false one.
