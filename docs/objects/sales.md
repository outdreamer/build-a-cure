- persuasion & sales/lying automation

      - types

        - no sell: 'they dont need you or your purchase, you need them'

        - trick sell: involves a lie of some sort, like a logical fallacy

          - lie of omission: not correcting someone
          - logical fallacy: slippery slope

        - hard sell: portraying a non-essential product as essential

        - personal manipulations like:
            - flirting
            - similarity
            - compliments
            - understanding/sympathy
            - giving them a chance/benefit of the doubt
            - trust
            - extended examples: 
              - setting a trap so they break something then forgiving them
              - stories to demonstrate their personhood & trigger your social urges to give them more opportunities to connect

      - attributes

        - association
          - associate the product with things they like or that everyone likes
          - includes attributes like a personality trait (only adventurous people buy it)

        - relatability
          - analogies based on their life or with terms they understand, given the information theyve told you or common information

        - distortion
          - example: portraying a likelihood that is non-extreme as extreme

      - functions

        - add filler speech associated with good communicators
          - checking their understanding
          - repetition

        - social skills

      - state

        - have a concept of state (dont assume theyre in the same state as before or cant change their state)

        - emotional state
          - fear of a negative event that the product could prevent
          - confused or thinking or busy, other mental states than emotions than can influence sales
          - jokes to make you laugh so youre in a generous mood

        - adjacent to an invalidating state (soon wont need the product)

      - as a neural network, persuasion algorithms can be used to 'sell' a different label to a network


- mental process algorithms

  - empathy nn algorithm

    - start from positions: 
      - worst case scenarios related to attacks (planning an attack)
      - emotional sources triggering attacks (fears, etc)
      - intents related to attacks (get resources)
      - causes of attacks (irrational thinking)
      - strategies of attacks (false correlation, false sense of security, surprise)
      - strategies to prevent attacks ('never be surprised', 'assume the worst')
      - asymmetries leading to different perspectives (such as "lack of resources like information, understanding or concepts (no concept of 'fair fight', 'attack first', etc)")
      - reasoning to fulfill intents (there's usually a reason to take an action that they think will fulfill an intent)
      - alternatives to reasoning, including politeness, lack of thought, and other reasons for a decision

    - starting from all the positions & actions that have efficiencies & reasons to move the way they do or in the direction they do is a good starting point once those are identified
    - this will reduce the solution space to identify likely starting points, intents, actions, functions, and attributes, rather than having to check them all

  - confusion nn: algorithm that tries to trick a network into thinking a set of labels is correct, and the algorithm either:

      - optimizes for confusion/ambiguity for obfuscation, or for deriving differentiation methods (patterns of difference) between conflated types
      - tries to identify confusion distortions as a way to implement a common sense algorithm (if it fulfills confusion metrics, its unlikely to fit with a common sense system)

  - creativity nn: algorithm that mimics creativity in thinking of alternate possibilities/explanations
      - switch structure, abstraction, type, attribute, function, direction (like how random jokes come from a totally different direction but still have an intersection)

  - efficiency nn: algorithm with efficiency optimizations, like distributed starting points for a search through weight patterns/sets that signal to the others when they find efficiencies like automatically aligned intents or similar structures

  - emotion nn: algorithm with a concept of emotion built in, so that different modes of traversing a network can be switched between as needed 
      - anger for organizing resources (when noise is detected or when aggregating signals)
      - fear/disgust for identifying threats, joy for prioritizing & identifying rewards (to the prediction function accuracy)

  - understanding nn:

    - the typical route of understanding may take the form of 'example - attributes/functions/object - generalization - concepts - faq & missing information', which can be optimized by starting with concepts first and descending to structural layers with n-degree jumps, an iterative loop or wave to tie structures found to concepts identified, abstract questions forming sub-components of the query, selecting & applying tests/filters, then generating info objects like examples to fill that structure

    - the info object network can be used to format information & design the query sequence across info objects/formats/types

    - this is an implementation of insight paths in the info object network (misconceptions, fallacies, false similarities (metaphors), etc)

    - occasionally a non-standard system may be more useful than a standardized system to store & fit information (temporary/granular intents like communicating to a specific audience or demonstrating a proof of concept or giving an example or metaphor that doesnt need to be accurate)
  
  - these mental processes can be used in different positions, for different functions:
      
      - empathy
        - deriving starting point & other core objects like intent functions, priority attributes, etc

      - stereotype
        - fitting objects without the need for accuracy (like when mining structural similarities for pattern gains)

      - creativity
        - new paths/combinations
        - alternate paths/combinations

      - confusion
        - obfuscation
        - ambiguity
        - differentiation
        - deriving patterns (in order to resolve the point of confusion, they have to figure out why & how two types might differ & test distortion patterns to get to those differences)
      
      - persuasion: 
        
        - 'get resources without earning them' (get funds for investment in another product or a future version of the product)
          - the structural translation of this is: 'move to a target position without the aligning action to propel the move'
        
        - 'get someone to act against their own interests' (get funds for investment in another product)
          - the structural translation of this is: 'move to a target position without the aligning self-interested intent to motivate the move'

        - 'get someone to match their behavior to their own interests' (the product is good for them but they dont automatically seek it out)
          - structural translation: 'move to a target position by changing the intent direction toward the beneficial resource' (to prioritize doing whats good for them)
        
        - 'get someone to align their interests with the group' (the product is good for humanity, like free trade or other products with distributed benefits)
