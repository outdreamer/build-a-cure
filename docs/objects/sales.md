- persuasion & sales/lying automation

      - types

        - no sell: 'they dont need you or your purchase, you need them'

        - trick sell: involves a lie of some sort, like a logical fallacy

          - lie of omission: not correcting someone
          - logical fallacy: slippery slope

        - hard sell: portraying a non-essential product as essential

        - personal manipulations like:
            - flirting
            - similarity
            - compliments
            - understanding/sympathy
            - giving them a chance/benefit of the doubt
            - trust
            - extended examples: 
              - setting a trap so they break something then forgiving them
              - stories to demonstrate their personhood & trigger your social urges to give them more opportunities to connect

      - attributes

        - association
          - associate the product with things they like or that everyone likes
          - includes attributes like a personality trait (only adventurous people buy it)

        - relatability
          - analogies based on their life or with terms they understand, given the information theyve told you or common information

        - distortion
          - example: portraying a likelihood that is non-extreme as extreme

      - functions

        - add filler speech associated with good communicators
          - checking their understanding
          - repetition

        - social skills

          - objects

            - info objects (lie, joke, strategy, perspective, plan, argument)

            - advanced info objects (info object combinations)
              - question traps
              - logical fallacy
              - polite lie
              - public apology
              - argument joke (joke to make an embedded point)

          - concepts

            - context (system)
              - actions have different meaning in different contexts and shouldnt be separated from context

            - consent (intent)
              - consent is a process and should be earned iteratively & repeatedly communicated & checked

            - communication
              - communication is a default mechanism to resolve/prevent conflicts like imbalances

            - exploitation
              - everyone can expect a reasonable degree of exploitation without an organized entity like government or understanding enforcing fair distribution, but it should be used as a last resort method rather than a default

            - competition
              - there are a number of fair fight opportunities that can resolve optimization questions better than other methods than competition

            - expectations
              - expectations influence actions & should be distributed just like problems are

            - trust (delegation)
              - trust should be default in low-risk situations but earned after, and earned in high-risk situations

            - responsibility (distribution)
              - responsibility should be distributed by ability & intent

            - fairness (balance)
              - everyone has limitations and similar things can be expected of them (expectations of thinking time, rule-adherence, etc)

            - intent
              - different actions can have similar intents & vice versa (different actions can have the same intent, and the same actions can have different intents)

            - state, including emotional, mental, physiological, psychological
              - different states can produce similarities in behavior

            - potential (function)
              - different people have different mental functions available to them 

            - perspective
              - different people have different perspectives (filter that focuses on certain information, with certain priorities & strategies to fulfill them)

          - emotion
            - use logic to counteract emotions
            - think before acting
            - use emotions as a tool
            - recognize that other people may not have had time or other resources to develop control of their emotions & may need other tools or resources to get to the level they need to be

          - assumptions/expectations
            - assume as little as possible while expecting the best (they're busy, not stupid)
            - assume they have problems you cant see
            - expect nothing from other people you cant do yourself
            - find a reason to cooperate/sympathize before finding a reason to compete/condemn in case the sympathy is earned
            - assume the best by default (benefit of the doubt, or trust)
            - respect other people's independence/complexity/intelligence/potential by default
            - assume they've thought of everything or know everything or can figure out everything, but are in a mental state everyone has at some point (confused, grieving, in a hurry, distracted)
            - assume negative intents first and find a way to make those beneficial to them or acceptable ('its ok if everyone doesnt want to do charity, but find a way to make it fun/profitable/otherwise beneficial to them, or find a way to make it acceptable to not want to, so they dont feel pressure, bc pressure to do the right thing makes it less likely')
            - assume if theyre privileged in some way that other people already created problems for them (incels probably already attacked them if theyre attractive) so dont do the same thing if avoidable

          - responsibility
            - dont create problems you cant fix
            - check if people want to fix a problem before trying to help them fix it
            - assign responsibility in a fair way
            - recognize the luck in your life (had time to focus on something)
            - dont try to force other people to do anything, but give them options to do the right thing (communicate useful insights of critical thinking if theyre not using it, etc)
            - change your behavior with new contradictory information of your prior decision rules
            - recognize that not everyone has time or need to develop intelligence
            - recognize that other people have the ability to think of the points youre making but may have reasons or lack of resources explaining why they didnt
            - recognize the incentives of other people's positions & that most people would respond to those incentives
            - recognize the pressures put on other people & acknowledge it (men are pressured to do all the work)
            - recognize that people cant fulfill every metric all the time & have to allocate resources like everyone else
            - recognize that a mistake may not be lack of intelligence or intent to harm but rather a lack of focus or intentional thinking
            - recognize when youre abusing your luck or power (not everyone knows joke attributes/functions, but it doesnt mean they cant be funny or learn to be funny)
            - recognize that other people's agency means they also have the choice to be bad & the responsibility to change what they want if they want to hurt innocent people or harm society
            - help other people get things right where possible, rather than setting traps or forcing them into traps like rigged intelligence/character/hazing tests that are impossible to pass to get power trip/humiliation out of them
            - give people credit for their work where possible
            - help reduce other people's work where possible by identifying automation opportunities, or otherwise contributing to automation of their work
            - recognize that people have limits and dont push them past those limits

          - intent

            - recognize common intents (complaining, dodging blame, getting compliments) and in what positions they are likely to apply (people avoiding work, people covering mistakes, insecure people)
            - recognize when common intents dont apply & be extra cautious until you can identify new intent combinations, mental models, or other decision rules/metrics
            - recognize common harmful intents & avoid those as a first priority
            - have a neutralizing joke or comment ready to prevent any foreseeable negative situations (if someone is about to pressure you to do something, have a comment ready that is polite or neutral to deflect it in a way that doesnt make them feel rejected or otherwise triggers their emotions)
            - dont obviously respond to harmful intents if they are too emotionally or otherwise bankrupt to handle it (dont clearly be commenting on/responding to incels if youre talking to one and its not necessary to say anything about them)
            - recognize when there are clear incentives and try to avoid them if they dont benefit anyone or just benefit you in a trivial way (its easy to make fun of a name like Wang but other people probably also made fun of it so it would be annoying to respond to that incentive)
            - recognize when there are group incentives (playing race/gender card, portraying your groups positively beyond reason) and try to avoid using them unless necessary
            - recognize when youre being victimized (your tech inventions are being stolen by countless coordinating privileged powerful tech people bc you cant afford every patent fee for all of your inventions) and when youre allowing people to victimize you (refusing to learn a skill to support yourself), based on which problems are solvable or fair to expect someone to solve

          - errors

            - error types

              - lies

                - self-promotion
                  - criticizing without working to fix it or offering a solution so they can fix it
                  - lying without work to earn
                  - gravitating toward highly trusting nodes to avoid work

                - mis-identification
                  - identifying justifiable actions as unjustifiable, like saying that lying within potential range (say you have skill with intent/ability to acquire it) is the same as other lie types

            - error attributes (weird, obvious, presumptive, familiar, stupid, repetitive, redundant, trivial, irrelevant, self-promoting, confusing, pointless, useless)

            - error rules
              - dont fulfill error attribute without acknowledging it & ideally also fixing it at the same time or at least allocating time to form a plan or having a plan to fix it

          - communication

            - assume they dont know something until its been communicated rather than trying to make them guess, which is passive aggression
            - acknowledge & correct any miscommunications as soon as possible, otherwise let them go or wait for an organic opportunity to bring them up
            - 'dont interrupt or raise volume when diplomatically negotiating or peacemaking, repeat to confirm understanding'
            - frame something in a different way if theyre not understanding it, until they understand it - misunderstandings are usually the responsibility of the communicator rather than the interpreter
            - give other people freedom (ask them questions, ask their opinion, give them choices/opportunities to say no & to change, trust their answers when possible, give them information & insights, etc)
            - protect other people (make sure other people arent exploited more than they deserve, without making the exploiter feel too bad to recover)
            - make minor negative things seem very bad so there's no incentive to do major negative things
            - dont trust people on life-or-death matters, and dont ask people to trust you on life-or-death matters

            - criticism
              - look for people's attempts to solve problems rather than listing every mistake when criticizing
              - dont criticize in a way that cannot be recovered from if avoidable
              - criticize by removing their identity from the criticism (saying 'this person I know does this thing that bothers me' instead of criticizing them if they dont know you know they did that)
              - criticize behaviors/concepts/priorities rather than individuals
                - if you have to criticize individuals, criticize their decisions in a fair way, acknowledging any mistakes society/other people/you may have made in trying & failing to help them get everything right
              - give them solutions to their problems & examples of your mistakes or potentially making the same mistake they did, with criticism
              - recognize that people need reasons to be good & check if they have those before criticizing them
              - recognize that one person couldnt be responsible for society's problems, so avoid criticizing one person in a vacuum as if they did, or have no reason for or control over their behavior
              - try to criticize a decision before you do it & correct any problems you see before doing it

            - persuasion
              - try to win people over to a point of view with logic/facts first and if you cant, recognize their right to disagree
              - try to only convince people to do things that benefit them, and in the absence of a direct benefit to them, things that benefit society

            - lying
              - only lie when needed (like to avoid pressure to do something, if other tactics have failed to get them to stop pressuring you)
              - if someone's lying or doing another negative thing, find a way to portray their trick as positive/neutral before calling them out (rather than 'lying to the liberal media', theyre 'trying to entertain grandmas')

            - context
              - act appropriately for the context
              - dont leave out context when making points

      - state

        - have a concept of state (dont assume theyre in the same state as before or cant change their state)

        - emotional state
          - fear of a negative event that the product could prevent
          - confused or thinking or busy, other mental states than emotions than can influence sales
          - jokes to make you laugh so youre in a generous mood

        - adjacent to an invalidating state (soon wont need the product)

      - as a neural network, persuasion algorithms can be used to 'sell' a different label to a network


- mental process algorithms

  - empathy nn algorithm

    - start from positions: 
      - worst case scenarios related to attacks (planning an attack)
      - emotional sources triggering attacks (fears, etc)
      - intents related to attacks (get resources)
      - causes of attacks (irrational thinking)
      - strategies of attacks (false correlation, false sense of security, surprise)
      - strategies to prevent attacks ('never be surprised', 'assume the worst')
      - asymmetries leading to different perspectives (such as "lack of resources like information, understanding or concepts (no concept of 'fair fight', 'attack first', etc)")
      - reasoning to fulfill intents (there's usually a reason to take an action that they think will fulfill an intent)
      - alternatives to reasoning, including politeness, lack of thought, and other reasons for a decision

    - starting from all the positions & actions that have efficiencies & reasons to move the way they do or in the direction they do is a good starting point once those are identified
    - this will reduce the solution space to identify likely starting points, intents, actions, functions, and attributes, rather than having to check them all

  - confusion nn: algorithm that tries to trick a network into thinking a set of labels is correct, and the algorithm either:

      - optimizes for confusion/ambiguity for obfuscation, or for deriving differentiation methods (patterns of difference) between conflated types
      - tries to identify confusion distortions as a way to implement a common sense algorithm (if it fulfills confusion metrics, its unlikely to fit with a common sense system)

  - creativity nn: algorithm that mimics creativity in thinking of alternate possibilities/explanations
      - switch structure, abstraction, type, attribute, function, direction (like how random jokes come from a totally different direction but still have an intersection)

  - efficiency nn: algorithm with efficiency optimizations, like distributed starting points for a search through weight patterns/sets that signal to the others when they find efficiencies like automatically aligned intents or similar structures

  - emotion nn: algorithm with a concept of emotion built in, so that different modes of traversing a network can be switched between as needed 
      - anger for organizing resources (when noise is detected or when aggregating signals)
      - fear/disgust for identifying threats, joy for prioritizing & identifying rewards (to the prediction function accuracy)

  
  - these mental processes can be used in different positions, for different functions:
      
      - empathy
        - deriving starting point & other core objects like intent functions, priority attributes, etc

      - stereotype
        - fitting objects without the need for accuracy (like when mining structural similarities for pattern gains)

      - creativity
        - new paths/combinations
        - alternate paths/combinations

      - confusion
        - obfuscation
        - ambiguity
        - differentiation
        - deriving patterns (in order to resolve the point of confusion, they have to figure out why & how two types might differ & test distortion patterns to get to those differences)
      
      - persuasion: 
        
        - 'get resources without earning them' (get funds for investment in another product or a future version of the product)
          - the structural translation of this is: 'move to a target position without the aligning action to propel the move'
        
        - 'get someone to act against their own interests' (get funds for investment in another product)
          - the structural translation of this is: 'move to a target position without the aligning self-interested intent to motivate the move'

        - 'get someone to match their behavior to their own interests' (the product is good for them but they dont automatically seek it out)
          - structural translation: 'move to a target position by changing the intent direction toward the beneficial resource' (to prioritize doing whats good for them)
        
        - 'get someone to align their interests with the group' (the product is good for humanity, like free trade or other products with distributed benefits)
