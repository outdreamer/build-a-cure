## Joke

### Definition

#### Attributes

I. difference

1. silliness (extreme difference in realism)

- lack of correct priority distribution (extreme un/importance attached to extremely un/important things - high/low stakes)

- lack of logic (unconnected assumptions, jumping to conclusions, logical fallacies)

- lack of probability (categorizing highly unrealistic assertions as fact, categorizing facts as opinions, categorizing product reviews as terrorism)

- lack of knowledge (implying such a huge lack of information that its silly)

2. surprise

- subversion of expectations (diverging vectors)

	- adjacency of contradiction matters

- alternate meanings (alternate routes)

3. relevance (circular or other shapes of intersections)

- can provide surprise in the joke by being relevant to prior implication of the joke in a surprising way

II. layers (multiple combinations of other attributes in joke)

- example:
	- a joke can subvert expectations of a prior implication, or subvert expectations of the relevance of a prior implication to add another layer

III. point (implication of joke)

- a joke can have an underlying point, such as "not all stereotypes are true", or "applying the idea of stereotypes to a dog is funny because dogs cant choose their behavior so the idea of them having stereotypes to overcome is comical"

IV. brevity

- short jokes are often more difficult to construct but can be more powerful in surprise impact

- the best short jokes are those that identify an existing simple relationship (whether real or fake) between two well-known objects

V. route

- the route to a joke may add to the surprise of the joke

- example: 
- rather than just applying a standard formula like:
"replace object with a sillier object" ("my aunt thinks she's my mother" => "my aunt thinks she's my god/accountant/stylist")

you can add distortions to this standard formula by navigating through other objects first:
"replace object with an object that defeats the purpose of a prior object in a surprising way that makes a silly point"

- "my dog thinks shes my mom" => "my dog thinks she's my chew toy, im always provoking her into a fight with annoying impressions of politicians despite her repeatedly turning the other cheek in peaceful protest, except when she takes all the persecution out on plastic pikachu, continuing the unending cycle of war"

- "my dog thinks shes my best friend" => "my dog thinks she's my enemy and she's right because a real best friend wouldnt have shinier hair than you without pantene pro-v"

- the more in-depth the distortions within a context are, the funnier it will be when you switch it with an absurd object
	
	- "I would say to know me is to also know that Sonic the Hedgehog was my first childhood crush." https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/ilana-michelle-rubin-best-up-and-coming-comedian.html

		- adding extra distortions that are valid in the context of a 'crush' would make this funnier

		- things youd normally say about a 'crush' or a similar context, which is 'coming out as gay'
			- 'and that has been validated by the latest <in topical cultural artifacts>' (the latest Sonic the Hedgehog movie)
			- 'but ive gotten over it and have accepted that we can never be together bc of <society>' (bc Ive realized Tails is better, both as a character, a competitor, and a life partner)

		- contextual distortions (within the 'relationship' context) that can be left as-is, so no object-switching is required:
			- 'but hes playing games and isnt texting back right away' 
			- 'but then I went on Xanax and it made me realize it was all a chemical imbalance'
			- 'but then the MDMA high wore off and I had to go to the hospital'
				- briefer alternative: 'but then my doctor/nurse took me off the morphine'
			- 'but then I realized he was using me to get famous'
			- 'but then I realized he was golddigging me' (using relevance in the form of Sonic the Hedgehog being a known collector of gold rings, and also the absurdity of a character known to be good at collecting gold rings to be someone who is unlikely to be a golddigger, and the absurdity of a cartoon removed from most physical considerations needing money - like to buy a higher resolution or more super-powered version of himself)

VI. safety

- jokes that are reassuring in some way or produce psychological safety of the audience are funnier bc there's no threat implied by the joke

- this can overlap with relatability, bc if a joke is relatable, it will make the audience feel less judged/attacked


#### Rules

- must be tied to reality in some way (must have some nonzero non-real ratio)
- must have at least one identifying joke attribute (difference attributes (silliness, surprise, relevance), or another joke attribute) with non-standard value different from a normal sentence
- more joke types, layers, rules, & attributes usually make it funnier

#### Types

- topic (any object forming expectations, such as social group dynamics, norms, religious tenets, assumptions, stereotypes, roles, etc)
- style (meta-humor, comedian's comedy, dark humor, sarcasm, high brow, raunchy)
- attribute (contextual, political, self-aware, self-referential, fourth-wall breaking, joke commentary)
- roast (specific to an individual agent or group)

	- example roast/response of common structural features

		- big/small nose:

			- big nose: "i come from a line of drug dealers who had to test their own product as a sales tactic"
				- generative question: 
					- what is a function of the object? (testing substance)
						- what process would produce that object distortion over evolutionary time? (drug habit)

			- small nose: "my family always had farmland so we had to evolve small noses to withstand pig feeding time"
				- generative question:
					- what is a function of the object? (sensing scents)
						- what negative distortions can functions have? (too effective, sub-optimal in processing speed/accuracy)
							- what is a reason/intent of distorting the object to a smaller size? (preventing that function from being too effective)
								- what situations might produce an incentive to limit that functionality? (farm animal tasks)

		- big/small ears:
			
			- big ears: "they get bigger every time i break someone's heart, to serve as a warning" or "to hear clingy bitches coming a mile away so I can get a head start running"
				- generative question: 
					- what is a useful function of the object? (alert)
						- why would you need/evolve an alert? (to warn yourself/others)
			
			- small ears: "i come from a bloodline of spies who have evolved to eavesdrop while appearing not to"
				- generative question: 
					- what process would produce that object distortion over evolutionary time? (spying)

						- what would the usefulness of hiding a listening device be? (improved spying function)
		
		- big/small eyes:
			
			- big eyes: "Chucky/Annabel right before they molt into a fly"
				- generative question:
					- what looks structurally similar? (horror movie doll)
						- whats an extreme distortion? (fly)
							- how could one distortion become extreme? (evolution)
			
			- small eyes: "still wouldnt think youre attractive or wonderful if they were bigger, it doesnt mean you can see things that arent there"
				- generative question:
					- what do they assume will happen if they change size, that your eyes will change in function? (derive their assumption)
						- what function might they be hoping youll acquire (derive their intent from that assumption)

		- eye color:

			- brown/black eyes:
				- roast: "bug"
				- response: "dont get lost in my eyes bc you wont find love in an abyss" or "they turn red from all the crying when Im into someone"

			- green eyes: 
				- roast: "green-eyed with jealousy"
				- response: "that was something blue & brown eyed women had to come up with to trick men into hating us but it clearly didnt work"

			- blue eyes:
				- roast: "blue from the depression at how inadequate you are"
				- response: "theyre to trick pirates into thinking there's only blue skies ahead"

		- cheeks:

			- chubby cheeks: "evolved from a line of thieves to hide contraband from the police"

			- dimples: "to help cover fake smiles from the professional liars I hail from"

		- big/small hands:
			
			- "big hands are for slapping bitches who get mouthy about peoples' hands"
				- generative question: 
					- what are the functions of the object?
						- what functions could be relevant to roasts?
			
			- "small hands are for making runts feel big"
				- generative question:
					- what function could the object do, in a system context with other object attributes that vary in size?

		- minor flaws:
			- "the rest of me was too perfect to fulfill my destiny of achievement x, so God made sure I wouldnt get molested/too popular with creeps"
				- generative question:
					- what side effects does attractiveness have that are negative? (getting assaulted, being object of obsession/stalking)

		- attractive:
			- "God made me a decoy so the people with a higher destiny could avoid creeps"
				- generative question:
					- what side effects does attractiveness have that are positive? (takes unwanted attention away from other people)


	- examples of roast of non-structural features

		- roasting a decision
			- specific choice (word/fashion/career)
				- "my word, what a bible belt juggalo thing to say" or "did the redneck gays gang-dress you again on your way to work"

		- roasting an opinion
			- "imagine having to hire a philosopher to write unintelligible nonsense to sell your belief system to the morons bc the tax structure is so clearly anti-moron"

		- roasting a lie
			- pity troll: "what if you couldnt come up with a reason someone should hire you, so you had to look up a blog about a skill & then quote it as if they cant search for what you said & find the blog, have some compassion"

		- roasting a concept (like 'roasting')
			- roast invalidation: "imagine not being able to get a date so you have to get incels to help you learn how to roast me, wont someone please date this roaster by necessity"
			- horror troll: "what if you couldnt tell that roasting an individual as a group revealed your obsession with & inferiority to that individual, your life would be so hard if you were that stupid - what if they cant tell theyre stupid? lets get these people on medicare, maybe theres some research trial that could help their brains grow"
			- curious troll: 
				- "i didnt know there were still people living in the humiliation game era where people dont realize roasting is about control? it's like discovering an isolated tribe in a jungle"
				- "isnt it interesting that some species of monkeys used to do roasting as an easy means of acquiring resources bc they never evolved intelligence"

		- contextual roast:
			- when someone roasts an attribute their own partner has: "are you trying to teach me how to love your partner"
			- when someone repeats someone else's roast: "copying is only cute when x does it"
			- when someone re-uses an old roast bc they cant think of a new one: "heres the roast you would have said if you could think"

		- abstract roast (for general use):
			- you dont have to scream how much my achievements bother you by attacking me out of nowhere
			- you know that other people being happy isnt a direct attack on you right
			- you know you didnt have to interpret my comment about group x to be about you right
			- are you aware of other reasons to live than hunting happy people
			- do you realize that when you respond emotionally to a comment about a group, people realize youre probably in that group
			- do you want tips on how to sell a roast? such as 'your smile cant be very obviously fake & rehearsed'
			- you know when you do a fake laugh in response to a roast that people immediately understand you cant retort right

#### Common joke components/functions

1. varying value on silliness spectrum:

- factual (definitely real): cats hate mice
- probable: cats hate things that run away
- not likely: cats hate things that run fast
- unlikely: cats hate things that move on wheels
- extremely unlikely: cats hate people in wheelchairs (the disabled)
- possible: cats hate people who make money move
- impossible: cats hate Jesus Christ, who created physics

2. silly divergence in expectations

- "a Mexican and a Jew walk into a bar. The Jew asks the Mexican if he's going to order a margarita. "What you think all Mexicans drink margaritas, ese?" They start fighting, and the Jew accidentally lands a punch on the Mexican, who bleeds a clear liquid that catches fire from a nearby drink. "Ay! Dios mio!" squealed the Mexican. "Watch your fists, holmes - don't you know Mexicans bleed tequila, wey? Not next to the flaming jello shots, amigo!" 
- the expectation is that the joke will imply the Jew was being racist, but it ends up implying the opposite of that expectation
- another layer of comedy comes from the idea of a Jew being the oppressor of another race, which has some historical context lending silliness to that implication

3. surprising relevance

I. relevance circle

- relevance circles can be funny because they can add a layer of surprise - connecting things that wouldnt normally be connected

- "the prison guard reminded the convicts that they could be let out early for good behavior, instead of playing dead when it was time to take their medicine, and only peeing on purebred dogs on the basketball court" 
- has prison gang (purebred/race supremacist) relevance tied to initial implication of prison guard-criminal dynamic

II. intersection of alternate meaning waves

- "the computer disk's memory was corrupted, so it didnt recognize its mother John McAfee and thought he was trying to kill it with antivirus medication, to prevent it from exploiting browser caches for personal gain"

- has two intersection points of alternate meaning waves for "memory" & "corruption"

1. memory corruption => amnesia

2. memory corruption => paranoia of being caught in corrupt, exploitative transactions, related to memory management

- also has a relevance circle, tying the end implication "corrupt exploitative memory management" to the first implication "memory was corrupted", and the middle implication "paranoid amnesia"

III. defeating the purpose

- defeating the purpose of a prior implication in the joke (subversion of expectations, in the form of contradicting relevance of prior implication)

- finding the silliest possible position for an object to occupy, given what the object is

- "the oreo CEO submitting a flavor suggestion in their next flavor contest"
- the implication that "they have no other power to influence that decision" defeats the purpose of "being a CEO"

- irony: 

- reversal/perversion of intent & relevant implication

- framing "bias based on unchosen attributes" (racism, gender bias) as an "unchosen attribute":
    
- example: "racism/gender bias is passed on genetically"
  intent: "persecution is racist", implication: "racists are persecuted"

- example: "the tiger conservationist was eaten by a tiger"
  intent: "protecting tigers", implication: "protecting themselves from tigers"

IV. topical for recent trends

- many jokes, like insights, have a time limit of relevance, and are most powerful when new, articulating a previously unarticulated trend that many were feeling was absurd, but none had captured with language
- some classic jokes retain power because theyre insightful to most people who encounter them, and not incorporated in the culture as a default assumption yet

4. comical difference

- comical differences can be between any object (assumption, definition, adjacent object, implication, topic, type, layer, attribute, rule, etc) in the joke and any other object, if there is an expectation for those objects to distort in the first place

- examples:

- between one sentence & the next: 
"I told my mom I was going to run some errands, so I dog-walked my neighbor."

- between style & content: 
"Mariah Carey believes George Foreman grills to be a relatable & timeless reference. In this essay I will" (style: serious essay writing, content: silly pop music)

- assumption taken to an exaggerated extreme version of itself:
"Yeah friends are cool but ... you ever caught something you dropped before it reached the ground?"
(yes it feels good, but this is an extreme exaggeration of how good it feels)

- extreme realism of a silly assumption
"officer wishbone has requested time-off to deal with the loss of his wife, squeaky pikachu toy"
(silly assumption: "dog is a police officer", extreme realism: "depression after loss of a loved one, which for a dog might be a squeaky toy")

- framing something very unlikely as extremely obvious assumption
"I took the dog to the barber with me, because it wasnt fair that I got to change my hair style every week. Besides, if I didnt take her to the barber, someone else would cut her hair while I wasnt being vigilant, you have to be careful"

- mad libs: replacing objects or verb in a normal sentence with silly versions
normal sentence: "library study buddy oversold their history class skills"
silly sentence: "library study buddy oversold their quiet-chip-eating skills"

- lists of unrelated things (mixing abstraction level, topic, etc)
"the main reason I was late is not just traffic but also grandma gangs, highway lane-switching personal dramas, the Jews who run the media, manipulative billboard copywriters, bank robber getaway chases, Trent Reznor, the liberal media, and the Office franchise making everyone slower on the highway because theyre busy arguing about who Michael should have ended up with instead of focusing on the road"

- finding silly possibilities (aim for unlikely rather than extremely silly or extremely realistic, because unlikeliness is more surprising, subtler, & difficult to find)

- mixing extremely different social abstractions (types, identities, positions, relationships, histories, conceptual objects like assumptions/priorities) is often comical because norms & differences between social groups are often silly or pointless or insignificant, so pretending they're important differences is comical

- "everyone assumes white people cause all of society's problems, and they're partially right, because some goths are white, and so are some Jews, and so are some clowns"

<img src="Screen Shot 2018-10-24 at 3.41.49 AM.png" />

- a combination of an assumption & an illogically concluded assumption (misunderstanding) to generate extreme silliness (stupidity):
"the stadium rules dont say 'dont feed the players' so that means they want us to throw popcorn at them"

- juxtaposition of big ego/high stakes with trivial/minor details to generate pettiness:
"I called the cops because no one complimented my Xmas sweater"

- assuming the insanity/stupidity of an agent to generate silliness
"is there a mental institution nearby with a recent break-out who would like to speak with you?"

- acting the role of straight enforcer on a chaotic generator of rule-breaking to generate comical difference, such as framing "regulating others' lack of self-awareness of their misunderstandings" as a "need" rather than an "option", which is how it would normally be classified

"I can recommend a good therapist, if you genuinely need to keep talking about your dog's unwillingness to match outfits with you"

- sarcastically agreeing with silly statements as if they're true

- humoring an insane person (where the insane person is the silliness generator, and the contrast between their beliefs & reality is the key difference - related to sarcasm)
"I can see why you thought wearing a hijab would make you popular with Muslims, rather than peaceably co-existing with them, which wasnt getting you any personal attention, which is specifically forbidden in the Quran"

- huge cognitive & semantic distance between previous & current sentence to generate surprise:
"yeah I could have taken those bullies - to church, but I didnt have my church bus pass on me because I keep it in my respect-for-Jesus/sinning pants"

	- https://www.vulture.com/article/comedians-reveal-jokes-theyd-like-to-steal.html

- “This shirt is dry-clean only, which means it’s dirty.”

	- subverting implication:
		- if you bring up a topic like "how to take care of a shirt", that implies you do take care of it
		- but "comically", much to the surprise of your audience, you do not

- “I don’t have a girlfriend. I just know a girl who would get really mad if she heard me say that.”

	- subverting the definition of a 'girlfriend' using common stereotypes/rules associated with that definition

	- comically scenic alternate route to the 'girlfriend' definition through 'knowing someone who would get really mad if she heard me say that'

- “I like the escalator, because the escalator cannot break. It just becomes stairs.”

	- popular pattern of 'epic power-up' for comedic effect when taken to extreme: 
		- it 'becomes stairs' by choice like it's no big deal ('just'), bc it has the power to do that, which is funny bc it implies agency is accessible to all, which adds psychological safety to the joke
		- the escalator defies the idea of being breakable by subverting the definition of breaking, as its very powerful

	- brevity in the way that an escalator cannot break (four words 'it just becomes stairs') - this implies its an existing simple relationship that wasnt identified/articulated by other people, which is inherently funny

	- subversion of the implication of an escalator breaking being a 'bad thing' to make it seem a neutral thing 'it may seem like a bad thing, but it just becomes stairs'

	- high stakes situation 'breaking' converted to low stakes situation 'becoming stairs'

- “I’m sick of following my dreams, man. I’m just going to ask them where they’re going, and hook up with them later.”
	
	- joke type based on assumption: reification fallacy/anthropomorphization (assigning agency to inanimate objects or concepts)

	- contrast of mundane experience (boredom) and rare or fortunate experience (interaction with dreams)

- “I like rice. Rice is great when you’re hungry and you want 2,000 of something.”
	- irrelevance: using irrelevant metadata of a meal (how many units are in it) as (comically) the primary intention for it

- “I don’t have a microwave oven, but I do have a clock that occasionally cooks shit.” 
	- subverting the intent of a microwave oven (cooking) for one of its side effects (showing numbers in a time format), which is "comically" misunderstood

- “I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to, too.”
	- subverting the implication of 'i used to do drugs' which implies it was in the past and is over now, by "comically" surprising the audience by adding that it's also happening in the present tense

	- adding brevity & adjacency of contradiction ('used to do drugs' is immediately followed by 'still do')

- “I saw a commercial on late-night TV that said ‘Forget everything you know about slipcovers.’ So I did. It was a load off my mind. Then the commercial tried to sell slipcovers and I didn’t know what the hell they were.” 
	- "comical" impact ('invalidating intent of ad, which is to inform & sell') of trusting instructions ('forget everything') of people claiming expertise ('the experts in slipcovers') & delegating your agency to them 

	- "comical" difference between intentions & outcome (also an example of defeating the purpose): the advice of experts should inform you, but this removed the information, invalidating their intent

- “You can’t please all the people all the time, and last night, all those people were at my show.”

	- non-standard organizing principle: the idea of 'all the people who cant be pleased' being at one show is absurd, as people dont usually organize themselves in that way (theres no explicit 'people who cant be pleased' organization)
	- subverting the intent of a comedy show, which is to please people
	- stakes: only a petty person who knew they couldnt be pleased would go to a comedy show anyway just to criticize it

- "ill put up with anything": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHwKmZnc7l4

	- framing an object of a type (fact) as another type (joke) is a "comical" difference
	- taking premise to extreme (adding more relatable things airlines do)
	- subverting intent of things airlines do (normal business operations, making money) with "comically" different intents (persecuting one individual, exploiting their power just to feel powerful)
	- subverting definition of 'man' with stereotypically 'girly' behaviors

- “I don’t care if someone’s black, white, green, or purple. Actually if they’re purple, you should care. They’re choking to death.”

	- subverting the implication: including 'green' and 'purple' in a set of real colors implies the idea of 'all possible colors', which is removing the color attribute from the set of important attributes (if it includes all values of the color attribute, the color attribute is non-determining), and then assigning importance to one color

	- "comical" difference between implication & tone of one statement (teamwork/coexistence/tolerance, caring tone) with implication of the next statement (emergency rescue advice)

	- a better joke would have been if the comedian had implied someone was white and then said something like: 'actually if theyre black you should care, theyre doing blackface & are about to be trolled to internet death'
		- this is better because it doesnt rely on silliness to add humor, because it stays within the set of real colors people can be

- 'a-a-ron': https://youtu.be/Dd7FixvoKBw
	- subverting assumption of a non-standard name structure being too silly to be real
	- using standard name patterns in a sub-culture to emphasize "comical" difference between definitions of absurdity in names from exploited & privileged subcultures
	- using frame of 'classroom attendance call by a substitute teacher' which is a common/real context for listing/discussing names by someone who is unfamiliar with them
	- using comical associations with 'trolling substitute teacher'

- "getting a wax is like an animal being chased by a cheetah & immediately being eaten": https://youtu.be/111Ggf3jMq8
	- comical difference between expectations ('Ill easily survive being chased by the cheetah') with reality ('no I wont')
	- stupidity of having no chance at survival but still trying
	- comical difference of 'survival' & 'waxing'

- you’re like, “That guy’s an asshole,” and your friend is like, “No, he’s not an asshole, he’s just insecure.” And you’re like, “If he’s so insecure, then why is he drunk and throwing raisins at me? Shouldn’t he be at home doubting himself?”
	- subverting definition of asshole & insecurity
	- comical difference between insecure & asshole rules
	- weird/silly attribute of 'throwing raisins' which is not a normal behavioral rule for either of those definitions, nor is it associated with the drunk definition
	- relevance in re-using the implication of 'common location' from the party definition to permute that attribute with the expected behavior from the insecure definition ('should be at home')

- “It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine.”
	
	- setup of a modifier 'never' & an extreme 'difficult' applied to a verb 'distinguish' which highlights the differences between the possible, obvious, and implied interpretations

		- 'easy to distinguish': stating the obvious
		- 'always/often difficult to distinguish': sarcasm
		- 'rarely/often difficult to distinguish': adds comedic impact through highlighting the difference given by the absolute 'never'
		- 'never difficult to distinguish': opposite permutation of sarcasm that states the obvious, adding extra comedic impact through highlighting the difference
			- the association of 'never difficult to distinguish' with tact, which lends comedic impact through subtlety of stating the obvious, which adds an element of surprise, an input of comedy
			- tact is associated with 'understatement' which is often used for comedic impact through juxtaposition (saying 'the president is influential' is a comedic understatement to describe the most powerful position, if it's true)
			- tact can also take the form of a circuitous route, here in stating a fact (adding extra modifiers or taking a very unlikely route to a point)

	- comparing between:

		- a person type
			- with:
				- an association with serious topics like war and serious instruments like moustaches and serious tones like northern darkness
				- a social info object (reason to have a particular emotion like anger, as a standardized info object 'complaint', having an association with illegitimacy 'grievance')

		- and:
			- an idiom for frivolousness that contradicts the associations of the info object and the person type

		- with conditions:
			- where the person type is a ridiculous way to distinguish people (nation of origin), but it is assumed that they have non-standard behavior (scottish heritage is a predictor for non-standard behavior regarding a grievance, which is why it's being mentioned) and that they have an anti-association with the idiom topic (scottish heritage is a predictor for a non-sunny disposition)


	- applying filters to reduce the possible interpretations to maximize the impact:

		- association with 'a ray of sunshine' being used to describe angry people historically, built in to the language
		- association of 'grievance' being with illegitimate anger

		- taking these associations together reduces the possibility of the interpreter detecting a real threat to the scotsman


### Building consensus with jokes

- using 'friendly fire' jokes to build consensus & inspire confrontation of ridiculous beliefs
- one way to get people on your side is being extra decent when they expect you to fight them
- honesty is also important - find a way to make the truth funny, assuming the worst is true & building jokes on that


#### Friendly fire humor


#### Gun Laws

This means instead of accusing republicans of killing people with their 'ignorance is bliss' approach to guns, you need to use humor to make your points in a way that doesnt antagonize them

In that case an example would mean finding a democrat killed by guns and then you could say 
- 'ok that guy deserved it, but in general i dont like guns'

And build a joke on top of that like 
- 'maybe we could have a legal one-person sacrifice once every year and the Garys of the world would be hunted & you all could get out all your gun aggression on that person'

And make it clear youre joking - that would get pro-gun people on your side even without committing to that kind of policy, and anyone who objects just looks stupid for not getting that its a joke. This makes it possible for them to confront the extreme negative possibilities of their own beliefs (that some innocent person who could be them someday gets murdered by a gun) in an honest way that doesnt make them hate you bc you did it in a funny way - it's partly the improv method of 'yes and' but in a way that makes your original point, mixed with their actual beliefs, taken to a comical extreme.


#### Abortion

On stuff like abortion you can ask them for scientific proof like:
- 'we should make babies sign a contract or pass a test proving that theyre not going to torture their parents by being failures or asking for stuff all the time or prove that they came from the holy dimension instead of hell and that they arent possessed by the devil & arent the antichrist, or else they have to get in the dumpster'
- 'we should have a return policy on babies if you find out theyre the antichrist or the second coming of jesus which would be a lot'

If theyre religious you can do the friendly fire humor again:
- 'the only reason I didnt get an abortion was I didnt want Jesus looking in there to check me for virtuous behavior' that mixes their beliefs with some ridiculousness that makes your original point and doesnt make them feel bad


#### Medical Care

- 'we should make a deal with doctors that they get to kill their most annoying patient once a year if they make a big contribution to science'
- 'if patients want medical care without the new disability of crippling debt, they should have to prove that theyre below a certain level of annoying'
- 'if patients want to keep complaining about bills & request unnecessary, they can pay for their doctors' therapy'
- 'patients can be their own doctors by shooting off the bacteria with their medical rifles'
- 'patients only get science if theyre willing to protect gun rights with their lives'
- 'people who get old & acquire an infestation of legal teams arent mentally strong enough to will their medical problems such as aging & legal staff away'
- 'republicans are hobbits & they need our charity to find a cure'
- 'republicans hate scientists bc they would figure out they were hobbits'


#### Basic Income

- 'imagine the robot industry innovations if Trump had had basic income'
- 'Trumps painting of himself as a ripped superhero would be real if he had had basic income'
- 'we would be able to hire a 24/7 security team to chase Trump off the golf course if there was basic income bc people would volunteer for that if they didnt have to worry about the basics'


### Truth humor

- assume that:
	- everyone wants to kill you
	- everyone is evil
	- everyone is lying
	- everyone is competing

- and then make it funny:

	- homicidal urges
		- 'ill pitch in on the casket if you promise to wait until we pass this bill to hire a hitman'

	- ubiquitous evil
		- 'you can throw me to the rednecks once we take away their guns & ill fight them with a fistfight like a lady would'

	- eternal lies
		- 'i know by "lets take away the guns" you really mean "lets experiment on citizens after they dont have guns"'

	- competing
		- petty humor (Larry David style, suspicious & cares about stupid low-stakes things)
