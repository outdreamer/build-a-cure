- lie detection

	- question: 'is it true'

		- connect statement to truth

			- connect statement to possibility & probability

				- is the statement possible/probable/certain

	- question: 'do they have a reason to say it other than stating truth'

		- connect statement to intents like 'fulfill an incentive or priority' or lack of intent like a default habit

			- find intents/incentives/priorities of a statement
				- 'bc its true', 'bc its polite', 'bc its random', 'bc they mean it', 'to get a reaction' (trolling), 'end a conversation', 'amuse themselves', 'undermine you', 'to get stuff (attention, compliments, favors)', 'bc they saw someone else say it on tv/social circle and saw that person get rewards', 'bc its fun to say', 'to make conversation/keep the conversation going', 'to make a point', 'to trigger other conversations/questions/assumptions/conclusions/jokes/other info objects'

			- find contexts where that statement would be used for those incentives/priorities (check if the context contains info confirming a particular intent/incentive/priority)
				- connect statement to context
					- what is the meaning of the statement given the context

			- find reactions delivering the intent/incentivized reward/priority of a statement
				- connect statement to possible/probable reactions
					- are those reactions likely for that statement
					- did they expect that reaction for that statement
		
	- quick insight path: 'how would my reaction to this statement benefit them'

		- how to derive the quick insight path:
			- lying is an interaction type (social interaction)
				- the reason to interact is to make an info trade (exchanging info with conversation)
					- just like in other social interactions, the liar intends to get info from giving info
						- what info do they intend to get?
							- lies are low-cost, high-reward false info
					- by giving a lie (low-cost false info), they intend to get high-reward info
						- what info could be high-reward?
							- any info that makes them feel good has a reward (intents/incentives/priorities above, like 'entertainment')
								- they expect to get info that feels good by giving a lie
									- they expect this info in the format of a 'response' (reaction)
										- look for reactions that would benefit the liar, given their intents/incentives/priorities to get info rewards at a low cost

		- a quicker way to derive the important concept of 'beneficial reactions' is:
			- identifying the high-variation variables (reaction variable)
			- identifying the pattern of frequent association between lying input & beneficial reaction output

- insight path to derive patterns & rules from one example

	- with one example, you can use abstraction to derive relevant concepts
		- example: from one song, derive patterns of successful songs
			- alignment of patterns
				- circular pattern aligned with vacillation pattern
				- level of variation from chord
				- repeating pattern on different starting points
				- return to original pattern
				- alternation between patterns of expectation (repetition) and surprise (variation)
			- conceptual structures
				- sequential structures: melody, chorus, tension buildup/peak/release cycles
				- unit structures: chord, variation units (jumping octave, increase/decrease at constant interval, variation around a note)
				- limit structures: the threshold of variation around a chord/note or threshold of repetition that is successful
		- using the changes or lack of changes around these objects, you can infer the concept of 'variation' as relevant, as well as 'repetition' and 'alignment'

	- question: is it better to have an example of a successful song (adjacently relevant correct pattern info) or can an unsuccessful song provide enough info (indirect error type info to derive correct patterns)?

- truth derivation

	- removal of biases (incentives)
		- assumption bias: bias toward pre-existing perspective embedded in information
			- understanding bias: bias toward pre-existing system representing understanding
		- self bias: bias toward own ideas/intents/feelings/thoughts
		- intent bias: bias to achieve a goal
			- incentive bias: bias to achieve an incentivized goal (avoid pain, get reward)
		- similarity bias: bias toward similar
		- simplicity bias: bias toward simplicity
		- anti-randomness bias: bias against randomness (tend to see meaning where it's not there)
