# Selecting a Problem Solving Automation Starting Point


## Relationships


- problem space: 

	- definition: 
		- relevant information to solving a problem, or info describing a system with problems
		- the set of system(s) allowing a problem to occur

	- attributes:
		- can interact with multiple systems (bio, chemistry, markets)
		- can have a similar structure to systems (host space, network structure, etc)
		- can be a system
		- is restricted by information thats definitely or possibly relevant to the problem

	- structures:
		- dimensions containing system structures (network, chain, tree, slice) and problem structures

	- examples:

		- 'how to break a problem into sub-components'
		- 'how to find information in a data store'
		- 'given current tech, whats the best way to count votes'

		- for a problem like 'conflicting intent with incentives in loan market', the problem space contains:
			- relevant objects (loans, loaners, borrowers, interest rates, banks, reserve, laws)
			- relevant variables (market demand & supply for business of borrower, resources of both primary agents)
			- relevant rules (existing laws, process to get laws passed

	- anti-metadata:
	    - no rule preventing repetition: "given that there's no rule in the problem space prohibiting shapes from repeating, and that repeated shapes are possible in space of any dimension greater than 0 (point), repetition could lead to the illusion of a relationship due to similarity in the repeated shapes"


- solution space:

	- definition: 

		- the set of possible combinations of resources that can achieve a demanded intent in the problem space

	- attributes:

		- can be a new trajectory between nodes (ordered combination)
		- can be the injection of variance or other systems/patterns into the relevant problematic systems
		- can define a path in an unused/unenforced variance gap
		- can decompose a problem shape into a point by reducing its dimensions
			- example: 
				- a problem shape in a problem space is a shape that doesnt need to exist at all, and is a combination of problem dimensions (conflict, inefficiency, mismatch, missing information) which dont add value to the problem space, so it can be reduced without creating other problems

	- structures:

		- interaction matrix of potential interactions between system components
		- trajectory
		- shape filling a gap
		- map between problem & solved problems
		- set of decomposing functions for a problem shape

	- examples:

		- solution space for 'finding area under a curve' includes:

			- breaking non-linear form into a progression (sum of sub-shapes)
			- finding area of transformed/adjacent objects
			- finding area of terms & mapping to influence on original function area
				- influence can be in the form of original value, term metadata, or set of alternate terms that can create the same output
				- example:
					- if theres a x^2 term in the equation, that limits the ways that the area can vary (in relative terms to the function with that term removed, which is less limited)

			- finding relationship between metadata of generating functions of boundaries (generating function for adjacent object boundary & generating function for original object boundary) & relationship between generating function metadata & boundary function output metadata (summed distance to axis standard)


- system:

	- definition: set of rules & objects

	- attributes:
		- can interact with multiple systems/problem/solution spaces
		- cooperation/communication/binding sites (openings in system)

	- structures:
		- core system structures: network, nodes, links, filters, & boundary
		- layers
		- vertices 
			- core points (corrollary of core functions)
			- sets of generating functions/objects/attributes/constants/types that determine the system
			- for example, the center is a vertex of a circle
		- hubs
		- gaps
		- limits (dependencies/incentives/intents/paradoxes)

	- relationships:
		- relevant interfaces & interface trajectories
		- applicable spaces              

	- functions

	- examples:

		- for a problem space of solving a memory storage problem, these can be relevant systems:
			
			- software/hardware evolution
				- open source
				- automation patterns
				- platforms/frameworks
				- marketplaces
				- security
				- full tech stack
				- algorithms
				- data structures
				- memory optimization
				- computation (space/time tradeoff, parallel execution, pre-computation, queuing)

			- chemistry: materials science

			- physics: electricity
