Data structures and algorithms study guide

- problem-solving tips

	- if there is a nested iteration implied, look for a constraint that indicates a way around iteration
		- for example, checking for an output constraint that can be iterated/checked instead of the input values:
			- a sum constraint can indicate an output (as in the sum) to check rather than iterating through every possible value to sum
			- a constraint on relevant output values can indicate a smaller alternate output iteration to perform rather than iterating through every possible input value

- data structures
	- lists
	- tuples
	- dictionaries
	- sets
	- linked lists
	- stacks (LIFO)
	- queues (FIFO)
	- trees
	- graphs

- algorithms

- sorting algorithms
	- quick sort
	- merge sort
	- tim sort
	- bubble sort

- search algorithms
	- linear search
	- binary search

- graph algorithms
	- BFS
	- DFS
	- djikstra's algorithm

- dynamic programming
	- solving problems by breaking them into sub-problems

- greedy algorithms
	- making locally optimal choices like kruskal's algorithm
