		Table: Useful Physics Intents and Supporting Concepts

			Useful Intent (if true/possible)	Description of Usefulness	Physics Concept(s) That Might Support It	How the Concept Could Connect to the Intent
			1. Instant, zero-cost information transfer	Enables instantaneous coordination, computation, communication, and synchronization across any distance.	Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Teleportation	Entanglement correlations appear nonlocal; though not classical info transfer, entanglement-assisted teleportation hints toward deeper informational connectedness.
			2. Zero-loss energy transfer or storage	Perfect efficiency in energy systems, no waste heat or entropy increase.	Superconductivity, Superfluidity	Electrons in superconductors flow without resistance; suggests regimes where dissipation vanishes.
			3. Locally controllable gravity (“antigravity” or gravity shielding)	Enables levitation, propulsion, structural manipulation.	General Relativity curvature control, Negative Energy Density (Casimir effect)	Manipulating spacetime curvature or negative pressure regions could create local gravity modulation.
			4. Matter-energy conversion at small scales	Enables universal manufacturing, recycling, or propulsion.	E=mc², Pair Production/Annihilation	Mass-energy equivalence already shows mutual convertibility; controlling it efficiently would make “matter synthesis” practical.
			5. Perfect measurement (non-invasive observation)	Allows full knowledge of quantum systems without collapse or disturbance.	Weak Measurement, Quantum Non-Demolition Measurement	These techniques reduce measurement back-action, hinting at a limit where observation doesn’t disturb the system.
			6. Universal time control (slow down, pause, rewind)	Enables temporal engineering, prediction, or simulation.	Relativity (time dilation), Closed Timelike Curves, Quantum Reversibility	Relativistic effects show time is variable; some quantum frameworks (unitary evolution) are time-reversible in principle.
			7. Self-repairing, self-organizing matter	Reduces entropy, maintains order without external input.	Dissipative Structures, Autopoiesis, Quantum Coherence in Biology	Systems far from equilibrium (like Bénard cells or living systems) locally decrease entropy via energy throughput.
			8. Instant spatial relocation (teleportation)	Eliminates travel time, opens up instantaneous access to distant regions.	Quantum Teleportation, Wormholes (Einstein–Rosen bridges)	Teleportation transfers quantum states; traversable wormholes (if physically real) might connect spacetime regions directly.
			9. Universal computation substrate	A physical medium capable of representing and transforming all computable processes.	Quantum Computing, Cellular Automata, Holographic Principle	The holographic principle and quantum information theory suggest the universe itself is an information processor.
			10. Entropy reversal / local negentropy creation	Allows reversing disorder, maintaining information indefinitely.	Maxwell’s Demon, Quantum Error Correction, Time-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics	Information theory connects entropy and information; active error correction parallels “negentropic” processes.
			11. Extraction of useful energy from vacuum (zero-point energy)	Infinite clean power source.	Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations, Casimir Effect	Quantum fields have baseline energy; if harnessable, that’s a limitless energy reservoir.
			12. Information-to-matter conversion (“printing reality”)	Enables matter fabrication directly from information patterns.	Holographic Universe, Quantum State Reconstruction	The universe might encode 3D matter as 2D information on boundaries; suggests information → structure transformation.
			13. Instant synchronization of consciousness / collective awareness	Enhances coordination, understanding, and social intelligence.	Quantum Coherence in Neural Systems (Penrose-Hameroff), Entanglement Analogies	Though speculative, quantum coherence or entanglement analogies in cognition hint at shared informational substrates.
			14. Stable faster-than-light travel or information flow	Enables interstellar expansion and real-time communication.	Tachyons, Alcubierre Warp Drive (metric engineering)	Solutions to Einstein’s equations allow apparent FTL via spacetime warping.
			15. Universal pattern recognition (“physics-level AI”)	The universe natively identifies and optimizes information structures.	Renormalization Group, Information Geometry, Free Energy Principle	Physics already filters structure through energy minimization; these frameworks unify physical and cognitive inference.
