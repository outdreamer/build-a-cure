- identifying vulns with AI
- Almanax, Corgea, ZeroPath, Gecko, and Amplify

- create a table like this of symptoms, probable problem root cause, and tools/tests to use to identify whether that problem is relevant to the symptom
- problem symptoms, probable problem root cause, tool to identify problem, successful test case, solution/fix
	    - website credentials being stolen, XSS, XSS scanning tool, check if pysa identifies an XSS in code, if it does then auto-escape output before including it in html and avoid using innerhtml/eval and use nonces in scripts
