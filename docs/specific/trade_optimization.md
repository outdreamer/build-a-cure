## Optimization

  - Determining which queries/calculations are optimal

    - given that certain calculations have known cost estimates, which calculations are optimal, in what order/frequency, and given what information?
    - example: when deriving a prediction function, when do you query for function & function generator patterns, when do you request more data, when do you continue assessing regression, when do you apply standardization?
    - is it optimal to solve this problem set or another problem set, or deploy resources to both?
    - solution distribution: should this solution be deployed at run time, in a specific system, should the solution be stored as its generator function, etc


## Optimal Resource Trades

  - famine, farmland, mine field location data
  - cost of removing mines
  - cost of transporting people
  - which land is for sale & at what cost
  - how much land is necessary to support a person
  - set of resource trade sets across projected weather patterns for next 10 years to generate migration paths
  - which farmland is more optimally used for something else (harvesting other natural resources, water supply, city)
  - which cities have industries to support new workers moving there
  - what distribution of cities/farms is optimal for reducing resource transportation cost
  - how much does it cost to train someone to maintain a garden
  - what is the configuration of farmland & farm input supply chains that reduces supplies transportation cost
  - what is the import/export potential of each region (which crops & other resources can they produce)
  - what distribution of industries should occur by distance from ocean/water source
  - what infrastructure can optimize farmland at lowest cost
  - which laws are commonly reused across governments & are generally agreed to not be exploitative of citizens
  - what distribution of courts/police/lawyers is necessary to distribute fairness in markets
  - what compoments of this can be automated/updated automatically & which should be done with manual input
  - what tools do they need other than farmland 
    (water source, sun, cell phone, charger, electricity, portable wi-fi generator, app to track their assets, app to trade by phone, app to request supplies/loans)


## Position trades (Navigation model)

    - predict variance sources & ratios:
      - type/shape/movement/interaction interface variance sources:
        - is an object that moves in restricted directions likely to be sentient life (delivery robot)
        - can sentient life move in restricted directions (drug addict, multi-tasking, drunk)
        - can interactions predict movement types (waving across street, looking at phone, predicting drivers' moves, checking street for cars/behind car before crossing/backing up)
        - are objects of a certain shape or size associated with different movement types (small objects are faster, larger objects have more obvious momentum physics, smaller objects likelier to be capable of flight)
      - assumption/hypothesis interface variance sources
        - are assumptions of a certain variance level given a certain minimum information associated with prediction accuracy
        - are multiple contradictory starting hypothesis associated with higher prediction accuracy, if so, with what degree of variance between hypotheses?


## Work trades

  - work distribution & incentivization

    - system users should always be system builders, so their incentives don't crystallize into an irreversibly static state
    - users should be builders by the end of each game
    - the questions of each problem space can be mapped to user tasks within a game, defined by a set of rules creating similar questions answerable in the game
    - when builders have taught enough users, builders should move on to being users of another game, in an alternating cycle

## Risk trades
  
  - security

    - one-time use stack (network, os, app) in extension of one-time password

      - when ISP tech is distributed (network drones/satellites), you can also switch network providers for each message, in an agreed-on stack-switching pattern determined at start of conversation, using agreed-on pattern decompression algorithm

  - election security

    - apply your other solution to election security:

      - given a range of expected votes in a category, how much does final result deviate from expected votes

        - if an attribute like intelligence is associated with a particular vote, and outcome count deviates from known attribute count to this degree, what set of ratios of deviation can be attributed to noise and what percentage to interference/fraud?

        - what is the path between the determining attribute (intelligence) & the output concept (interference/fraud)?
            - is lack of intelligence a few transforms away from the output concept
              - meaning, if stupidity is associated with voting for the x party, is interference actual fraud given that its still indicating the expected stupidity rates in population?
              - or if stupidity is associated with voting for the x party, is the result inevitable, regardless of how it's achieved (they wouldve voted the same way as the fraudster tricked them into voting or artificially chose their vote with data manipulation)

  - crypto

    - use predictive tools to predict transactions & calculate them in advance to speed up tx

      - this would assess people's known resources to build an index of global demand/supply, then calculating through these resource distributions, economic incentives for trades, social networks, platform dominance, & product availability & findability (search results rankings) - which tx were likely to happen where for which products, then calculate those tx in advance


## Info trades (Learning models)

    - learning models:

      - brain learns through various reward models:
      - short term rewards: storing useful information
      - long term rewards: storing useful functions
      - adaptive/reusable rewards: storing functions by relevance or abstraction
      - on-demand rewards: storing function-generating methods/interfaces
      - reward potential-maximization: storing derivation method core functions

      - not only does ML have the potential to derive combinations like type paths & insight paths, it can derive other system/interface metadata such as core functions:
        - example:
          https://techxplore.com/news/2020-01-alphafold-protein.html

      - you don't have to rely on disorder to detect order if you have an ordered way of generating disorder patterns

    - web info trades:

      - tokenizing common content/content-generation functions on clients & in communications
      - calculating computable sub-components & delegating computation to nodes on network trajectory
        - this means if executing a process on content isnt efficient on the source system, calculate network trajectory to route communication toward servers that are better for that computation & start sending content unprocessed and process it on those servers
        - if you had a communication protocol that supported common content tokens, sending content to servers that are better at converting content to tokenized form would be better than a random or non-optimized server
        - sending converted tokenized content & the id of the tokenization map on different routes adds some interim security
      - using neutrinos as a way to speed up communication using them as jumping-off/charging points



## Rule trades

  - protocol recommendations
  
    - auto-update crypto keys/algorithms to use constants that are always guaranteed to be below x% risk that they'll be hacked given common computational resources.
