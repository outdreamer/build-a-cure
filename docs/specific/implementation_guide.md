# Implementation Instructions

## Object Model

- this is a simple index of objects as class instances

- uses:
	- problem-solving automation method to query objects/attributes/types/rules and reduce solution space or identify causative factor in problem

- tech debt:
	- identify data sources (code bases defining schema/class definitions)
	- implement import
	- implement identification functions (objects/attributes/types/rules) to gather more data
	- implement object operation functions (combine, merge, apply, mix, filter)
	- implement object function set (change functions, boundary functions, probability functions)
