# Implementation Instructions


## Object Model

- this is a simple index of objects as class instances

- uses:
	- predict interactions & optimal versions of objects/attributes/types/rules
		- predict emergent objects/attributes/types/rules
	- problem-solving automation method to query objects/attributes/types/rules and reduce solution space or identify causative factor in problem

- tech debt:
	- identify data sources (code bases defining schema/class definitions)
	- implement data sanitization & import
	- implement identification functions (objects/attributes/types/rules) to gather more data pre-indexed
	- implement object operation functions (combine, merge, apply, mix, filter)
	- implement object function set (change functions, boundary functions, probability functions)


## System Analysis

	- extension of object model
	- fits objects indexed in object model together in a system
	- observes not just rules between objects, but other key system data like:
		- variance (gaps in rule enforcement) & variance sources (gaps in system boundary allowing variance from other systems to leak in)
		- emerging objects
		- system errors & error-handlers
		- vertices (factors that generate or influence the system development), 
		- incentives (forces with a built-in reason lending it extra momentum/gravity pulling agents in that direction)
		- interface metadata (intent, pattern, types, function, etc)


## Intent-Matching

	- alternative index to system/object indexes
	- indexing objects in a system by intent allows for quick optimization


## Variance Analysis

	- this is the problem of adding/fitting/reducing structure from a gap in structure, which can be used to solve problems like prediction
	- reducing gaps in rule enforcement to shapes or paths has its own set of rules


## Transformation Analysis

	- this regards the potential to break down & format a problem into many different combinations of solved problems (optimal transport, linear algebra, etc) or known interfaces (type, intent)


## Info Object Index

	- on this index, a lot of human & biological problems (problems associated with sentient life) can be clarified
	- these objects are related to agents & their communication: perspective, strategy, decisions, intent, game, motivation


## Interface Network

	- this is the set of networks that act as useful filters for comparing metadata 
	- it can be a specific set for a specific problem space
		- the specific interface network for the debugging code space could be layers of network filters like:
			- dependencies
			- logic
			- side effects
			- types

	- the general interface network includes layers of network filters like:
		- intent (priority)
		- perspective (the unit filter object)
		- functions (can include patterns, strategies, rules, and any other set of operations/objects that has order)
		- structure
			- sub interfaces of structure include:
				- difference/position
				- shape
				- direction
		- concepts
		- types
