## Cancer & Stressors


  ### Predictive tools

    - prediction function for computing which pathogen combination will produce the target antibodies
    - prediction function for drug impact between species, mapping species transform function to changes in drug impact
    - prediction function for what ratio of compounds is present in nutrients & drugs with differing success rates
      https://phys.org/news/2016-07-happy-hormone-calcium-cows-humans.html
    - functionality prediction functions, indexing genes, structure & sub-components by functionality
    - examine expectation subversion (joke) functions for predictive power in cancer (like testing for signals/functionality)


  ### Theories

    - does cancer eventually try to build its own organ or bio-system, so letting a tumor survive for a period of time could trigger internal tumor immune processes?
      - tertiary lymphoid structures act as a regulatory system of the tumor, adjusting its pressure & distribution

    - support for stressor balance, matching, & allocation theory:

      - if resources are spent removing toxins like alcohol, fewer resources can be allocated to communication & other tasks that fight cancer
        https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/drug-addiction/health-concerns/

      - cell death => acetaldehyde => inflammation => cell communication
        - this could be part of why lack of stressor handler usage is linked to cancer
        - the cells in a certain organ, sub-system, or area arent being used, so they dont die from replacement with new cells
        - then the cell death => cell communication pathway isnt activated, and cell communication in that region is decreased, leaving the path clear for cancerous processes to spiral out of control


  ### Interfaces

    - attack points
      
      - causal level

        - attacking higher up the causal stack means attacking cancer's evolutionary & learning processes, so it cant evolve resistance to drugs

      - object level

        - attacking on the mutation level

          - how to trigger loss-of-function mutations of cancer mutations
          - how to trigger mutations of mutations (reverting to original state)
          - if chains of mutations are the combined trigger, can mutations be inserted in that chain to push it in another functional direction

      - system level

        - evaluate position as a variable (whether TADs & gene position & adjacent genes can be rearranged to prevent mutations)

        - evaluate alternative backups to commonly mutated genes/proteins/enzymes - how do you trigger functionality that evolves backups

        - genetic level

          - can genes producing a commonly mutated cancer-causing gene be adjusted to produce functionality without vulnerabilities exploited for cell division

        - functionality level

          - can system structure be changed so variance is increased & so functionality is allowed to accrete to produce backup functionality

        - signaling level 

          - 

    - system 

      - deviating from genetically optimal environments as a cause of systemic stressors that lead to cancer
        - if you have night owl genes but force yourself to be a morning person
        - if you have genes that can handle low calcium levels but you eat a lot of calcium
      - can you delegate computation to tumor cells to prevent them from splitting
      - cancer tends to make use of whatever tools already exist, which means its moves are predictable given available resource combinations
      - does cancer also have unpredictable activity in generating new tools, not just adjacent combinations of existing tools but systemic tools like new pathways?

      - from a system that has systemic issues that seem unexplainable by known rules, seek a new object (interface, system, rule, type, attribute, etc)

    - processes

      - mutations

        - compounding mutations can be chained with intent analysis to predict which function chains will cause cancer
          https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-02-cancer-years-diagnosis-earlier.html

        - of the cancers that dont have driver mutations that have been identified, the functionality can accrete randomly, given the host system structure allowing the functionality of cell division to occur

          - for a simplistic example, if the cancer-causing mutation had a triangular shape, then cancerous functionality could be generated by function chains forming a triangular shape, and could also emerge from a corner of the host system where unused functionality accreted

      - learning

      - competition

      - finding/borrowing/generating functionality & other resources

      - energy management (storage, sharing, production, source-switching, conversion)

      - emergent effects:

        - example of emergent effects 

          - there are intended & unintended ways to activate a process, such as cell death

            - apoptosis (cell stressor & stress-handler are aligned with limited side effects in the cell itself ignoring the outer system, as this is a granular function - it gets the signal to kill the cell, and it activates that process)

            - variance injection that triggers cell death in unintended ways (over supply of stressors for cell stress-handlers in ways that produce variance that disrupts the cell membrane from the inside)

            - acidity is a resource for this process, but it can also kill the cell if over-supplied

            - the synergy between histidine & the mechanism of this virus has multiple possible explanations:
              - the virus needed to use existing system resources to be able to attack host cells
              - the virus needed to use an inflammatory agent to hide its activity from immune system
              - the immune system evolved a cooperative process with viruses like this to promote inflammation in a cost-efficient way by delegating it to pathogens

            - examples of ways to generate the above list (and the full version):
              - examine relationships/processes for common priorities (efficiency, reducing cost, cooperation effects, inflammation response)
              - examine inputs/outputs (required resources)
              - examine labor/energy processing (cooperative can be parasitic or symbiotic, where one agent is delegating more labor to other agents, or where labor is being traded evenly)

            - you can permute the other interface objects & object attributes/rules to generate the full list of possible explanations, starting on the most explanatory interface and traversing to other interfaces based on available/derivable information

            https://phys.org/news/2020-02-chemists-unveil-influenza-protein.html

      - function types

        - explicit function (such as 'convert input energy into output structure')
        - implicit function (such as unintended side effects of outputs, interim functions between input/output, and unpredicted emergent functions at scale or across many linked integrated function chains)
        - provide resources used as inputs to activate other functions (a set of molecules that when detached can activate other processes)
        - connect functionality (binding structures)
        - provide platform for functionality (variance allowing functionality to develop on foundational structures)

      - organization (chromosome position, storage compression, topologically associated domains, binding/accretion rules)

        - shapes that have rotation-compounding structures (corners/wheels)
        - https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-01-inflammation-game-changer-cellular-death.html

      - communication

        - excess energy allows for acquiring extra resources (borrowing functionality from a bacteria farther away, spending more time computing something or testing variations)
          just like excess information is distributed according to thermodynamics

          - if energy is efficiently converted into information in a system (like the cancer system or the bacteria system) that system will require less energy & other inputs overall
            - such as the information of how to acquire information or switch energy sources

          - the distribution of structures within a cup of liquid can influence how quickly the energy dissipates

          - information dissipates according to common priorities like efficiency, but it can be overridden by concentrated energy, like when a cancer cell is surrounded by healthy cells so it shouldnt be able to produce legitimate semblance of signals, but if it has better energy usage (like functionality to acquire information as needed), it may be able to override the healthy cell communication, which is almost costless if they are adjacent neighbors in a circle around the cancer cell, but can still be beaten by more efficient energy storage (able to produce or find information as needed)

          - efficiency dissipates in similar ways - if one source process is efficient, other subsequent processes or attributes may also be more efficient - the efficiency dissipates or cascades through the system, possibly in a compounding way

          - energy can produce efficiency: the government of energy by rules like thermodynamics & chemistry has effects on subsequent process like information retrieval & position (communication & distribution) which can impact energy production

          - summary: 
            - concentrated energy produces information efficiently 
            - cancer cells often have concentrated energy in various formats like mutations, functionality, information, etc
            - the thermodynamics of energy impact how efficiency, communication, information, & other outputs of energy are distributed

          https://phys.org/news/2020-01-supercomputers-link-quantum-entanglement-cold.html

        - still relies on distribution of cells for cell communication (enough normal cells around mutated cell to block it from joining other mutated cells)
          and relies on the mutated cell not already having resources to exploit surrounding cells as energy sources

          - dishonest signals that provide some benefit to surrounding healthy cells (pay a toll/tax/bribe for safe passage) have a higher likelihood of preserving cancer growth

          - the advertisement is an inherently false signal that has filters/tests built-in to the bio system so that correct signals can get through

          - legitimate signals are likelier to be:
            - local (granular function)
            - verifiable on several metrics (where a false signal would fail)
            - no side effects that dont have handlers built-in (for example, they dont cause mutations or output toxins without handlers)

          - the reason the system has these filters is to avoid over-handling a stressor, as it occasionally has signals that look like stressors which it has to avoid over-handling, like how the immune response can look like a stressor when its a stress-handler, so these filters exist to make sure the distinction between those categories is determinable most of the time

          - these filters keep some openings functional, but these filters dont make every variance opening safe - for instance with energy sources, which there are few regulations on

          - the insight of the process is 'ensuring output of false signals is an input for legitimate cells to communicate'
