## Prediction markets

  - you can influence other people's predictions
    - providing prediction tools (algorithms, delivery platforms, APIs, tutorials)
    - tracking usage of those tools
    - indirect market manipulation, through trust established by making your prior predictions true
  - directly influence supply/demand & make bets on your influence


## Loan markets

  - interest rate is supposed to reflect lower rate than borrower ROI
  - aggregate loans by purpose
    - borrowers contribute borrowed funds & price information (how much theyd pay for a solution) to finance research to solve malaria/water cleaning problems that generate inability to pay
  - competition between loaners creates market for loans between loaners (tala owes m-pesa or vice versa)
  - optimal transport can be applied to create repayment groups
    - which borrowers can team up to repay which loans in which order to reduce overall interest rate

 ## Economic impact/contribution


    I. Solution creation (Job creation from value creation)

      - takes the form of releasing stored funds (previously uninvested liquid savings) to laborers, ideally to build a new solution out of created value (innovation)


    II. Problem switching (Job switch incentivization)

      - takes the form of creating an incentive to move from one labor type (low skill, automatable) to another (high skill, more complex)

        - this is what companies usually mean when they claim they "created jobs" - most of their new employees were already employed in other jobs, but the company decided that a project would make them more money than it cost to build, and that the net profit was worth offering a higher salary to these lower-skilled laborers that would incentivize them to switch jobs

          - so the net impact was not actually adding jobs to the economy, but incentivizing job switches
          - however, if the previous lower-skilled jobs are automated, then the total number of jobs in the economy is usually reduced 
            (unless all of the workers in the lower-skilled jobs had a 1:1 switch rate to new higher-skilled jobs, meaning no lower-skilled workers are unemployed after their jobs are automated)


    III. Problem allocation (Job distribution)

        - problems can be allocated by market forces, by resource limits (info access, skills limits, location, convenience), by inefficiencies/variance, and by automation/innovation
        - they can also be allocated artificially by organizations like companies/govts
    

    IV. Problem reduction (Job invalidation/reduction)

        - product demand reduction:
          - trend phases (if gardening becomes a popular hobby among hikers, replacing hiking activity, so hobby equipment demand changes from hiking equipment to gardening equipment)

        - labor demand reduction:
          - automation (less labor is necessary to solve the same problem because the solution was automated)


    V. Problem creation (Job increase)

        - labor demand increase without value-creation:

          - solution problems (more labor is necessary to solve the same problem because the solution was sub-optimal or incorrect)

            - example: if a vacuum robot starts eating cats, the robot company may have to hire more devs to fix the cat-eating problem, if its complex enough to not be coverable by their existing labor resources

            - this incentivizes devs to create problems to reduce their workload or ensure they have a steady supply of work, and disincentivizes value-creation

          - labor demand for a new job category is artificially created (with sub-optimal logic) that doesnt add value to the labor market or value of the product (project manager)

        - rent-seeking

          - existing resource distribution incentivizes artificial marketing of sub-optimal goods that dont add value to the market but rather allow the suppliers to engage in rent-seeking to build competitive moats:
            - platform dependency
            - user base dependency (addictive drugs, product component & version dependencies)
            - ad dependency to reach customers, vs. direct optimal matching of problem (info demand) and solution (info supply)

          - rent-seeking behavior is only justifiable when the company uses profits to create more benefits than they require in rent (rent-seeking profits invested in successful societal problem-solving)


    VI. Value maintenace

      - money: stored labor 

      - value: relative (stored or potential) labor

      - relative-value potential: the relative profit potential that can be made in a particular labor type

        - this can also be framed as the potential gains added by acquiring skills/understanding in a problem space
          - low-skilled laborers cant add much profit potential in an automated problem space, but high-skilled laborers can
          - whereas even low-skilled laborers can add some profit potential in a non-automated problem space
            - low-skilled task example: "identifying problem type" (still in demand because its not automated yet)
            - high-skilled task example: "automating identifying problem type"

        - example:

          - automated labor (such as checking the chemical content of a product before shipping it) has low relative-value potential because its rules are well-understood, so the profit potential approaches 0, unless a high-skilled worker can optimize the existing solution or derive abstract problem-solving methods
          - non-automated labor (like problem-solving) has high relative-value potential because its rules are not well-understood, so the profit potential is high


    VII. Value creation

      1. automation

        - reduces the amount of work necessary to solve the total set of problems

          - example:

            - if a society has problems "find medicine" and "clean water" and someone automates "clean water", then the only work remaining to solve that society's problems is in the "find medicine" problem
            - so the people who created the "clean water" automation tech have power (can charge exploitative prices for it), unless they decide to use ethical pricing or if the tech is distributed to everyone
            - the cost of water-cleaning will likely go down long term (if the clean water tech company abuses their power, theyll eventually be overthrown unless they can create economic moats)
            - therefore the remaining relative-value potential is in the other problem space "find medicine"
            - the "clean water" problem only has potential relative value in the form of potential optimizations to the existing clean water automation tech (unless they develop automation of that automation method, such as abstract problem-solving methods, in which case the potential relative value of labor in that field is re-routed to potential relative value in the "abstract problem-solving" problem)
            - the "find medicine" problem will be where most of the remaining job opportunities in the labor market are

        - each problem type within a context has a limit on the number of jobs it can create, if labor is organized optimally:

          - optimal labor organization requires understanding, checking foreseeable impact on system context, & automation: 
            - derive rules, check impact on system, then automate 
            - derive rule-derivation, system impact checking & automation rules, then automate

          - example:
            - if software engineering labor was organized optimally, there would be very few jobs (in the thousands) rather than 100s of millions of jobs, and they would involve code automation
            - if everyone wanted to be a farmer, there would only be so many farming jobs possible (given land resource constraints), and the number of jobs would steadily reduce as more farming tasks were automated
          
          - however abstract problem types (vs. specific jobs in a context like software engineering) create almost unlimited jobs, such as:
            - incentive alignment
            - mismatch correction
            - conflict resolution
            - system analysis

          - these abstract problem types will likely have innovation potential for a while, because theyre not automated yet, as there is potential for controversy in selecting optimal solution selection methods for those problem types, given that they need to be evaluated in a system context

      2. innovation

        - offers an opportunity for disrupting resource distribution
        - uses resources in a new way that is useful to some agent

      3. efficiency creation

        - organization

          - efficiencies of scale:
            - network effects from a scaled organization, such as a large company or an automation tool allowing scaled info trades, can provide compounding value 
              - example: chat tool to ask a question or suggest an idea to many people at once

        - optimization

          - finding a lower cost solution, where cost can be: a resource cost to agents, a distance from a priority, or cost in the form of systemic inefficiency/variance creation

        - abstraction

          - abstract efficiency objects (patterns, concepts, strategies)
