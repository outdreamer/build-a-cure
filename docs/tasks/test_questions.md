# questions to test system filters

  - why do phase shifts happen - bc of the ability for aggregated information to be measured as something else 
    - example: molecules identifiable as a set, data identifiable as a cluster, pattern identifiable as an emergency

  - what are the aggregate effects of many errors in selection of algorithms/parameters/processing/deployment - what phase shifts emerge from repeated or interacting error types?

  - why do you arrange dimensions at 90 degrees? to examine the full interaction space of all possible combinations of the two variables

  - why are polynomials with a leading coefficient of one & having optional zero coefficients capable of being multiplied & added to give the roots to the system of equations?

      - bc scaled versions (through multiplication) and combinations (through addition) can position leading coefficients to be 1 while also positioning trailing coefficients to be zero
      - is there a polynomial coefficient set that you cant multiply or add in a way that makes a coefficient in a position to be one and every coefficient after it except the solution coefficient to be zero? 
        no, bc that would mean the leading term cant be solved
      - once you have leading coefficients equal to one and the trailing coefficients equal to zero, the system is solved for each variable
      - why would you try to solve for each leading term in a matrix? bc they are ordered at that point (formatted to have the same positions in each row) and the solution is also ordered (on the right side)
        - using the concept of position to produce additional organization of information, you can benefit from the alignment of the variable positions by isolating each variable (transforming with multiplication & addition of coefficients until the variable solved for in each row has a coefficient of 1 and all other coefficients except the solution are zero)
