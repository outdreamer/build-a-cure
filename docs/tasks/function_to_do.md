# to do

  - structures
    - concept of attention in structures
      - mixed interim high-variation & high-similarity structures tend to maximize attention
    - examine conflating intent & requirement
    - consciousness as choice to move between neural nodes (rather than being directed) required:
      - the development of alternative node paths performing equal/similar functions, requiring:
        - the development of excess resources, delaying required decision time (making immediate decision unnecessary, avoiding a forced decision), requiring:
          - the existence & application of previous efficiencies & functions for alternative evaluation, energy storage, storage-checking, & energy requirement-identifying
      - the cause could be framed as structures such as an 'efficiency stack' or 'energy maintenance functions' or 'alternative options' or 'navigation/motion control' or 'lack of requirement/need'
    - examine similarity (alignment/overlap) structures between: 
      - extremely different components (when an error type is an incentive or a function used for other intents) 
        - when the solution format of some problem has similarities to the error type, like when you need randomness so errors generating randomness are a possible function to use for that intent
        - contradictory/opposite components (have some metric in common, with opposite values)

  - finish organizing lists of examples, functions, info objects (insight paths, definitions, questions), components for configuration

    - organize examples
      - label examples so they can be queried more structurally
      - query for logic in examples when implementing functions
      - organize examples of useful structures & questions in index.md
        - identify useful questions in notes
        - check reduced language components for any other useful functions (what terms cant be adjacently, clearly & accurately framed in terms youve defined) for completeness

  - examine calculation errors from one partitioning method vs. other methods, & a function to balance their contribution to error to select an optimal partitioning method for an accuracy level
    - a way around the discrete vs. continuous dichotomy is combinations: 
      - discrete counts of continuous compositions (overlaps, layers, components)

  - use isolatability/inevitability/uniqueness as a structural foundation for interface conversion/generation logic

    - identify 'inevitable' definition routes that are unique which can be used as a default generation intent for the core data included for app functionality
      - example: a definition route that cant be used as a definition of both balance & power, just one
      - unique intents are also a useful foundation structure for the intent interface

    - apply structures to overlaps in definition routes
      - find the adjacent structure without contradictions, that doesnt resolve to either specific option, within the limits of both definition routes
        - lack/limit :: resource 
        - function :: resource 
          - resource-generating function :: resource
            - resource :: function

  - identify structures (like contradictions & distortions from expected normal) as input to info type generation algorithm

  - examine the distortion vector paths that adjacently decompose a data set into a prediction function from a base point/function set

  - add to decision points
    - when a method & data set can be determined to be capable of deriving the answer to a prediction function problem

  - de-duplicate logic
    - organize interface analysis logic definitions
      - organize functions in problem/interface definitions, before organizing functions in implementations/*
    - integrate problem_solving_matching.md
    - integrate find/apply/build/derive logic from system_analysis/ & maps/defs*.json
    - separate interface analysis logic into implementation/functions (functions dont need unique info)
    - add functions from workflows & analysis (to do list, questions answered, problems solved, interface definition & functions) as files in functions/ folder
      - organize into primary core functions & list sample parameters (like objects to identify for the identify function)

    - integrate rules from diagrams in patent applications to relevant documents
          
  - using set theory in query operations:
    - edges as core organizing/formatting operations (find/apply) & interfaces (connecting/explanatory concepts/functions)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph


## examples

  - give example of mapping to structures & identifying contradictions its safe to ignore for applying a structure

  - example of permuting assumption: "reports of power consumption have to be exact measurements" 
    - a temperature monitor sensitive to a hundredth of a degree might provide similar but non-specific power reporting for important/extreme usage patterns without revealing such specific information as that which could infer exact operations being done, bc the interval of temperature measurements allows for greater variation in calculations that could explain it

  - finish dilemma problem type example formats
  
  - query examples for use cases like:
    - lack of information stored (match problem of type 'information lack' with interface query 'check pattern interface for similar patterns')
    - query problem breakdown & integration diagram
    - calculating various different problem breakdown strategies first before executing normal query-building logic for each
  
  - add examples of system/object/rule/type change patterns
  
  - include example workflows with example problems
    - include example of how to generate other workflows (different starting/ending points & trajectories)


## diagram
  
  - diagram with error types
  - diagram of the network of formats
  - make efficiency map
  - diagram of alternate interfaces (information = combination of structure, potential, change or structure, cause or structure, system)
  
  - give structural query example diagram for GANs + image compression problem

  - chart type: overlaying multiple 2-dimension variable comparisons to identify common shapes of variable connections (density of points added with a visible attribute like more opacity)

  - finish core function structure example diagrams

  - diagram with joke types
    - 'annoying when they bring up human rights in a conversation'
      - conversation system context
        - functions
          - change topic 
            - change topic structure (sequence)
              - introduce a topic (first time topic is included in conversation)
          - expected interaction functions
            - criticism of a behavior
              - 'conversation with dictator' system context
                - criticism of power abuse (law violation, specifically human rights violation, which are a related object to dictators)
                  - interpreted as right in the 'conversation with dictator' system context
                    - expected interaction in this context
                      - 'should bring up human rights to a criminal'
            - norms:
              - for low-stakes interactions & interaction errors (manners, annoyance, disrespect)
            - laws: 
              - for high-stake interactions & interaction errors (rights violations)
        - placing a norm (or related objects) in the place where a law (or related objects) would normally go:
          - 'its annoying when someone doesnt let you end the conversation'
            - 'its annoying when someone keeps going on & on about your previous conversations where you ordered deaths of a dissident'
              - 'its annoying when someone keeps going on & on about your previous conversations where you ordered deaths of a dissident for being annoying & then abruptly stops without explanation'
            - 'its rude when someone doesnt let you end a conversation with a laywer interrogating you for war crimes' 

  - diagram for structures of emergence
    - example: 1-1 input/output relationship up an interaction layer, where extra resources that dont dissolve immediately on the higher interaction layer aggregate & form core structures like combinations, where interactions between combinations & sequences have different dynamics than the individual output interacting with other individual outputs
    - emergent functionality/attributes come from interaction structures (sequences & layers)

    - add diagram for intent-matching
    - add structures to diagram: interface overflow (to sub-interfaces), interface foundation
    - diagram for workflow 1: 
      - function to determine relevance filter ('functions', 'required') from a problem_step ('find incentives') for a problem definition, to modify problem_steps with extra functions/attributes ('change_position') to be more specific to the problem definition ('find_incentives_to_change_position') for problem_steps involving 'incentives', so you know to use the function_name to modify the problem step if it's between the type 'functions' and the object searched for 'incentives'
    - add conceptual math interface query diagram
      - use lattice multiplication as standard example, other than core operations (add/multiply mapped to language, concepts like irreversibility/asymmetry mapped to math)
    - interface conversion, matching, starting point selection (applying structure, checking if relevant information is found)
    - diagram to document sub-functions of core functions with distortions
    - make diagram for dimension links higher than 3d that are depictable in the same network space
      - should show variables that impact other variables, the change rates of these relationships
      - overall impact should be calculatable from these relationships
      - should show similar movements for correlated variables
      - should show skippable/derivable variables (variables that can be resolved later than they normally are)
      - should show meta forces for overall trends in change rules (direction of combined variable forces)
      - should show limits of measurability & threshold metrics

    - diagrams for specific concepts, core functions, concept operations (combine, collide, connect, merge, apply), ethical shapes
        - variable accretion patterns (how an object becomes influenced by a new variable, complex system interaction patterns, etc)
        - make diagram of potential matrix to display the concept
          - map parameter sets to potential matrix shapes 
        - finish diagrams for cause (shapes & ambiguity), concept (evolution of concepts, networks, distortion functions)
        - diagram for argument
      - make a system layer diagram for each interface to allow specification of core interfaces & other interface layers (interface interface)
        - make a system layer diagram for structures to include layers of structures 
          (beyond core structures like curves, to include n-degree structures like a wave, as well as semantic output structures like a key, crossing the layer that generates info structures like an insight, a probability, etc)

    - map variable structures to prediction potential for problem types, given ratio of equivalent alternate signals

    - vertex variable structures
      - quantum physics, prediction/derivation tools, build automation tools, testing tools, learning/adaptation tools, system rules, computation power are all vertex variables of information - they can generate/derive/find information
      - which structure (sequence, network, set, or cycle) of vertex variables is most efficient

    - add to markets:
      - examine net effect of competition on markets
        - does allowing companies to fail have a net negative effect thats biggest on the risk (insurance/debt) industries, organization/analysis (ratings, group investing), info markets, govt industry, or is the negative effect exported to other countries or used as an input (legal precedent, example to use for future legislation) or do negative effects continue to be transferred to end-nodes of debt chains (those oppressed by stacked inequalities)

    - add to internet optimizations: add local data backup centers to cache copies of critical data just like backup electricity generators to methods of recovering or rebuilding crashed systems with alternate data sources

    - add to govt:

    - finish core component metadata
      - identify any missing attributes/functions that cant be reduced further
        - example: 
          - everything that exists (has structure, either implied or verified) has an opposite/different version, so 'opposite' is a core attribute
          - everything that has structure can be verified to some degree, so 'verifiability' is a core attribute

# content/config

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths (info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight', system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub')
    - define default & core objects necessary for system to function (out of the box, rather than minimal config necessary to derive other system components & assemble)
      - add default functions to solve common problem types
      - alternate utility function implementations have variation potential in the exact operations used to achieve the function intents, but there are requirements in which definitions these functions use because they are inherent to the system. For example, the embodiment may use a specific definition of an attribute (standardized to a set of filters) in order to build the attribute-identification function using a set of filters - but the general attribute definition is still partially determined in its initial version by requirements specified in the documentation, such as a set of core attribute types (input, output, function parameter, abstract, descriptive, identifying, differentiating, variable, constant), the definition of a function, and the definition of conversion functions between standard formats.
    - document time structures (concave time explaining compounding similarities up to a point of maximum concavity, a structure that can separate from the other space-times)
    - systematize your definitions of info objects, to include analysis that produces relationships of core objects like opposites to their relevant forms (anti-symmetry) in addition to permuted object states (asymmetry), such as an anti-strategy, anti-information, anti-pattern
      - organize certainty (info) vs. uncertainty objects (potential, risk, probability)
      - make doc to store insight paths, counterintuitive functions, hidden costs, counterexamples, phase shift triggers
      - add technicality, synchronization, bias, counterintuition, & certainty objects leading to inevitable collisions
        - the collision of compounding forces producing a phase shift
        - lack of attention in one driver and false panic in a second driver leading to a car crash given the bases where their processes originate
      - define alignment on interfaces (compounding, coordinating, parallel, similar, etc)
      - start with these info object transforms that filter the most info: opposite, invalidating, symmetric, core, aligning, boundary-breaking, phase shift activating, structure stabilizing, constant changing, converging
      - add core info objects (core strategies, core assumptions) so you can make a network of graphs for a system
    - concept analysis:
      - how new concepts (gaps in network rules) evolve once structure is applied to prior concepts 
    - interface analysis:
      - limitations of interfaces & how to derive them
      - how rules develop on stability & how foundations are connected & destroyed
      - explainability as a space limited by derivable attributes from data set & cross-system similarity
      - vertex definition & give examples (as an intersection/combination of interface variables, such as determining/description(compressing)/generative/causative/derivation variables), around which change develops
    - change analysis:
      - generated object change types
        - constant to variable
        - variable to removal of assumption in variable type/data type

    - examine implementing your solution type (constructing structures (made of boundary/filter/resource sets) to produce substances like antibodies, using bio system stressors)
    
    - resolve & merge definitions into docs/tasks/implementation/constants/definitions.json

    - update links

    - integrate archive_notes/finder_info/functions
