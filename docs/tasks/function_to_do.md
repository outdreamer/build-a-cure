# to do

  - summary of advice

    - invest based on:

      - prioritizing real value signals: 
          - products that fulfill a need
          - companies that self-invest (prioritizing growth by re-investing in growth)
          - leaders that guide by example
          - independence: invest in independent value sources & independence-generating assets, become an independent self-supplier of your required inputs
          - understanding: invest in assets you understand
          - established/proven (long-term) value
          - efficiency: take responsibility for your required inputs

      - avoiding false value signals: 
        - incentives: high-reward/low-cost reasons to invest that may not align with real value or be sub-optimal dynamics that destroy value in a different position of the system 
          - speculation
          - investment banker advice
          - ceo status
          - short-term value changes

  - future value signals

    - problem metrics: current problem-solution ratio, problem to problems-solved ratio
      - solution metrics: 
        - efficiency: sustainability, reusability, cost-benefit ratio
        - independence: self-generatability, self-awareness/regulation/correction
    - efficiency-generating metrics: 
      - integration/organization/optimization/regulation/generalization
    - info distribution (across teams, departments, ranks, customers, other businesses)
    - info proxy derivation/acquisition/building
      - education
      - group membership (do they outsource some processing to groups, and which ones, and how do they evaluate groups like partners/clients/competition)
      - understanding
        - group dynamics (do they help toxic groups improve, do they have a self-destruct mechanism if they become a toxic group, etc)
        - markets (do they organize & optimize markets to achieve their goals quicker)
      - flexibility or learning potential (intelligence derivation/generation/acquisition/building)

  - diagram with error types

  - give example of the network of formats

  - make efficiency map
  
  - abstract risk insurance: guarantee a relative position (without specific currencies or amounts), such as 'resources giving a top 10% economic position'

  - finish applying structure to info components (memory components like personality, forgetting, compression, uniqueness, generation, learning, bias, and organization components like relevance, differences, type, abstraction, standards, randomness) to generate full set of neural net types
    - filter by usage intent

  - check reduced language components for any other useful functions (what terms cant be adjacently, clearly & accurately framed in terms youve defined) for completeness

  - gauge theory definition: field where the difference in kinetic & potential energy doesnt change locally from a symmetry in the form of certain continuous (differentiable) sets with multiplication/division operations
    - find interface boundaries by how its definition & structures break down
    - find gaps in interfaces by points of variation not covered by other interfaces

  - why not call interfaces a system? 
    - everything can be formatted as a system, not everything is an interface - an interface is like a location where different systems can meet to communicate

  - science: 
    - alternatives
      - a limit on potential energy in the universe, concentrated in space-time moves or symmetry violations, where all other changes align with the standard model
      
    - examine muons as a reflective surface or temporary boundary for electrons to use to avoid violating symmetry, where artificial experiment conditions or other muons can interfere with planned reflection, leading to an imbalance in particle ratios that would occur with distributed/isolated particle pairs

  - chart type: overlaying multiple 2-dimension variable comparisons to identify common shapes of variable connections (density of points added with a visible attribute like more opacity)

  - assess fair use of copied code by:
    - how much effort it would have been to not copy (if its low-effort to not copy, there's no reason to copy)
    - ratio of value contributed by those lines (such as by the cost of bugs caused by distorting the line)
    - difficulty (cognitive distance) of inventing that product given what had been invented prior to that
    - ratio of total value that the code can generate (what other software can it generate, what can it automate)

  - anti-stupidity addiction counseling & meditation app, fixing addictions with incrementally slightly less evil replacements:
    - racism by convincing them there are non-racial groups that deserve hatred more ("hey Sharon, you're so right about the Jews, they absolutely cared about covering up their space weapons program enough to serve you that ad about fun outdoor non-genocide activities in your area, but you know who I hate more - wiccans with vegan pets" could be all it takes to wean Sharon off of her ethnic hatred so she can write manifestos about the behaviors she hates instead)
    - jealousy, by convincing them there are other people more deserving of jealousy, such as people who don't feel it bc they're the best ("my dearest Beatrice, rather than trying to criminalize your male coworkers complimenting someone else, dare I suggest developing intelligence so you can create any asset your heart desires" can fix Beatrice so she fulfills her destiny of being the recipient of increasingly & unnecessarily dramatic letters)
    - false hope that their new accessory, new dance move, brow grooming technique, or another just barely acceptable trait is giving everyone the jels ("have mercy Kevin, your false eyelashes are murdering our will to live, an asset that is literally necessary for life, which is technically murder" could inspire Kevin to dim his own light to let others shine for once, since absolutely everything is able to kill someone's will to live, if you just wish on a shooting star & believe & if theyre a total dweeb hurt by everything)
    - victim complex, convincing them there are actual problems, and that they have actual power to fix the illusory problems they think they're a victim of ("oh my god, are you ok? why is the red cross trying to help sex trafficking & genocide victims, when that cake just forced you to eat it?" could alert Pamela to the fact that she does in fact have superpowers instead of victimhood, powers like fixing her impulse control (the stronger she'll be to strangle us), or alternatively, her priorities (the better to crucify us with)
    - god complex, convincing them that they are not in fact allowed to murder other people who happen to exist, which they take as an intentional malicious reminder about their own mistakes ("no Lisa, someone else having something out of your intellectual price range is not justification for altering international human rights terminology just this once to justify what you did to them" could be the wake-up call Lisa needed to acknowledge her own limitations)
    - judging addiction, where they act like anyone trusts their judgment and thinks they're incapable of hypocrisy ("sure Chrissy, we'll punish all your victims youre jealous of who did nothing to you, we totally trust that you're not jealous of them, since you only told us to punish them bc you want the best for us, in your infinite wisdom, not bc you think that if we can't interact with them, we'll someday start to think you're great")
    - lying addiction, where they say stuff that is clearly false bc they think its "play pretend" time all the time and pointing out lies is "violating the social contract" in some way ("sure Chrissy, youre saying we should all have kids bc you think its the right thing to do, not bc you want every woman's body to be ruined" might trigger a thought in Chrissy's mind, like that she might not be great at hiding her intentions, which are a shade less complicated & interesting than she claims)
    - self-nominating sainthood of their own religion, where they act holy & concerned about their homicide victims so they make sure to check their email every day in case today is the day they need to act sad about their victims' deaths ("sure Martha, that bake sale almost ended all oppression & inequality - it's like you invented something that changed the world and made all problems trivial to solve, but slightly different in that your strategy didn't work bc people persecuted you for being better than them (at pretending decorating cookies is the only thing that has ever mattered)" might alert Martha to the possibility of other strategies to seem good, like actually being good)

  - finish poc & give other examples applying different workflows

  - self-explaining AI test: able to identify metadata that align with its decision path, like:
    - thresholds
    - alternatives (selected & unselected based on thresholds)
    - testing points (gather info about relative value to threshold)
    - types/clusters
    - examples
    - statistics like average examples within a type

  - finance: assess value of prior work by work that is still relatively valuable, incentivizing new work

  - alternative intent coordination & compatability of metrics

    - calculating interactivity by coordinating/adjacent/convertible structures

  - use exclusively ai with known biases & error types so output can be corrected with logic from the associated solution type
    - algorithms that dont have a mechanism to offset/correct biases from data can be used with a correcting function to improve output likelier to be an error type
    - this is an interim solution (algorithm/model + correcting logic of error types) while other algorithms are tested
    - every algorithm has limitations - those with known limitations can be an asset in some problem types (like to discover biases in data), while other algorithms with unknown limitations can be an asset in other problem types (like to add uncertainty or delegate responsibility for unfair decisions)

  - integrate related AI models within the same network of variables to derive functionality 
    - if you have an AI model to predict relationships between causally sequential variable sets A/B/C, D/E/F, and G/H/I, apply the connecting variable set models (A/B/C and G/H/I) to create a logical function to connect inputs/outputs of the D/E/F variable AI model (or a subset of variables), as a filter to streamline output of the model in response to changes to relevant to data & variables
      - this is an alternative to training a model on D/E/F in isolation, & updating it by training it on new data received
      - not only should it be able to identify the dependent variable value with accuracy, it should be able to fit into the network of relevant variables, connecting other related variable sets (A/B/C and G/H/I)
      - this may offer the possibility of skipping modeling D/E/F at all, if A/B/C is predictive of G/H/I on its own in the target range of accuracy, but at least will offer extra validation potential of D/E/F model inputs/outputs, and may provide core functions/structures (generalizers, thresholds, filters) to use in building the reduced stabilized logical form of the D/E/F model on-demand
      - answers the questions:
        - 'given A/B/C and G/H/I models, does D/E/F make sense'
        - 'can a reduced stable logical form of DEF be derived from ABC & GHI, and does this logical form match DEF, and to what degree'
        - 'why a variable is useful to predict another', not just 'if a variable is useful to predict another', since knowing 'why' will help the model adapt when that reason changes

  - concept of attention in structures
    - mixed interim high-variation & high-similarity structures tend to maximize attention

  - examine conflating intent & requirement

  - finish core function structure example diagrams

  - vpn's & proxy servers to enable protection functions (viewing science research or medical info) by: 
    - automatically finding countries with laws allowing those protected functions & routing requests from servers in those locations
    - finding a version of an app that has target features so user is directed to download for that versions

  - successful AI would identify multiple solutions as probably successful, once variables of inequality are identified

    - interface query structure (sequence)

      - query: identify 'value' as the vertex variable

      - query: identify input variables determining value: 
        - location
          - what is a low-method to change location: public transportation
          - what is a barrier to change location: visa, lack of info
        - proximity to supply chains
          - make an alternative supply chain between high-traffic suppliers/demands in other direction (across continent rather than across an ocean)
        - relevant cost ratios (cost of going somewhere, finding job, selling something, finding info)

      - query: apply function & intent interfaces
        - find functions for intent 'transfer resources'
          - temporary markets (tasks that will probably be automated within n years, markets for goods people probably wont want/need in n years, or only need once, or only while a law is applied that will be changed soon, or products that need a connecting product until theyre all invalidated by another product being built)
          - supply chains
          - transportation
          - delivery services

      - query: find relevant interfaces
        - laws
        - code
        - resource distribution
        - location

      - query: find solution methods
        - connect existing resources
        - apply multiple high-difference solutions, vary them to find subsets & versions that work

      - query: find lowest-cost combination of solutions
        - finding highest-value public transportation infrastructure to build (what routes would allow low-cost resource transfer for the most agents)
        - finding temp markets (delivery/resource-sharing/education services)
        - finding adjacent/existing law combinations to benefit the most low-income agents
        - finding adjacent/existing bugs or code loopholes to benefit the most low-income agents

      - query: organize info into a combination solution
        - example of a combination solution, integrating multiple relevant interfaces, solutions, covering a high ratio of input variables to vertex variable
          - 'investing in delivery businesses near planned supply chain routes offering a high-traffic alternative route, and relocation or transportation infrastructure to enable lower-cost market participation with subsidized education for delivery workers to help them get better jobs and leave their jobs open for immigrants'

  - consciousness as choice to move between neural nodes (rather than being directed) required:
    - the development of alternative node paths performing equal/similar functions, requiring:
      - the development of excess resources, delaying required decision time (making immediate decision unnecessary, avoiding a forced decision), requiring:
        - the existence & application of previous efficiencies & functions for alternative evaluation, energy storage, storage-checking, & energy requirement-identifying
    - the cause could be framed as structures such as an 'efficiency stack' or 'energy maintenance functions' or 'alternative options' or 'navigation/motion control' or 'lack of requirement/need'

  - example of applying interfaces to derive metadata about a component
    - apply causal interface to identify connecting function 'power is responsibility' (also an insight)
      - power can be defined in causal interface components as 'causative potential' (its the input reason for change in a system, including changes preventing changes)
        - given that it has structure 'change input', its also a source of other change types than intentionally triggering the correct function (errors, side effects, changes to errors)
        - changes to fix errors are related to the concept of 'responsibility' (definable as 'work that isnt incentivized but is necessary')
    - apply structural interface to identify connecting function 'power is responsibility'
        - 'aligning error & fix sources' also corrects the 'power source distribution imbalance' error, which is another way to derive this insight, using the structural interface (correct distribution imbalance with alignment)
        - identifying the 'similarity' (a core component of structural interface, applied during a standard application of interface) in the 'direction' structure, between power & side effects (including errors) as similar to the direction between power & fixes
        - identifying connecting functions positioning power as an input/required structure to fixing errors:
          - identifying that 'fixing functions' have an input trigger requirement like any other function, and function triggers therefore have power to fix errors
          - identifying that if something can generate a 'fixing function', it necessarily has power
          - identifying that if power is necessary to change a structure, by process of elimination, nothing else could fix an error

  - examine similarity (alignment/overlap) structures between 
    - different components (when an error type is an incentive, or a function used for other intents)
      - contradictory/opposite components

  - organize list of structures relevant for intents
    - for 'identify' intent, relevant structures include structures of difference (filters) and uniqueness (unique identifiers)
    - for 'connection' intents (identify/generate connection), a structure where components are only defined in terms of other components (by their relationships to other components), like a network or vector space
    - for 'differentiation' intents, a structure where the definition of difference is clear & applicable (can differentiate all different components)

  - grassroots citizen info tech & citizen journalism as an alternative to top-down govt law enforcement, where centralized/organized govt law enforcement is allocated when a metric threshold for citizen reports is reached
    - the correct position of govt is an automated tool usable by citizens to solve problems (prevent crime, enforce laws, exact justice)

  - example of multiple structural filters to reduce solution space
    - example of where a structural similarity could be used as an initial filter (in a dog vs. cat categorization algorithm)
      - find similarity to type 'dog' and type 'cat'
        - in cases where similarities point to equivalent probabilities for each category, apply additional filtering structures than similarities
          - apply base structures (random, core, common, etc)
            - apply path structures (how many steps from a base to produce a clear answer)
          - apply opposite structures (what is not a cat, what is not a dog)
          - apply filtering structures (both/neither) - (what are cats/dogs both or neither of)
          - apply structures of difference (what comes from a different origin/cause, like causes of evolving dog functions)
          - apply state/time structures (could this become a dog or could it have been a dog previously according to definitive attributes/functions)
          - apply variance structures (does this have variance from the cat base or following cat variance patterns)
          - apply agency/group structures (what groups do cats belong to or which groups are they found with)
          - apply system structures (what contexts normally go with 'cat')
          - apply change/distortion structures (what distortions are often applied to cats or dogs)
              - apply alternative path structures & network structure
                - how many different paths could this data produce a dog category? (how to get to 'dog' answer using that particular data)
                  - apply boundary structures in network (cat type path set or path region, dog type path set or path region)
                    - re-apply similarity structures to boundaries (is this within the cat path region)
                    - apply pattern structures (does this match cat path patterns)

  - usb that stores os/state/processes/files so when you take it out, all thats left is hardware, so secure portable destructible readonly sessions (or sessions allowing only one write at a time, from a user-facing process like a document editor, with regular approval requests to re-authenticate writes or session) can take place
  
  - organize examples of logic for functions (interface query design logic)

  - add functionality (or associated attributes) with components with base/core functions included, components which can be connected with user-defined functions
    - this can add functionality to products to reduce need for producing new versions
    - physical sensors can use communications tech with varying required internet infrastructure (beacons/bluetooth/radio) to integrate with data, computers, physical resources, building blocks of robots
    - physical components examples:
      - use a sensor added to non-electric or non-AI-driven vehicles, pedestrians, & other moving objects on roads (animals, robots) to detect other objects or sensors & help avoid crashes by attaching sensor output as input to steering mechanism with a steering component (interim tech while waiting on market capture of EV & AI vehicles)
        - can also be used to turn a cart or anything with wheels into a delivery robot, to reduce human traffic
        - this can turn the delivery market into a sensor coding market to add functionality/integrations to sensors & the robots or resources controlled by them
      - use a sensor (indicating position to lift away from) as input to another sensor (lifting sensor) with connecting function (fetch position to move away from, direct lift away from position, initiate lift)
        - add sensors with user-defined connecting functions & prioritized sensor functions
          - if a sensor on top of trash can has function "lift" and can take input like "heat motion in range", add user-defined connecting function to another sensor not on lid that the sensor on top can use as a reference point to find direction to move in (away from other sensor) 
    - code components/functions
      - user-defined connecting function like "query regularly for a function that can do this (publish, copy, export, search, build), and when found, add to querying component"
      - find connecting function like 'abstraction' to add functionality like 'handling other inputs' or attributes like 'flexibility' and distribute flexibility to other accessible components
      - hook a search function component up to input component (filters) using user-defined connecting functions (input filters to search on)
      - user-defined connecting function to connect components like core functions/scripts/metrics (when this event occurs in the sensory input function, send signal to trigger other function)
        - this is a way to abstract code (any function that can receive input data of that type) & code connections, delegating execution to code located with queries (find a function of this type or with this input/output) and modularize code as well as making it more connectible
    - task: identify the core functions/components that can generate required functionality for most user intents without introducing security flaws (making hacking devices less adjacently buildable than common legitimate use cases)

  - function-usage-intent::output or demand::supply combination/merging/building/matching functions (alternatively formatted as a solution-finding query for a problem or lack-resource matching function) as an alternative solution to ads

  - finish lists:
    - interface implementation problem type structures (suboptimal interface queries, incomplete definition routes, sub-optimal or mismatched formats) 
    - implementation variables as config options (different generation starting point/source of truth, equivalent/different voting influence in determining interface queries or system optimizations, different constants/derived info/functions, different default interfaces/definitions, etc)
    - core problem type structures (reduction, expansion, organization, matching, standardization, regulation, prediction/derivation (missing info), limit/change conflict resolution, error-to-resource conversion, optimization) & optimal formats & format structures for each
      - optimal optimization formats include network path-finding
      - optimal reduction/expansion formats include change type isolation as shape dimensions after structural assignment of problem attributes
      - optimal organization formats include layered networks & vertex variables

  - add to definitions
    - valid: having reason/logic/info supporting why it would be true, without higher-validity contradiction (info, more valid logic with higher support:contradiction ratio or higher applicability)
    - games (metric optimization, input/output link finding) 
      - games applying system context (metric selection) & function (function building) as a source of interfaces
    - important decisions as changes that are limited, clear & necessary (two options to change direction rather than 360 degrees of direction change options)
      - calculating decision metadata (optimal decision given intent, optimal decision across intents, least risky/causal decisions, alternative/equivalent decisions) can reduce the solution space of likely decisions
      - rather than predicting just using user decision history/incentives, predict using system incentives present in the decision-generating limits & indicated in decision metadata
    - integration/organization structures
      - give example of structures (like alignments, positions, directions) necessary to integrate structures of organization
        - organization structures are methods of organizing information (like neural architecture, information networks, OS)
        - as organization systems become integrated (like "applying an OS to machine learning networks to intercept/replace/validate bio system functionality"), their differences in structures like position and their organization & optimization structures will cause problems that are less predictable than other problems
          - example: applying a 'separation of functionality' structure to folders like occurs on an OS to a machine learning network structure may produce errors like 'separation of function & intent', which can be sub-optimal for tasks like 'identifying optimization metrics'
            - if this is further complicated by integration into a system as complex as the bio-system (for example by using that OS/network organization structure integration to filter & allocate sensory input information), it could cause less predictable errors, like misidentifying a bio system interface

  - add structural queries to insight paths
    - alignments present in security innovations (like alignment in inputs like keys)
    - source of rule development as structures of conflict between forced interactions like change causes & constant structures like limits
      - incomplete inevitability of interaction as a decision structure
    - other examples  
      - group device history authentication: authenticate credit card by proximity to cell phone & continuity applied to user usage history pattern

  - functionalize insight paths & integrate functions in optimized program with parameters to select function subset & structure for input problem
    - give parallel/perpendicular insight path examples, for insight paths that add info that the other is less/more likely to retrieve

  - new insight-fitting algorithm for error type avoidance
    - when a new discovery is made, apply insight paths formatted as questions to spot error types before they occur
      - could this violate any assumptions/requirements/dependencies we rely on for other tasks like calculations or applying systems of understanding
      - could this cause cascading (self-sustaining) errors
      - could this cause emergent errors, given other knowledge like probably interactive trends or rules
      - what are triggers of this? what can it trigger with certain interactions, how likely are those interactions

  - diagram with joke types
    - 'annoying when they bring up human rights in a conversation'
      - conversation system context
        - functions
          - change topic 
            - change topic structure (sequence)
              - introduce a topic (first time topic is included in conversation)
          - expected interaction functions
            - criticism of a behavior
              - 'conversation with dictator' system context
                - criticism of power abuse (law violation, specifically human rights violation, which are a related object to dictators)
                  - interpreted as right in the 'conversation with dictator' system context
                    - expected interaction in this context
                      - 'should bring up human rights to a criminal'
            - norms:
              - for low-stakes interactions & interaction errors (manners, annoyance, disrespect)
            - laws: 
              - for high-stake interactions & interaction errors (rights violations)
        - placing a norm (or related objects) in the place where a law (or related objects) would normally go:
          - 'its annoying when someone doesnt let you end the conversation'
            - 'its annoying when someone keeps going on & on about your previous conversations where you ordered deaths of a dissident'
              - 'its annoying when someone keeps going on & on about your previous conversations where you ordered deaths of a dissident for being annoying & then abruptly stops without explanation'
            - 'its rude when someone doesnt let you end a conversation with a laywer interrogating you for war crimes' 

  - example of applying structure to components like technologies to find emergent trends

    - multi-player video game voting: applying voting tech of viewers to influence video game tactics/resources/problems/outcomes/decisions
      - generative query: switch input of decisions to another decision-producing tool (audience voting vs. player/algorithm decisions), for randomness/customization/reality integration intents
    - user character customization: applying AI to generate characters of real people or characters from other games to play as other players in video game
      - generative query: switch input of character personality/story with another source of that info, for customization/reality integration intents
    - memory-generated vidoe game: apply ai & brain-scanning to generate a game based on memories
      - generative query: change experience level or skills required (use memory as a tool or test memory functionality), for testing/customization/reality integration intents
    - emotional/sensory alignment games: query for desired emotional path & map a game/video/audio/drug to produce or match that path
      - generative query: change content-creation direction & other variables, from story => emotions to emotions => structure applied to emotion-triggering tools
    - brain-development games: apply AI & brain-scanning to identify missing functionality in brains & generate game to develop that function
      - generative query: use output of game (learning) as input assumption for learning intents using games as intent-fulfillment resource

  - diagram for structures of emergence
    - example: 1-1 input/output relationship up an interaction layer, where extra resources that dont dissolve immediately on the higher interaction layer aggregate & form core structures like combinations, where interactions between combinations & sequences have different dynamics than the individual output interacting with other individual outputs
    - emergent functionality/attributes come from interaction structures (sequences & layers)

  - calculate deaths caused by products/companies by proportional contribution to deaths from slavery & pollution/plastic/additive/medicine & other chemicals

  - generate other interfaces with interface components (connection, requirement, structure, abstraction, set, independence)

    - cause: preceding inevitability requirement in sequential structure
    - function: structure of task structures (conditions, assignments, iterations) consistently connecting input & output

    - potential: structures like combinations not certainly excluded by requirements
    - change: difference in an attribute value, according to a base (time, relative change, change type)
    - abstraction: general pattern of a specific structure set
    - pattern: a set of connecting functions, often in a sequence structure
    - structure: connections & change of measurable change & difference types
    - information: specific description of a structure
    - math: description-connecting functions
    - system: structure of independence, often having boundary, function & other component structures, at a particular interaction level

  - platform to apply a portfolio of AI models to price a stock given private company data like available resources, internal analysis, & implementation plans & publish the ai-generated prices, with comparative historical pricing of other companies using similar data pre-ipo or valuation, as an offset to price pumping & other forms of misrepresentation

  - identify accidental & intentional govts/laws/markets, based on function metadata concepts

    - relevance (restricting info only to functions that need it)
    - structure (functionality gaps)
    - potential (analyzing future functionality and paths to those states)

    - optimization (storing functionality needed, generating functionality where possible & where usage allows)
    - organization (indexing functionality in a way with specific side effects like limiting possibilities, and organization through queries & changes of functionality)

  - solution investing app
    - Is the cost (implementation/opportunity/mgmt/bug-fixing costs & lost previous work/equipment value) higher than the benefit?
      It's a technology if its problems solved/created ratio & relative feature value is high enough; if not, it's just a tax/debt
      We don't need to create problems to create jobs, we need guaranteed scientist jobs to handle existing science problems
      Companies/agencies should exist to manage/build solutions to existing science problems (pay this company $x to get y% of pollution removed from outdoor air)
      Taxes are a relatively inefficient & obscure way to allocate funds to these public good solutions, compared to product purchase payment plans
      People should be able to see what their taxes are funding & opt-out to invest in other products/companies
      - example: "avoid a local road that needs local govt budget to repair, to decide where to route funds to more important projects"
      There should be an app to opt-out of taxes if they agree not to use local resources those taxes pay for
      Companies can have efficiency & problem-solving scores (problem-solution, solution metrics, cost/benefit, hidden costs, time to solution, problem solved/created metrics) in a solution investing app to win investments from citizen investors to solve problems relevant to them
      - identify which companies/traders have the right market signals or info by retroactively analyzing historical data about which agents' investments turned out to be correct in the intended investing timeframe

  - apply intents & other interfaces to other decision (transaction) types (code transactions, financial transactions, legal transactions)
    - code transactions (user action like 'clicking a button' or 'running a script' indicates what intents, according to relevant system contexts, like applicable laws/protocols)
    - resource transactions (financial resource trades), to manage intents of a transaction - money is deposited on resource delivery, otherwise in pending state for x days agreed on by agents
    - legal transactions (allow laws to be passed having any of a limited list of approved intents)

  - finding necessary forms for an intent subject to indexed rules like laws, filling them out, and optionally filtering info by regulations cited in forms, including relevant regulations applied
    - involves automated calls/faxes to request/send forms, where processes/forms arent online, like how calls to find appointments are automated
      - involves functions to:
        - derive steps to complete the task in the right sequence/decision tree/flow chart structure (fill out form, fax form, consult legal consultant, review auto-filled input)
        - derive steps in the digitized process (log in, submit form, schedule appointment)
        - find & apply relevant regulations
        - find related forms
        - auto-fill forms
        - derive & execute steps to complete sub-tasks (like 'send a form' or 'schedule an appointment')
        - identify & highlight input that needs manual review
        - find people with expertise to guide manual review (legal consultant, govt employee)
        - digitize process (auto-import to workflow management tool or multi-step form component)

    - alternatively an automated process to digitize a process/form with necessary security, search functionality, and integration with other services/processes as digitization tool variabless
    - the tool should be able to submit user-permitted/submitted input to a preliminary process (like 'apply for a license' or 'submit voter registration') form (like a wsdl, other api spec, url with html form, or just a form pdf template with unfilled fields) and guess the values based on accessible inputs (user address info), then lookup any relevant regulations or related forms & fill out those forms or apply the regulations, and then return suggested output, with highlighting for missing fields or predicted fields with certainty below threshold that user or a legal consultant can manually review, and a list of remaining action items, which can be triggered if the user is ok with the output or updates the output, such as faxing/sending/printing/mailing the form on remote servers or using task-running apps to find a person willing to run the errand, or scheduling a call/appointment (like a dmv appointment).
    - this should also be applicable to software updates (submit a current request to a current wsdl, and find/apply relevant or recent govt regulation updates as well as web protocol updates to generate updated wsdl/request/response as well as request/response wrapper/handling functions, like updating new field names or request structures in codebase)

    - example of applying alternate interfaces with examples of advantages of each

      - the structure (position) of the component can be used to determine/differentiate its meaning
        - 'logy' and 'logi' as prefix/suffix
          - '-logy' as a study of the prefix
          - 'logi-' as a permutation of 'logic'

      - the usage context (sentences where they're used) can be used to determine intent
        - '-logy' used when 
          - discussing science & interactions between fields/topics or changes in a field/topic
        - 'logi-' used when 
          - discussing reasoning/rationality

      - intent can be used to determine meaning 
        - use '-logy' to describe a studying activity & topic
        - use 'logi-' to reference logic, its interactions & permutations

      - structural interface (differences in position) can be replaced with: 
        - intent (reason to use within a system usage context)
        - system interface (usage context to derive reason for usage), and fit to system (meaning)

      - applying different interface queries
        - apply system context to derive intent
        - apply structure (position) as an alternative to system context & intent

  - find meta-math structure: 
    - which would allow/incentivize/generate the changes in info functions/variables (change types: interaction, aggregation, structure-filling, gaps, convergence, similarities) of known math operations
    - is it a metric like efficient stability that allows info to develop into a measurable structure in the first place (possibly changeable interaction), or is it enforced by a system of a set of limits forcing info to interact those ways (definitively inevitable interaction)
    - 'the information amount/type/variance stored in this definition/structure can only take form in or interact with these other structures/to these degrees/in these spaces/on these interaction levels'
      - information = certainty = definition = structure
      - 'this certainty/structure can only interact with or be formatted in these certainties/structures'
      - can you calculate the set of math relationships more quickly by examining opposing structures of uncertainty/randomness, by applying operations to existing certainties, or by finding a common differentiating standard in between, like abstraction'

  - algorithm to generate variables in a system

    - development of a 'concept' in a system: an object begins aggregating changes (like functions/attributes) in such a way that it develops unique interactions that differ from those calculated by a simplistic summing of the interactions of its components
      - example: a system may develop a concept like a 'layer'
        - structural definition of a layer: a set of components that separates other components & their interactions, inside a containing boundary
          - this definition differentiates it from a boundary, limit, line, or container structure
        - the definition also has dimensions beyond a simple line
        - the layer may aggregate functionality, such as:
          - being stacked or combined to create larger layers or structures on top of a layer
          - forming a base for interactions to develop on, if its a vertically stacked layer
          - acting as a filter, if there are openings in the layer
        - so the layer is not only measurably different from similar structures, it may also have significantly different functionality, earning it a unique term (meaning it has developed into a 'concept' in the local system)

      - the variable of 'structure' can describe the layer & generate it, but it doesnt capture the full definition of the 'layer' concept
      - other variables are necessary to fully describe the layer, such as:
        - adjacent structures (line, container, limit, boundary)
        - core function (stack, combine, bridge, support)
        - adjacent functionality (filter, separating interaction layers)
        - default structure (vertical layer related to stacking function)
      - because it stabilizes into a useful unique component, the layer concept begins to act like a vertex variable and/or an interface, since it starts becoming causative of changes due to its stability (rather than just being the output of changes to similar structures or iterated core functions or aggregated variance)
      - concepts in a system can be local interfaces that are useful to use as standards for comparison
        - standardize to the 'layer' structural interface
        - standardize to the 'local system structural concept' interface

    - so you can generate the sequence of a set of variables for a system by which change type structures are stable enough to act like concepts/interfaces for a given stage subset in the sequence of system development

      - system metadata: invalidating/triggering/development conditions

    - you can also apply core structures to get change types (multiply a number by the structural concept of 'opposite' to get the 'sign/direction' variable)

    - variable definition: isolatable, measurable change type 

    - component generation: identify components of a system & generate possible change types that enable/optimize interactions between those components
      - core generation: identify core change types that can be combined to create other possible change types & generate other possible change types & filter
      - subset generation: identify subsets of a system's components that are sufficiently stable in functionality/attributes to interact with other subsets without invalidating the system
    - limit generation: identify limits of a system & generate possible change types that can develop within those limits & filter
      - reverse generation: generate required functionality in a system & derive possible variables that could produce it & filter
    - filter generation: identify & apply filters that determine variable development functions (like change combination, change metadata pattern, change coordination functions)
      - apply 'variable' definition filters: generate possible isolatable/measurable change types & filter
      - apply 'efficiency' definition filters: generate structures that would be efficient & check for components that could generate those structures
      - other example filters: 
        - are there resources to sustain this change type
        - does this change type contradict a system rule
        - is there a reason/intent/usage for this change type that is not fulfilled elsewhere (by metrics like adjacence to justify creating the functionality)
          - is there a system-invalidating force requiring a new change type
          - is there another position that could use similar functionality to existing functionality that is inaccessible in that position
        - is this change type adjacently buildable with system resources
        - is this change type probable
        - would this change type trigger changes that invalidate the system or reach stability
        - how would this change type interact with other change types
        - does the environment system change enough to justify developing another or extra change types

  - use isolatability/inevitability/uniqueness as a structural foundation for interface conversion/generation logic

    - identify 'inevitable' definition routes that are unique which can be used as a default generation intent for the core data included for app functionality

      - unique intents are also a useful foundation structure for the intent interface

    - apply structures to overlaps in definition routes
      - find the adjacent structure without contradictions, that doesnt resolve to either specific option, within the limits of both definition routes

        - optimized mathematized implementation for intent (simplicity, highest features given simplicity, maximized features)

            - variables: button count, button function, button structure (combination, set, sequence), function probability, simplicity

          - highest feature count, given filter of 'simplest implementation': highest number of functions possible to implement simply (low-dimensional memorization)
            - variables: function count, memorization, simplicity, abstraction (type), button usage structure (scale like repeated clicks of a button, sequence like buttons clicked in sequence)
            - variable interaction rules:
              - 'when function count increases absolutely (all other variables being equal), memorization decreases'
              - 'when count increases but is organized simply (like accessing functions organized by type or scale with successive button clicks), memorization is constant'
            - variable structure: 
              - intersection of independent variable changes (function count & memorization)
              - alignment of simplicity & memorization changes
              - alignment of abstraction (type) & simplicity changes

            - variables: config input (voice, button), variable variation, config adaptability, config source (custom user-defined function, open source/multi-vendor libraries)

        - how to generate optimized mathematized implementations for intents
          - apply structural definitions of components (rules, variables, intents, concepts)
          - find interface where these structural definitions of components can be depicted according to their variation (dimensionality), interactions (substitutability, causation), & metadata (accuracy)
            - interface where variable structures (constant, sequence, input) and function structures (interactions/alignments) can be found & connected as needed

        - identify interaction structures (like trade-offs) between optimization metrics
          - find maximization of metric-optimization in those interaction structures

    - vertex variable structures
      - quantum physics, prediction/derivation tools, build automation tools, testing tools, learning/adaptation tools, system rules, computation power are all vertex variables of information - they can generate/derive/find information
      - which structure (sequence, network, set, or cycle) of vertex variables is most efficient

    - add to markets:
      - examine net effect of competition on markets
        - does allowing companies to fail have a net negative effect thats biggest on the risk (insurance/debt) industries, organization/analysis (ratings, group investing), info markets, govt industry, or is the negative effect exported to other countries or used as an input (legal precedent, example to use for future legislation) or do negative effects continue to be transferred to end-nodes of debt chains (those oppressed by stacked inequalities)

    - add to internet optimizations: add local data backup centers to cache copies of critical data just like backup electricity generators to methods of recovering or rebuilding crashed systems with alternate data sources

    - add to govt:
      - in order to prevent "info genocide", where groups that dont adapt quickly (bc of lack of group self-awarenesss & resulting adaptation, or alternatively a lack of lighter/temporary/optional connections allowing competition in a free market of group membership, requiring adaptation in group market to survive) are eliminated by groups with better organization/cooperation/adaptation/self-awareness or freedom given to members, you can:
        - distribute power limits to prevent any group from acquiring more power than other groups (more resources in the form of info, tech, land, supply chain dominance, market share, innovation advantage, organization)
        - distribute power artificially to offset naturally occurring imbalances from randomness
        - delegate power to tech automation
        - prevent power from accruing (prevent info from being storable/transferrable)
        - help all groups achieve self-awareness & independence and distribute it to members

    - finish core component metadata
      - identify any missing attributes/functions that cant be reduced further
        - example: 
          - everything that exists (has structure, either implied or verified) has an opposite/different version, so 'opposite' is a core attribute
          - everything that has structure can be verified to some degree, so 'verifiability' is a core attribute

    - add to science: 
      - examine whether imaginary numbers are a structure of uncertainty (bc of structural unverifiability), producing reversals of info with application of self-similarity (like time reversals) when interacting with other systems like physics
      - example of aligning & standardizing to interfaces to identify optimal methods to solve a problem:
        - use of non-structural information (randomness, imaginary numbers, & other sources of uncertainty) as an input for intents like 'exploring rules of high-variation structures like energy, info, or space-time'
        - example accidental application of this: https://phys.org/news/2021-03-imaginary-quantum-resource-theory.html
      - examine peak/valley of space-time wave as flow between energy (info) storage/usage types, possibly acting as opposite ends of a spectrum representing a trade-off (on liquidity, direction & other attributes)
      - examine magnetic/gravitational/electrical/other forces determining relationships of space-times
        - forces allowing:
          - non-adjacent & multi-directional space-times to be connected
          - space-times that arent efficient enough to be used as input to be left behind/dissolved rather than crystallized/connected
        - finding structures of lack where forces arent triggered bc there arent particles or other structures of energy there, to allow for uncertainties to develop & be used as input

    - add to bio system analysis: examine what types/positions of intentionally triggerable DNA damage can be used as a way to produce pathogen DNA sections at scale to generate immunity-producing immune response (mutation stack/factory)
      - structural (DNA/cell) damage/change triggers: mutations from toxins, exercise, animal pathogens, enzymes, competition for energy, & other types of DNA mutations
      - structural (DNA/cell) division/growth triggers: hormones, extra energy (energy imbalance based on need)
      - structural (DNA/cell) repair/recovery/regulation triggers: like bypassing digestion with amino acids to help recovery, timing cycles & alignment
      - other sources of structural change/standardization: 
        - gaps in cell types/attributes
        - sets of attributes
        - clusters of attribute changes/values
        - structural interaction levels
      - once you identify a section of existing DNA/RNA that, when isolated & edited, would produce a useful section of pathogen DNA to trigger immunity with minimal & possible editing (adjacent change) given exposure to a chemical or other stressor:
        - identify position in bio system where this change could be triggered by exposure in such a way that production of the DNA section is scalable (like in a cell that is about to be copied or a root/memory/template/stem cell) & where immune response would be quick
        - identify filter/containing structures necessary to give exposure/immune responses the time they need
        - identify type of exposure possible (injection, nanoparticle) and assemble components
      - identify evolution triggers (like cycles & variation of stressors) & use as a supply of change requests to trigger adaptive mutations for pathogens or pathogen types


# content/config

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths (info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight', system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub')
    - define default & core objects necessary for system to function (out of the box, rather than minimal config necessary to derive other system components & assemble)
      - add default functions to solve common problem types
      - alternate utility function implementations have variation potential in the exact operations used to achieve the function intents, but there are requirements in which definitions these functions use because they are inherent to the system. For example, the embodiment may use a specific definition of an attribute (standardized to a set of filters) in order to build the attribute-identification function using a set of filters - but the general attribute definition is still partially determined in its initial version by requirements specified in the documentation, such as a set of core attribute types (input, output, function parameter, abstract, descriptive, identifying, differentiating, variable, constant), the definition of a function, and the definition of conversion functions between standard formats.
    - document time structures (concave time explaining compounding similarities up to a point of maximum concavity, a structure that can separate from the other space-times)
    - systematize your definitions of info objects, to include analysis that produces relationships of core objects like opposites to their relevant forms (anti-symmetry) in addition to permuted object states (asymmetry), such as an anti-strategy, anti-information, anti-pattern
      - organize certainty (info) vs. uncertainty objects (potential, risk, probability)
      - make doc to store insight paths, counterintuitive functions, hidden costs, counterexamples, phase shift triggers
      - add technicality, synchronization, bias, counterintuition, & certainty objects leading to inevitable collisions
        - the collision of compounding forces producing a phase shift
        - lack of attention in one driver and false panic in a second driver leading to a car crash given the bases where their processes originate
      - define alignment on interfaces (compounding, coordinating, parallel, similar, etc)
      - start with these info object transforms that filter the most info: opposite, invalidating, symmetric, core, aligning, boundary-breaking, phase shift activating, structure stabilizing, constant changing, converging
      - add core info objects (core strategies, core assumptions) so you can make a network of graphs for a system
    - concept analysis:
      - how new concepts (gaps in network rules) evolve once structure is applied to prior concepts 
    - interface analysis:
      - limitations of interfaces & how to derive them
      - how rules develop on stability & how foundations are connected & destroyed
      - explainability as a space limited by derivable attributes from data set & cross-system similarity
      - vertex definition & give examples (as an intersection/combination of interface variables, such as determining/description(compressing)/generative/causative/derivation variables), around which change develops
    - change analysis:
      - generated object change types
        - constant to variable
        - variable to removal of assumption in variable type/data type

    - examine implementing your solution type (constructing structures (made of boundary/filter/resource sets) to produce substances like antibodies, using bio system stressors)
    
    - merge definitions into docs/tasks/implementation/constants/definitions.json
      - add to definitions.json

                - utility value
                - uniqueness
              - similarity
            - system fit
              - understanding

    - clarify/resolve terms that can be conflated: 
      - shape/structure
      - rule/test/metric/limit/threshold/boundary/state change/phase shift
      - intent/priority/motivation/incentive
      - method/function/rule/pattern (pattern is a sequence of specific objects)
      - path/route/trajectory/traversal/order/list/sequence
      - object/entity/item/component
      - type/class/category/group/subset
      - closed/isolated/independence/unique/orthogonal
      - model/perspective/filter
      - standard/interface/index/symmetry
      - dimension/variable/axis
      - space/system/context
      - perspective/filter/standard/index & relationship to variables/operations on the interface
      - filter vs. rule is a similar question to attribute vs. rule - sometimes one format is better based on the info you have, sometimes its worth it to transform the format
        - interface network: a set of standardizing filters applicable to format information in way that it can be analyzed with interface-specific logic, 
        - a query of the interface network may also be a problem-solving automation workflow, if problems can be solved with the format sequence indicated by the interface traversal

        -  For a prediction function problem, the solution space is the range of likely prediction functions. 
        - The problem space is the route between independent variables and the dependent variable on a network - it can also be framed as the route between common prediction function terms for a data set like the input data set, and the prediction function. The original problem structure is also depicted as a subset of this problem space visualization.
        - The solution function can be a route on the problem space if the problem space is formatted as a network, for example.
        
        - interface: a useful standard for comparison consisting of the filtering object's definition routes, conversion function, core functions, objects, & attributes, and related objects like patterns & metadata specific to the interface. Abstract interfaces include cause, concept, structure, etc, whereas specific interfaces are other foundations where change develops in a clearly defined range that can be found in specific systems. The traversal of an interface implies finding a map between objects, functions, & attributes inherent to that interface to the problem objects, functions, & attributes. The application of an interface is an operation in an interface combination, mapping, injection, or other operation. 
        - function: a set of inputs, a sequential list of rules or rule lists (logic tree) applied to the input set, an output set created by changes to the input set executed by the sequential rule list, optionally including side effects from execution. A function may be formatted in a different way, such as a list of attributes, filters, or a network. The function definition includes: 
            - attributes: 
                - alignment: enforced/optional, core, required, emergent/output (built from core functions, with or without associated intent) 
                - interaction: cooperative/conflicting 
                - intent: generative, filtering, grouping, organization/delegation/ distribution/matching/grouping/filtering, classification, differentiation/ transformation 
                - scope: use case, context, range, host system 
                - related objects (like host spaces/systems & object positions in those) 
                - types: 
                    - core functions 
                    - meta (rule-modification/generation rules) 
                    - attribute rules (state, scope) 
                    - interaction rules (competition, binding, combination, sharing, collaboration, intersection, conflict resolution, trade rules) 
                    - assessment rules (metric, difference, definition, validation) 
                    - processing rules 
                    - change rules (update, distortion, maintenance, adjacency, conversion) 
                    - filtering rules (find, identify, define, alternate, organize, learn) - matching rules (fitting a structure, filling a structures) 
                    - application rules (inject, embed, apply) 
                    - derivation rules (structure, navigate, abstract) 
                    - decision rules (prioritize, select, compare) 
                    - formatting rules (standardize, isolate, cluster) 
                    - destruction rules (replace, invalidate, neutralize, remove, merge, de- duplicate) 
                    - government rules (monitor, correct, enforce, maintain, stabilize) 
                    - system rules (incentives, variance handling, optimization) 
                    - interface rules (change, intent, type, pattern, concept) 
                    - info rules (problem, strategy, insight, game, perspective) 
                    - variance (injection, leaks, combination, replacement, causal direction, uncertainty, risk, potential, probability, prediction) rules 
                    - information handling (storage, versioning, replacement, merging, monitoring, indexing, communication, interpretation, processing) 
                    - solution rules (variance/stressor/error detection, tracing, identification & handler) 
                    - structure rules (gap, boundary, system, limit, hub, object, link, network, filter)     
        - intent: any of an abstract goal with direction, a reason to use something, or an output such as the intended result or an unintended side effect, which can be an abstract priority like fairness, a concrete goal, and can have a starting & ending position. 
        - game: a set of intents/alternatives/limits/incentives/exploits/rules/risk & a definition of distance from intent fulfillment (position), usually resulting in the resolution of a clearly optimal route. The game definition includes: 
            - a game is a type of system & a mixed set, which can exist as a component of a system 
            - games can have many different structures like: 
                - a directed graph with a vector set representing possible agent intents/ functions/resources 
                - a system of nodes & links where agents need function input resources to traverse 
                - a decision tree where certain tree info becomes accessible only at certain nodes (adding uncertainty/risk) 
                - a set of trade options between nodes with different info change/update rules in a system to optimize a resource/trade/market metric 
        - concept: set of unique objects remaining once objects from other spaces have their context & contradictory attributes removed. For example: power is the object left when objects implementing it: resources => energy => input => potential) have their context removed, navigating up the abstraction stack from: 
            - the info layer (resources & energy), removing their contextual attributes/rules - to the abstract structural layer (input) 
            - to the abstract layer (potential, which is a related concept of power) 
            - so that the final object is defined in terms of other abstract objects on the top layer 
        - problem: may include any context or condition that causes a negative position or state determined by a metric for an agent in a system. The problem definition includes problem types like dependencies, leaks (variance, resource/info),  injection (assumptions/variance/control/randomness), mismatches, conflicts, imbalances, inefficiencies, incorrect metric, misidentification, gaps, limits, side effects: whether it's a closed system or leaks variance (function side effect example: before execution: pre-computing, during: memory access/overflow, after: process re-starting), specific problems like an enforcement gap (should have enforced rule but did not), an unintended use (involves integrated third party tech not under review), a malicious alternative route to get same output, a legitimate/alternative route to get malicious output. 
        - problem space: context relevant to a problem; the containing system(s) of a problem that may include related problems 
        - solution: may include any combination of events, methods, or steps that reduces the negative position or state for the specified agent. The solution definition includes solution types: 
            - solution-metadata solution: evaluating & comparing solution metadata for solution selection 
            - problem-metadata solution: evaluating problem metadata to evaluate metrics like problem-solving postponement 
            - generative solution: solution that generates solutions 
            - solution framework: provides starting point & structures for solutions to be built in/with 
            - problem decomposer: solution that reduces a problem's root causative (as opposed to just varying) parameters 
            - solution automator: solution that automates solutions of a type 
            - interim solution: clearly suboptimal solution while optimal alternative is built

            - structure-finding solution: solution that assigns a structure to information 
            - structure-fitting solution: solution that matches the gaps/limits in a problem structure to neutralize them

        - component: functions/attributes/types/objects/systems 
        - input information: can refer to original information input to the initial interface traversal, or traversal output information that has been converted, enhanced, formatted, or otherwise altered in a prior interface traversal, stored as a possible version of the original input information, and sent as input to another interface traversal 
        - interface: 
        - function: a set of inputs, a sequential list of rules or rule lists (logic tree) applied to the input set, an output set created by changes to the input set executed by the sequential rule list, optionally including side effects from execution. A function may be formatted in a different way, such as a list of attributes, filters, or a network. 
        - intent: any of an abstract goal with direction, a reason to use something, or an output such as the intended result or an unintended side effect, which can be an abstract priority like fairness, a concrete goal, and can have a starting & ending position. 
        - concept: set of unique objects remaining once objects from other spaces have their context & contradictory attributes removed.  
        - network: standard network graph containing nodes (sometimes called vertices) & linking functions (sometimes called edges), with or without node attributes, function relationship determining function shape, and direction as an indicator of intent or another metric.  

       - info conceptual relationships:
          priority = direction
          observation = insight = function = result = relationship
          conclusion = ordered_list(observations) + guess = coefficients + bias
          strategy = ordered_list(insights)
          strategy = insight + context
          problem = (combination of intents having different priorities) or (an resource distribution imbalance)
          intent = strategy + priority
          solution = (combination of strategies operating on variables with insight functions that reduce dimensions of problem (function-combination) or (resource-imbalance))
          type = combination(attributes)
          intents = function outputs, including unintended/emergent/unforeseen side effects (target/avoid)
          roles = functions
          relationships = treatments, intents, functions, insights, strategies, mechanisms, patterns, systems
          components = compounds, symptoms, treatments, metrics, conditions, stressors, types, variables
