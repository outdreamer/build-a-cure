# to do

    - this isnt a war against a country or religion or ethnicity, or a specific group of criminals, or other powerful entities or people - its a war against the suffering of others who are oppressed, vulnerable & deserving - against inequality, against easy, against cruelty, greed & all other vices that cause their suffering, and against the self-oppression of anyone who stands in the way of us saving the others - a war that we fight with tools of love, in giving solutions away to those in need, finding new solutions as needed, trying new strategies where the old ways don't work, distributing power wherever it's hoarded & otherwise abused
      - I will cry for the lost when I have time to spare
      - if you think you need to attack me, first attack the errors of your mind, and see how happy it makes you compared to everything you thought you needed
      - confused as to how the greatest minority of all time (an extremely high-functioning biracial hero genius rape, genocide, theft, racism/sexism, & hate crime survivor, who is the very first & last of her kind) is surviving your claimed false disapproval with ease, since there's no legitimate way to criticize me so you have to criticize lies about me & try to force me to pretend theyre true by scaring me to death & other methods of coercion so you can get cheap good feelings? (lol!) upset that no one protected you from your crimes? a little sad that you dont get to crap on oppressed people for cheap good feelings anymore? starting to realize you might not actually deserve all those fake cheap good feelings if you cant get over an insult to save the world? feeling a dawning sense of dread that you might not be as wonderful or important to me as you self-report? in awe of my mind's spectacular stress-handling problem-solving skills? concerned that you cant control me like I gave you false hope of easily doing to see if you would take easy opportunities for cruelty? (lol of course you would, you dont have humanity!) worried you might be one of my many terrible jokes? puzzling over what else people can get you to do just with insults/compliments & peer pressure bc youre totally & utterly insecure? (it's anything, anyone can get you to do anything) want some of my fancy human qualities like potential, a sense of humor, chill, confidence that I can handle anything, free will, and a conscience - without faking them by merely claiming to have them or repeating words i say like you always do? looking for something else to rape or steal from me, in case you missed anything? thinking about targeting an easier victim than me, since this didnt work out so well & produce the good feelings you were seeking to forget what you are? welcome to la realidad! here are my methods of survival & adaptation! feel free to try to home-grow a brain instead of molesting me or anyone else!

    - we still have to vaccinate the world's poorest bc we kept them poor so they couldn't vaccinate themselves bc when people are poor, there are thousands of things that could kill them, so we have to save them from all of the thousands of things each time which is very expensive, bc we havent helped them build sustainable stabilized markets to trade in, which is cheaper

    - if trolling you was all it took to inspire you to do better (and if youre actually better), you were already a few steps away, though thats not quite the same as being unwaveringly committed to my goal of saving the potential in the world despite all the barriers you put in my way, is it?

  - translate interface queries & solution automation workflows to other interfaces
    - apply other interfaces like 'structure' interface to specify a query/workflow and interfaces like 'concept' to abstract a query/workflow

  - finish list of useful interface components, including structures of useful interface components like specific useful concepts
    - example: 'apply concepts to system to identify conceptual structures in system'
      - system
        - system structures of uniqueness: exclusivities
        - system structures of power: trigger, input

  - finish interface query design rules
    - 'if solution requirements arent given, derive/predict them or apply default requirements from related/similar problems'

  - example of different structures of an interface component on different interfaces
      - alternative
        - 'structural alternative': where one or more structures are options where one or the other or both if not mutually exclusive can be chosen (applied at a given time), with varying relevance/optimization, for a particular intent (like 'navigate in a direction', having structural alternatives in the form of a set of paths)
        - 'conceptual alternative': where one or more concepts can be applied at a given time with varying relevance/optimization for a particular intent (concepts with an intent in common)
        - 'structural conceptual alternative': alternative conceptual structures, like varying structures of power or balance
      - alignment
        - 'structural alignment': based in the structural interface, where a 'structural alignment' takes the form of an equivalence/similarity in components (attributes/functions/objects/structures), such as:
          - interchangeable attributes/functions/objects
          - a fitting/matching structure
          - a parallel structure
          - a structure having similar shape or other attribute like size
        - 'conceptual alignment': translated to the conceptual interface, an 'alignment' takes the form of concept such as 'equal' and/or related concepts like 'similar'
        - example of injecting the structural interface to components on other interfaces:
          - a 'structural conceptual alignment' is the 'alignment' in structures of concepts, like 'similar conceptual connections' or 'equivalent concepts'

  - document useful component/sub-structures of interface queries (interface components, interaction rules, cross-interface interactions, generative functions)

  - interaction rules of useful cross-interface or useful interface components (efficiencies/alignments)
    - to answer questions like:
      - with what 'frequency' can a 'random combination' of 'alignments' create an 'efficiency' in a given 'system'?
    - having variables:
      - solution formats
        - certainty (probability, frequency, average) 
          - format solution as 'certainty of a particular structure given inputs' rather than other formats like 'method to generate a particular structure given inputs'
      - solution filters
        - requirements
        - intents
      - problem space
        - system context
      - interactions
        - applicable connecting logic rules
        - attributes (random, adjacent, difference-maximizing, similar, opposite)
        - structures (combination, subset)
      - interacting components
        - useful components (alignments, efficiency)

  - identifying useful cross-interface interactions

    - examples:
      - 'merge difference types' function
      - 'common relevant efficiencies' structures
      - 'find simplifying/generative/change-generating function' function

    - how to identify useful cross-interface interactions:

      - structures of useful components from one interface applied to another interface
        - example: useful structure interface components (combinations) of useful system components (incentives, ambiguities) applied to other interfaces

      - useful interaction structures of relevant problem-solving structures (like core interface structures or problem interface structures like errors)
        - 'merge' is a useful interaction structure of error structures like 'difference types'
        - 'common relevant efficiencies' combines multiple useful interface structures/attributes to create a useful structure for 'fulfilling an intent', which is relevant to 'problem-solving'

  - document useful structures & generative functions of cross-interface interactions (like structure-concept interactions)
    
    - example:
      
      - structures that generate function to 'merge difference types'
      
      - structures with conceptual attribute 'relevance':

        - a 'database index' structure gathers & searches just the information useful for 'find' intents based on structures of standards like 'what is commonly searched for' and 'what varies across data' and 'what combination of fields uniquely identifies/differentiates data', so it can be used to fulfill intents like:
          - intent: 'identify unique records'
            - fulfills 'unique combination' standard
          - intent: 'find records quickly by only searching relevant data'
            - fulfills 'what is commonly searched for' standard
          - intent: 'differentiate records'
            - fulfills 'what varies across data' standard
        
        - applying the above structures of standards as solution filters can find the 'database index' structure in the 'search database' problem space

        - the solution creates an efficiency for the 3 'search database' intents, while creating inefficiencies for the 'minimize storage' & 'generalize solution' intent
          - these intents could be fulfilled with modifications to the 'database index' solution:
            - 'minimize storage': store static values in a nested index
            - 'generalize solution': apply 'database index' solution dynamically or for other queries or query types

        - interface query to generate implementation of this cross-interface interaction
          
          - identify variables
            - core variables
              - data set format
              - data set stores
              - data set store format
              - data set store fields
              - data set store records
              - search method
              - sort method
              - storage method
              - query
            - variable combinations
              - data set/store-query relation
              - search-sort relation

          - apply requirement filters to solution space:
            - iterating data of some format is required
          
          - apply variable expansions to solution space:
            - apply probability interface to 'input/output formats' structure: 
              - data doesnt have to be in original input format or output format of 'common' queries
            - apply change interface to 'input/output formats' structure: 
              - data doesnt have to be in a static format
            - apply structural interface: 
              - data can be in 'multiple' formats
              - data 'subsets' can be stored in addition to the 'complete' data set

          - apply structure filters: 
            - what structure in the 'search database' problem space can identify unique field combinations, enable quick searching for common searches, and differentiate data (even if it differentiates them incompletely, or to a contextual definition of 'differentiate')

            - apply differences to variable values to generate core adjacent combinations of variable values
              - store subset of rows for a query type (search only these rows for queries involving these fields/operations/conditions/values)
              - store subset of fields (search only these fields)
              - store subset of example rows with allowed variation (search for these examples for these queries & anything adjacent to the example)
              - store data patterns to search for a query (search for these patterns for these queries)
            
            - filter combinations by usefulness for 'search database' problem intents
              - apply filter with 'system optimization' ('only add required functionality')
                - which of the combinations fulfills the above 3 intents without fulfilling extra unnecessary intents (aligned demand/supply of intents)

  - ml explanation of finding coefficients of prediction function by applying distortions to coefficients & ruling out distortions that dont contribute to prediction accuracy
    - can be optimized with reductions like:
      - 'calculating the most different distortions that will reduce possible values the quickest & applying those distortions'
  
  - proof/determination structures
      - what makes something possible to determine/calculate
        - a solution structure where the solution metric is clearly defined (structural or having other structures of certainty like consistency or inevitability or requirement)
          - checking a path to see if it includes a node twice is clearly defined (it uses the structure of 'node visit counts' in the 'path' solution structure)
      - what makes something difficult to prove
        - where there are ambiguities (lack of certainty/structure/definition) between the input parameters & the output function value
          - ambiguities such as where multiple inputs produce the same output, like how different x-values can produce the same y value on a wave function
      - useful proof structures
        - apply possible components to create an absolute or scalable definition include components framed in terms of interactions with other components that can be used with a consistent measurement (like a stable structure across interfaces or dimension sets) & can also scale (boundaries), rather than framing them in terms that can have different meanings at different parameters (closed, hollow)

    - add to causation variables
      - ability to change (if a variable cant be changed, it is less causative for problem-solving intents)

    - give examples of identifying vertex variables
      - general vertex variables: topic, origin/destination, reason/cause/point/intent, errors, variables, types
      - comedy vertex variables: sincerity, stupidity, stakes, tension-resolution/expectation-subverting pattern variation
      - music vertex variables: tone, tension-resolution/expectation-subverting pattern variation, lyrics
      - optimization metric vertex variables: solution metric patterns (what other solutions optimize for, to determine optimization metrics to apply)

    - when is it optimal to store a mixed structure of varying specificity (like a type, intent, cause & a specific example)
      - when there are potential uncertainties to resolve, like whether the example represents a new error, type, or variable, bc the example doesnt fit known structures

    - all primary interfaces can act like the problem-solving interface (start solving problem from the concept or structure interface and integrate all info back into that interface & frame the solution in terms of that interface) but the meaning interface (the interface interface) is the most powerful

  - visualizing higher dimensions with changes in a network of visualizable variable subsets like:

    - dimension subsets: displaying dimension subsets in groups of sizes that are already visualizable (from 1 - 4 dimensions), where orthogonality is preserved across the network of subsets
    - dimension groups: grouping similar dimensional changes into a change type across a dimension subset, to visualize the change types
    
    - relevant (robust) dimensions
      - dimension invalidations: grouping invalidating/neutralizing change types
      - causative dimensions: just visualizing higher-impact/causal dimensions
      - vertex dimensions: graphing variables as differences from vertex variables
    
    - mapping dimensions: group value sets as other structures like points or networks in a space where change types like 'continuous change' are supported
      - embedded dimensions: dimensions graphed visually using extra dimensions as parameters
      - base dimensions: dimensions standardized to a base and graphed in alignment, like multiple functions on a graph with a common base
      - mapping other dimension metadata: interactions between dimensions units/change types/limits/definitions are graphed
      - abstract dimensions: abstract value structures are graphed ('a point on a line') instead of specific values in a dimension
      - constant dimensions: adjacent limiting constant dimensions are graphed instead of dimensions of change

    - dimension interactions: 
      - interactive dimensions: dimensions that interact are condensed into an input/output of the interaction structure, and input/output dimensions are graphed instead
      - dimension interaction structures: structures of interactions between variables (like direction/circuits/networks) are preserved, where values may be lost
        - dimensional difference: difference between dimensions is graphed instead of different dimensions & values, where dimension values are structures associated with graphed dimension interactions
        - conversion requirements: conversion requirements to a visualizable shape are graphed instead of actual dimensions/values
        - interaction structures between value structures like positions on dimensions when graphed as a standardized shape
          - example: with dimensions formatted as a standardized form like 'lines of equal length, & values as points on these lines', the interaction structure would be the lines connecting the points on the dimension lines, when arranged in any order

    - example of resolving a conflict between structure/limits using a structural similarity between a structure (gradient of function) & its container/limits (gradient of constraints)
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier
      - also an example of a solution space (the whole function is the solution space of possible minima/maxima) and a filter applied to it (constraint)

    - make a function network of math domains (inputs/outputs of geometry, algebra, calculus that align)

    - resolve definitions of components so you can finish organizing useful structures like combinations of concepts such as "format sequence", "solution automation workflow", "insight path", "reverse-engineer solution from problem requirements or opposite structures", "connect problem & solution"

    - example of how to generate monopoly case arguments
      - change variable 'location of power':
        - spotify is welcome to build their own app store with their own phones or team up with their coalition to do so
        - add variable 'time sequence' to 'location of power' change:
          - if spotify operates an app store someday, they will set rules to benefit themselves too, just like theyve done in the past
        - offer an alternative to charging app store rate
          - is there a one-click button to migrate from spotify to apple that could replace any difference in taxes on spotify
      - apply conceptual definition filter 'does concept of persecution (and related components of the definition like focus) apply to the behavior (does behavior have a specific target that is the focus of persecution)'
        - are apple's rules applied exclusively to spotify? if not, it's not anti-competitive behavior
      - apply intent filter
        - is spotify's mission nobler than apple's
      - apply system cost-benefit analysis
        - what features were improved bc spotify exists? are those features worth anything or required needs? did they develop those features better than competitors?
        - if spotify is just charging rent on a catalog, are they adding value to the market, so they should be allowed to dictate the market at all?
        - what products/features would apple develop if they didnt have to pay a fine, and what are those features worth, and are those features required?
      - apply logical fallacy filters
        - apply 'hypocrisy' filter
          - apply 'anti-competitive' conceptual definition structures & test if these structures fit the opponent
            - does spotify plan on raising prices at some point or will they keep prices low even if the app store rate holds? are they only keeping prices low to dominate the market & plan on raising prices later? isnt that anti-competitive behavior?
            - if they are so concerned about anti-competitive behavior, why arent they trying to compete by building their own app store? isnt there a risk that the apple app store is sub-optimal and needs to be improved with competition from spotify

    - value isnt created/lost by companies in the timespan of hype/short cycles, so stock market price swings aren't reflective of reality from a macro perspective
      - it takes years to build value, it doesn't happen overnight, excluding almost magical insights that create cascading efficiencies like my system
      - losing value also happens slowly, excluding extreme natural disasters, like the value of a community still being relatively high despite shared losses, bc of social network effects & organization/coordination effects
      - value can be calculated differently, using metadata like the lifetime & total possible value of a product
        - what is the total supply of the product inputs (fossil fuels)
        - what is the usability lifetime
        - what are the costs
        - what are the product intent alternatives (can intents fulfilled by the product be fulfilled by other products)
        - what is purchased with revenue from a product (research, insights, other more valuable resellable products, etc)
        - if this pricing method is applied to fossil fuels, oil companies would be paying people to use them

    - identify filters for definition routes

    - database polling/prompting user for update & predicting updates or searching for & receiving user-approved updates from other services, rather than being a passive receiver of input from user
      - based on local usage/change patterns or integrated usage patterns to identify expected transactions with other services
        - once a credit card is marked as lost in a banking service, a change of credit card numbers is expected by other services which can poll for updates to this flag
          - user option like 'yes, allow other approved databases containing my address poll to collect this update'
        - once a renters insurance policy is changed in an insurance service, a change of address might be expected by other services

    - make list of variable structure variables measured by algorithms & why they are measured by a network algorithm

  - make diagram of absolute reference connections with metadata structures like networks/paths
  - determine core graph variables (definition of adjacence/difference, connectivity, dimensions, info storage methods, interactivity of structures like sequences)
  - crypto as community consensus, where a decision can have value if backed by a community

    - examine connection between fractals, sequences, averages, origins, multipliers (self, as in power), & circles
      - fractals as a relevant structure for adding sequences of fractions (adding numbers similar to itself on a smaller scale, infinitely) as a way of producing inputs to circles created by transforming a fractal spiral, where the origin is the original number as a base for applying increasingly smaller scales
      - the set of points forming roots of an infinite negative number sequence (roots of unity, rather than roots of any negative integer number) as a way of producing a circle because of their common distance to their average (center) forming the radius
      - lines of equal length having a common average point (center/origin)
      - fractals & infinite sequences as a way of calculating area under a continuous line (increasing small subsets of structures with area calculatable with multiplication of x & y)
      - what continuous line segments would have an area equal to a circle of relevant proportions?

    - how to identify the killer counterpoint
      - point: 'election fraud claims'
        - counterpoint: you dont think the other party has members?
          - followup points:
            - how are they organizing? why do you even hear about them?
            - who's benefitting from investing massive funding in creating a false illusion, if its all fake?
            - why wouldnt they choose cheaper methods of doing so than an elaborate illusion?
      - identify most extreme false assumption of point by identify causes of the output metric (vote count)
        - the primary/basic false assumption of the point is that the other side doesnt have votes that are comparable in quantity
          - possible causes (inputs) of 'not having similar vote count' include:
            - not going to vote
            - not being able to vote
            - not having members to vote
          - the most extreme false assumption is the most extreme cause of 'not having similar vote count' (that the other side doesnt even have members (input of votes) that are comparable in quantity, let alone votes (output))
      - identify 'incentives', 'side effects of party/member/vote existence & size' as other relevant concepts to generate followup questions

    - the work of 'stealing my work' and 'pretending not to' doesnt produce efficient brains with a good grasp of concepts like 'meaning', so it emerges as an inefficiency bc the type of brains developed wont be good at finding solutions to output problems generated by granularly copying/pasting to a specific problem/solution & hoping it works better
            - 'understanding my work' is a better goal if you cant look away bc youre not done experiencing awe
              - once you understand it, you wont need to watch me work, youll be able to generate my work
  
  - apply nn to derive error types & bias incorporated into other nn data/parameters/algorithms/structures/models    


## general

    - examine error type of conflating intent & requirement
    
    - consciousness as choice to move between neural nodes (rather than being directed) required:
      - the development of alternative node paths performing equal/similar functions, requiring:
        - the development of excess resources, delaying required decision time (making immediate decision unnecessary, avoiding a forced decision), requiring:
          - the existence & application of previous efficiencies & functions for alternative evaluation, energy storage, storage-checking, & energy requirement-identifying
      - the cause could be framed as structures such as an 'efficiency stack' or 'energy maintenance functions' or 'alternative options' or 'navigation/motion control' or 'lack of requirement/need'
    
    - examine similarity (alignment/overlap) structures between: 
      - extremely different components (when an error type is an incentive or a function used for other intents) 
        - when the solution format of some problem has similarities to the error type, like when you need randomness so errors generating randomness are a possible function to use for that intent
        - contradictory/opposite components (have some metric in common, with opposite values)

  - finish organizing lists of examples, functions, info objects (insight paths, definitions, questions), components for configuration

    - organize examples

## examples


  - examine the distortion vector paths that adjacently decompose a data set into a prediction function from a base point/function set

  - give example of mapping to structures & identifying contradictions its safe to ignore for applying a structure

  - example of permuting assumption: "reports of power consumption have to be exact measurements" 
    - a temperature monitor sensitive to a hundredth of a degree might provide similar but non-specific power reporting for important/extreme usage patterns without revealing such specific information as that which could infer exact operations being done, bc the interval of temperature measurements allows for greater variation in calculations that could explain it
  
  - query examples for use cases like:
    - lack of information stored (match problem of type 'information lack' with interface query 'check pattern interface for similar patterns')
    - query problem breakdown & integration diagram
    - calculating various different problem breakdown strategies first before executing normal query-building logic for each
  
  - add examples of system/object/rule/type change patterns
  
  - include example workflows with example problems
    - include example of how to generate other workflows (different starting/ending points & trajectories)

  - example of using set theory in query operations:
    - edges as core organizing/formatting operations (find/apply) & interfaces (connecting/explanatory concepts/functions)

                  - interpreted as right in the 'conversation with dictator' system context
                    - expected interaction in this context
                      - 'should bring up human rights to a criminal'

  - diagram for structures of emergence
    - example: 1-1 input/output relationship up an interaction layer, where extra resources that dont dissolve immediately on the higher interaction layer aggregate & form core structures like combinations, where interactions between combinations & sequences have different dynamics than the individual output interacting with other individual outputs
    - emergent functionality/attributes come from interaction structures (sequences & layers)

    - add diagram for intent-matching
    - add structures to diagram: interface overflow (to sub-interfaces), interface foundation
    - diagram for workflow 1: 
      - function to determine relevance filter ('functions', 'required') from a problem_step ('find incentives') for a problem definition, to modify problem_steps with extra functions/attributes ('change_position') to be more specific to the problem definition ('find_incentives_to_change_position') for problem_steps involving 'incentives', so you know to use the function_name to modify the problem step if it's between the type 'functions' and the object searched for 'incentives'
    - add conceptual math interface query diagram
      - use lattice multiplication as standard example, other than core operations (add/multiply mapped to language, concepts like irreversibility/asymmetry mapped to math)
    - interface conversion, matching, starting point selection (applying structure, checking if relevant information is found)
    - diagram to document sub-functions of core functions with distortions
    - make diagram for dimension links higher than 3d that are depictable in the same network space
      - should show variables that impact other variables, the change rates of these relationships
      - overall impact should be calculatable from these relationships
      - should show similar movements for correlated variables
      - should show skippable/derivable variables (variables that can be resolved later than they normally are)
      - should show meta forces for overall trends in change rules (direction of combined variable forces)
      - should show limits of measurability & threshold metrics

    - diagrams for specific concepts, core functions, concept operations (combine, collide, connect, merge, apply), ethical shapes
        - variable accretion patterns (how an object becomes influenced by a new variable, complex system interaction patterns, etc)
        - make diagram of potential matrix to display the concept
          - map parameter sets to potential matrix shapes 
        - finish diagrams for cause (shapes & ambiguity), concept (evolution of concepts, networks, distortion functions)
        - diagram for argument
      - make a system layer diagram for each interface to allow specification of core interfaces & other interface layers (interface interface)
        - make a system layer diagram for structures to include layers of structures 
          (beyond core structures like curves, to include n-degree structures like a wave, as well as semantic output structures like a key, crossing the layer that generates info structures like an insight, a probability, etc)

    - map variable structures to prediction potential for problem types, given ratio of equivalent alternate signals

    - vertex variable structures
      - quantum physics, prediction/derivation tools, build automation tools, testing tools, learning/adaptation tools, system rules, computation power are all vertex variables of information, since they can generate/derive/find information
        - which structure (sequence, network, set, or cycle) of vertex variables is most efficient

    - core component attributes: identify any missing attributes/functions that cant be reduced further

# content/config

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths (info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight', system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub')
    - define default & core objects necessary for system to function (out of the box, rather than minimal config necessary to derive other system components & assemble)
      - add default functions to solve common problem types
      - alternate utility function implementations have variation potential in the exact operations used to achieve the function intents, but there are requirements in which definitions these functions use because they are inherent to the system. For example, the embodiment may use a specific definition of an attribute (standardized to a set of filters) in order to build the attribute-identification function using a set of filters - but the general attribute definition is still partially determined in its initial version by requirements specified in the documentation, such as a set of core attribute types (input, output, function parameter, abstract, descriptive, identifying, differentiating, variable, constant), the definition of a function, and the definition of conversion functions between standard formats.
    - document time structures (concave time explaining compounding similarities up to a point of maximum concavity, a structure that can separate from the other space-times)
    
    - systematize definitions of info objects, to include analysis that produces relationships of core objects like opposites to their relevant forms (anti-symmetry) in addition to permuted object states (asymmetry), such as an anti-strategy, anti-information, anti-pattern
      - organize certainty (info) vs. uncertainty objects (potential, risk, probability)
      - make doc to store insight paths, counterintuitive functions, hidden costs, counterexamples, phase shift triggers
      - add technicality, synchronization, bias, counterintuition, & certainty objects leading to inevitable collisions
        - error of the collision of compounding forces producing a phase shift
        - lack of attention in one driver and false panic in a second driver leading to a car crash given the bases where their processes originate
      - define alignment on interfaces (compounding, coordinating, parallel, similar, etc)
      - add core info objects (core strategies, core assumptions) so you can make a network of graphs for a system
    - concept analysis:
      - how new concepts (gaps in network rules) evolve once structure is applied to prior concepts 
    - interface analysis:
      - limitations of interfaces & how to derive them
      - how rules develop on stability & how foundations are connected & destroyed
      - explainability as a space limited by derivable attributes from data set & cross-system similarity
      - vertex definition & give examples (as an intersection/combination of interface variables, such as determining/description(compressing)/generative/causative/derivation variables), around which change develops
    - change analysis:
      - generated object change types
        - constant to variable
        - variable to removal of assumption in variable type/data type
    - examine implementing your solution type (constructing structures (made of boundary/filter/resource sets) to produce substances like antibodies, using bio system stressors)
    - resolve & merge definitions into docs/tasks/implementation/constants/definitions.json
    - update links
    - integrate archive_notes/finder_info/functions
    - de-duplicate logic
      - organize interface analysis logic definitions
        - organize functions in problem/interface definitions, before organizing functions in implementations/*
      - integrate problem_solving_matching.md
      - integrate find/apply/build/derive logic from system_analysis/ & maps/defs*.json
      - separate interface analysis logic into implementation/functions (functions dont need unique info)
      - add functions from workflows & analysis (to do list, questions answered, problems solved, interface definition & functions) as files in functions/ folder
        - organize into primary core functions & list sample parameters (like objects to identify for the identify function)
      - integrate rules from diagrams in patent applications to relevant documents
            

- examples
      - joke mapping insight paths
        - unlikely hypothetical
          - several degrees of assumption chains to generate an unlikely hypothetical (sequence of assumptions from a starting assumption/premise, generating a background story/context)
            - serious + petty + important: 'none of us can figure out why he tucks in his tie'
              - implies that the problem was so serious that a discussion happened to investigate & research it to fix it
              - implies that no one is allowed to ask him or has the courage to ask him directly, implying he's powerful in some way & cannot be questioned, which implies these are his subordinates who are not doing work in order to discuss this, which implies this could cause their work arrangement to be invalid 
            - 'none of us ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - repeated + important: implies that the discussion was repeated bc it was such an important matter
            - 'none of our lawyers or R&D staff ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - important: adds another level of importance in that they hired an expensive legal team to investigate the matter for liability/indemnity/litigation potential as if it made the company look so bad they had to hire a legal team
            - "the tie-tucking survived ex-girlfriends' interventions"
              - important: it has ruined multiple relationships with people who cared about him who tried to stop him from doing this to himself
              - briefer than previous version & uses more evocative verb
              - different: 
                - add assumption: assumption that the audience is rooting for the tie-tucking to continue
                - add concept of 'agency': attributing personhood to the tie-tucking, which is fighting for its life against cruel monsters
            - 'even after being accused of being a double-tucker who tucks his tie but not his shirt, he persisted'
              - important + petty + similar: fashion is a petty thing to care about this much, and a special jargon term 'double-tucker' implies a whole community or sub-culture based on or caring about this issue or related issues, which he has caused controversy in, with added importance by association from term 'double-agent', typically reserved for high-stakes situations like foreign wars, as if he's betraying someone or his heritage or group or people who rooted for him, and rhymes with a curse word
            - 'the mysterious tie-tucker left the board of directors' 
              - important + reduced: condensing the entire story into a brief structure like a nickname and casually referencing it despite the importance implied in a problem that generates a nickname
        - topics
          - conspiracy theory (a muffling device to prevent the Chinese from listening to his balls chafe for blackmail material)
          - cults/ex's (definitely worshiping the wrong things)
        - total opposite: 'your fatal flaw wasn't so much all the excessive drunk online shopping purchases at the police store & the corporate sabotage so much as the curtains from korea that spied on us & posted our arguments to porn sites' (it was absolutely the excessive spending at the police store)
        - changing definitions to very different alternate definition
          - 'tucked in his tie' or 'used unnecessary protection' or 'packed heat'
        - resolving awkwardness
          - 'i dont hate your dick pics (introduces the problem, 'uh oh does she hate my dick pics'), I just think theyre (foreshadowing something that seems like a difference but is actually similar) more optimal when directed at enthusiasts (or professionals), such as doctors/researchers, who might appreciate it more than I ever could (optional: from a curiousity perspective)'
        - mixed contexts/styles
          - talking about an unimportant matter in the same terms used for important matters
            - 'his parents couldnt deal with the idea of confrontation so they gently let him lose touch rather than disowning him outright' 
        - adding relevant structures of meaning like:
          - aligning layers like double entendres
            - calling him a 'magician' bc they have a function of 'hiding scarves' which is similar to 'tucking a tie' bc 'tucking' has a related output of 'hiding'
        - defeating the purpose/self-defeating
          - listing all the manipulations youre using, while using them, to the target 
        - false dignity/over-generousity
          - calling him a 'international man of mystery' bc its a very dignified way to portray having mysterious fashion habits that defy analysis from subject matter experts
          - 'he must be doing it to scare away women bc theyre always chasing him'
        - injecting stupidity/extremes
          - he thought it would act like a talisman to protect him from rape or unwanted pregnancy
          - he was told by a foreign holy man (has association with 'wise foreigner' stereotype) that it would protect him from fertility like a 'cosmic condom' (repetition, catchy) 
        - removing a point/agency (its not an intent, he just had the clingiest underwear/reproductive organs known to mankind)
        - fitting with existing systems without obvious contradictions
          - 'using existing phrases in a new way with minimal distortions' is surprising bc its unlikely to find a new distortion of an existing component that someone hasnt tried, so the simpler the better for this type
