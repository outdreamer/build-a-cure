  - add formatting to allow multiple items as keys in json and maintain order for interface network paths

  - make tutorial for interface analysis or at least reading list of posts & docs

  - finish pos, clause, modifiers code from find implementation
  - finish network creation function
  - then go back to identification functions

  - processes with time irreversibility:
    - allow a state change within a symmetry's transformation space, without passing time (no change has occurred except law obedience) - a unit of required order
    - guarantees distribution of resources (energy)
    - guarantees destructibility of intelligent energy-hoarding systems (biological life)
    - prevents some powerful energy sources from being accidentally created by intelligent energy-hoarding systems (black holes)
    - allows for variance cascades

  - abstract functions

      - derive combinations & make sure you have full function coverage of all important combinations

        operations = ['find', 'get', 'update', 'apply', 'build', 'combine', 'connect', 'convert', 'balance', 'map', 'match', 'fit', 'filter', 'derive']
        objects = ['strategies', 'questions', 'incentives', 'efficiencies', 'metadata', 'definitions']
        structures = ['paths', 'limits', 'boundaries', 'bonds', 'gaps', 'layers']
        system_objects = ['attributes', 'objects', 'systems', 'sub_systems', 'types', 'functions']

        - check codebase function index for combinations
        - check that you have sample data in json for each combination

      - attribute/object/function match functions
      - specific interface identification function
      - standardization network-framing function to describe a system as a network (the standard structure) & position each object, identifying connecting functions
      - system analysis function (identify boundaries, gaps, limits, layers, incentives/intents/questions, & other system objects)
      - isolation function, representating function/attribute changes independent of system context with respect to position or time (snapshot/state or subset)
      - function to define (isolate an object/concept/function for identification, identify definition routes)

  - give example of each type of problem-solving workflows

    - workflow 1:

      - finish function to determine relevance filter ('functions', 'required') from a problem_step ('find incentives') for a problem definition, to modify problem_steps with extra functions/attributes ('change_position') to be more specific to the problem definition ('find_incentives_to_change_position') for problem_steps involving 'incentives', so you know to use the function_name to modify the problem step if it's between the type 'functions' and the object searched for 'incentives'

      - finish function to get all codebase functions & store them in a dict with their type, context/usage, and intents, just like functions are stored in the problem_metadata.json example for workflow 1
      - finish common sense check
      - finish defining objects in object_schema.json
      - finish organizing functions.json by type, with mapping between general intent functions like 'find' to specific info-relevant terms like 'get'
      - add common phrase check & filter problem steps by repeated combinations with common phrase check
      - finish get_type function to map info to structure using the new functions.json organization
      - finish apply_solution to problem_definition using problem_steps
        - involves building a function to evenly distribute objects (like information/types), given problem positions/agents/objects
      
  - types can be represented as directions (going farther from origin goes further up type stack, where similar types are adjacent)

  - need to fill in content:
    - finish intent/change type calculation for a system intent
    - selecting optimal combination interfaces to start from when solving problems 
      (how many degrees away from core functions, specific layers or sub-systems, what position on causal structures)
    - key questions to filter attention/info-gathering/solution
    - key functions to solve common problem types
    - development of key decision metrics (bias towards more measurable/different metrics rather than the right metric)
    - trajectory between core & important objects
      - example of choosing inefficiencies/exploit combinations in a system
    - research implementing your solution type (constructing structures (made of boundary/filter/resource sets) to produce substances like antibodies, using bio system stressors)
    - emergent combinations of core functions (include derivation of invalidating contexts for core functions)

  - change phases for causal analysis (interim, changing, diverging, standard, efficient state, constant, interacting, converging, on the verge of obsolescence, outlier, etc)
    - superficial cause, alternate cause in the case of a function, addressing input/output causes
  - framing on interfaces, decomposing causation, then identifying parameters of problem on layer & matching solution
  - independence (closed trade loops) as time storage
  - vertex as a pivot point for an interface
