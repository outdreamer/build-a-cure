# to do

    - make diagram of absolute reference connections

    - connection-connecting methods

      - given how values can be connected, how can connections be connected using those value-connecting connections

        - how can connections be formatted as absolute references (numbers) so value-connecting connections can be applied to connect connections

        - given that a function A connects 2 & 10, and so does function B, function B is connected to function A by change types & operations

        - in the space of connections, function A & B have a similarity in position

        - the efficiencies connecting two absolute references may replace another function connecting those references
          - given the adjacence of 2 & 10 to each other, it may be more efficient to use this similarity to connect them (by transforming one to the other) than using other connections (either as similarities or differences) such as multiply by 5 or divide 20 by 10
          - or it may be more efficient to transform 2 to 1 given its similarity to 1 and use unit multiplication (1 * 10 = 10, requiring no change) and transforming 1 back to two through addition (10 + 10 = 2 * 10) rather than multiplying 2 * 10
          - this efficiency is generated from the metadata of these two numbers, metadata that may connect them more efficiently than other operations
            - example queries:
              - "apply the prime interface to connect numbers adjacent to primes" (adjacence given common factor pattern)
              - "apply the unit interface to connect references adjacent to unit references" (adjacence to 1)
              - "apply the difference interface to connect reference differences adjacent to a difference" (the difference between 2 & 10 is adjacent to the difference between 1 & 10)


    - absolute reference connections

      - what is the complete set of unique connections between two values (numbers being absolute references), such as numbers like 2 & 10

        - their metadata is connected with:

          - similarities:

            - components
              - inputs
                - factors (common factors)

            - abstractions
              - types
                - value types (integers)

            - system contexts (relevance through usefulness)
              - applications
                - common usage (commonly used as bases)
                - usage potential (can be used to produce useful functions, sequences, & sets, like even numbers or digit-moving functions)

            - relevant components

              - relevance through adjacence in position
                - adjacent value metadata (both near primes, e, pi, 1, & zero)

              - relevance through interactivity
                - interactive with value-connecting metadata (metadata like number types)
                  - intersections
                    - 2 intersects with primes formatted as a sequential path (sequence of primes) or a network (formatted by adjacence to other primes, adjacence to other high-energy numbers, or other highly connecting metadata) or a function (checking for factors qualifying as those of a prime)
                    - sequence of even numbers

          - differences like:

            - adjacent transforms, formats, & applications

              - usage
                - power
                  - 2 or its inverse is more commonly used as a power than 10 bc its one away from the unit power 1
            
            - difference-reducing connections
              - operations
                - factors connecting the two numbers with multiplication/division like 5 & 20
      
      - these values can store different info with varying optimization/efficiency & varying info loss/preservation
      - given the ways that change types like variables/operations are connected in functions, what functions efficiently connect values like the above pair, using minimal info, and for what intents

    - determine core graph variables (definition of adjacence/difference, connectivity, dimensions, info storage methods, interactivity of structures like sequences)

    - determine connections between useful alternative concepts for formatting (concepts like energy, entropy, random) to work around lack of other interface info
      - energy (in the form of cross-system interface components can be stored in structures varying on cross-system interface component variables
          - components like type, change, similarity, simplicity, stability, ambiguity, symmetry, interactivity, limit, efficiency, connectivity, & info preservation/compression
            - a structure that can store some info has adjacent storage structures that can also store that info or a subset/parameters of it
      - the connectivity of these structures can be determined by the energy preservation/loss from origin/target structure and the structures enabling structures connecting them
      - these concepts are useful & structural enough that they can be used as metadata of a problem/solution that circumvents the need to structurize a problem
        - if you know the energy components of a problem and a solution, you can connect them with energy functions without structurizing the problem
          - example:
            - if a problem is 'optimizing a system that wastes energy or degrades without maintenance processes', and the solution is a method like 'connect energy outputs with energy inputs', these can be connected in either direction using energy metadata of interim steps/structures like 'apply energy usage-reducing components like connections' (to connect inputs/outputs), where energy is defined as common abstract structures like 'source of change', 'output', 'input:output ratio', 'potential', 'robustness'
      - these concepts are useful bc they:
        - can reduce info to its most relevant structures
          - involve structures of relevance (commonness, abstraction, connection)
        - apply to all interface components
          - can be defined across interfaces (with alternative definitions that apply directly to interface components)

  - crypto as community consensus, where a decision can have value if backed by a community

  - problem-causing structures of turing machine (with 'lack of input validation' problem)
    - lack of potential alignment in interpretating vs. applying a component
      - assumption: interpretation & application should be allowed to be different
      - potential for difference allowed in interpretation vs. application
        - potential for difference allowed in character string interpreted as input and character string used as input
    - difference in component attributes that shouldnt exist (should be equal)
      - assumption: 'length of input' equals 'length of string before a function in the form of a function character'
        - if these attributes are equal, the input fulfills the input definition
    - similarity in definitions
      - assumption: the definitions of input/function are not violated
        - if input has functionality or if functions are used as input, the definitions may be violated
    - lack of enforced relevance/meaning
      - assumption: position of function (rather than the meaning of the function, like position in relation to other components) is a reliable indicator of function signals, when only requirements can be used as a reliable indicator & position of functional characters after input string is not required
        - the meaning of the function positioned in the input is different from the meaning of the function after the input
          - the meaning includes different possible intents
    - lack of applied definition
      - assumption: that a structure like position can be used in place of a definition
      - that a variable with a value filter 'input = continuous initial string of characters that dont fulfill the "function" definition, if equal to length of input' shouldnt replace the constant structure 'position of input-terminating character' used to define or differentiate components
    - lack of exclusivity in component alignment (between 'character string' structure and 'input' structure, where 'character string' structure also aligns with 'function' structure, and where 'character string' contains 'position' structures which are used to differentiate input & function structures without interaction rules enforced for position/input/function contents stored in the 'character string' structure system)
      - assumption: that 'character string' is a structure that can be used to contain different components & that 'character position' is a structure that can differentiate them in isolation of other structures, and that those component positions & contents wont overlap, be switched, or otherwise be distorted or conflated
      - that input doesnt contain functional characters
        - lack of typical input validation in the form of variable value limits
    - lack of differentiation between components that should be different by definition
      - assumption: that position can differentiate components
      - that one problem space component (input) cant be adjacently converted into another (function) bc of definition violation
    - lack of enforced structural requirement (sequence of producing functionality by applying functions, rather than by reading input)
      - assumption: that a function not designed to produce functionality in all cases (like reading input) cant be used to produce functionality in all cases
      - that input strings should be convertible into functions without first being processed by a function
    - overlap in functionality that shouldnt exist
      - assumption: that one function cant be used to provide functionality associated with another function
      - conflation of functionality between 'read' function and 'execute' function

    - core problem structures, resolved with solution structures (system optimization rules)
      - excess/unnecessary components 
        - lack of alignment between required & implemented functionality (excess functionality)
      - lack of uniqueness/exclusivity of definitions (definitions shouldnt overlap)
        - system optimization: 
          - ensure that definitions dont overlap or allow ambiguities that are not useful
          - allow only intents that are useful, which dont allow non-useful intents
      - conflict between interpretation vs. application bc of difference that shouldnt exist
        - system optimization: 
          - ensure similarity of interpretation & application of definitions
      - lack of meaning in the form of contextual/system position
        - meaningful position of 'input with function character' differs from position of 'input without function character' in a system
        - system optimization: 
          - the meaningful position of components should be analyzed at other interaction levels, like at a 
            - system level (using system-level integrated metrics) rather than just locally (with local or granular metrics like 'position of function character')
            - function level (using function metrics like 'functionality potential of function convolution/product/sequence')
      - requirement as an indicator of info reliability
        - position isnt required to reliably indicate a component like input/function, but the definition of those components is required to reliably indicate a component
        - system optimization: 
          - apply definitions in identification functions
      - lack of exclusivity in structural intents
        - multi-purpose structure like 'character string' used for multiple purposes (input, function) without differentiating/separating structure (separating input from function)
        - system optimization: 
          - apply multi-purpose structures with differentiating structures to align usage with intent
          - apply multi-purpose containing structures (like 'variable' or 'template') with differentiating sub-structures to organize other sub-structures stored (like 'constant string')
      - lack of alignment between structural limits/potential
        - structural limit of 'character string' doesnt align with the structural potential of its contents (input, function, position, character)
        - system optimization: 
          - align structural limits with potential

  - interfaces that are important bc of generative concepts/structures
    - 'core' interface's generative concept 'simplicity' and related attribute 'composability'
    - 'interface' interface's generative concepts 'interactivity' and 'balance' (how does info from each interface integrate or interact to produce meaning, balancing influence of interfaces in a way thats indicates contribution)
    - 'cause' interface's generative concept 'power' (ability to trigger other components)
    - 'concept' interface's generative concepts 'uniqueness' and 'applicability'
    - 'info' interface's generative concept 'stability' producing info
    - 'intent' interface's generative concepts 'functionality' and 'direction' (functionality develops when there's a reason for it to develop, like a direction of change)
    - 'function' interface's generative concept 'connection' (connecting inputs/outputs)
    - 'pattern' interface's generative concepts 'similarity' (powerful patterns are repeated and patterns develop in similar ways, producing similarities across interfaces)
    - 'logic' interface's generative concept 'alignment' (aligning logical connections with info as a supportive foundation)
    - 'change' interface's generative concept 'difference'
    - 'structure' interface's generative concept 'info' (info about other interfaces with potential for structure)
    - 'potential' interface's generative concept 'adjacence' (what is probable is more adjacent)

    - the generative attributes (simplicity, interactivity, balance, power, uniqueness, applicability, stability, functionality, direction, connection, similarity, alignment, difference, info, adjacence) reflect core structures (unit, value, force, direction, equivalence, distance, rate, ratio, input-output, type, dependency, constant)

  - add to useful concepts

    - bitcoin and ai both benefit from integrating the concept of time into existing inventions (tx history, weight updates)
    - what other concepts could be equally powerful if injected into structures of existing inventions
    - why is time (or the structure of sequence) a powerful concept in those problem systems
      - historical info integrated into current & imminent info was a pre-existing gap in relevant info structures of the problem system
      - the usefulness of historical info wasnt identified or wasnt identified as integratable into existing inventions
      - the related concept of:
        - 'connection' could have served as a replacement, indicating relevance of previous info to new or derived info
        - 'position' could have also replaced 'time' or 'sequence', given the relevance of 'position' as a predictor of financial transactions and connecting one info state to another, given data that can access the destination from that origin
      - its also inherently relevant to know how space-times (states) connect (like in a sequence structure) in order to predict adjacent imminent space-times (or states) as imminent members of the sequence

  - structures like origin/destination points, loops, layers, boundaries, & paths for solving problems (like logistical resource allocation, adding variable to a function, or finding search path (sorting))
    - give examples of problems with relevant structures
      - a question/variable/cause pattern
      - a connected function sequence
      - a set of filters & limits

  - how to identify that more normal language is likelier to contain factual statements

    - multiple interrelated reasons, from the insight path
      1. facts often have simpler connections
      2. language patterns have intents
        3. agents apply language patterns to achieve intent
          4. linguistic intents are often to change meaning until its false (out of the full set of intents to 'communicate info')
          5. agent often over-think how to emphasize/reduce language components and it creates unnatural language patterns
          6. agent-changed language (newly created patterns) is rarely more efficient than normal language patterns (inherited patterns)
            7. when it is more efficient, it is quickly adopted until its normal
            8. more efficient language patterns are likelier to be true, bc of the normally simpler connection patterns of facts 
          9. it takes work to make a set of falsehoods or mix of falsehoods & facts seems like a fact, and the work has side effects like lack of normality (sounding unnatural in structure) or simplicity (using fewer resources to connect components)

    - relevant concepts
      - the concept of 'simplicity' interacts with connections 1, 5, 8, & 9
      - the concept of 'normality' interacts with connections 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9

    - these concepts can be used as almost interchangeable alternatives in generating the interface query generating this insight path

    - despite their differing definitions, simplicity & normality are connected by the concept of efficiency, because what is simple often becomes normal because of the efficiency of simplicity, so efficiency can be used as an interchangeable concept of both of these in some cases

    - interface query to generate the insight path to 'derive an attribute to identify facts'
      - apply concept interface
        - identify important concepts (simplicity, efficiency, emphasis, reduction, falsehood, change, connection, pattern, normality, agency) of the problem system of 'identify facts'
        - apply relevant concepts to problem system
          - agents change language to achieve intents
            - apply intent interface by mapping to intents ('change info' for intent of lying, or 'false similarity to fact')
              - connect intents to original relevant concepts
                - connect problem system component derived from intent interface of 'agent-changed language' to concepts of normality & falsehood

  - add to definitions
    - reason as source cause node ('this happened because of this causal factor')
    - intent as target cause node ('this happened because this intent was the goal used as a cause of the agent's decisions')

  - add to causation variables
    - ability to change (if a variable cant be changed, it is less causative for problem-solving intents)

  - add to problem type structures as 'indistinguishable cause'

    - multiple causes of the same variable

      - example: gravity (no agency, just granular intent of 'apply force to relevant objects') can cause an object to fall, just like throwing it down (concept of agency and intent to 'move object down' or 'move object to ground') can cause it to fall

  - add to false similarity examples
    - set of interactions that are unrelated but appear correlated

      - examples
        - system B has an output that is structural similar to outputs of system A
          - interactions of system B that happen at a later time but their interim outputs may have a structural similarity to the outputs of system A
        - system B may cause a similar or equal output to that of system A, for a different intent/reason
          - if the output is used as a metric, they will seem similar or related

      - efficiencies are a reason (source cause node) that structural similarities occur
        - efficient structures follow patterns that may produce similar structural outputs

  - add to connect function examples
    - how to map connections between two systems
      - standardize structures (like sequential structures such as time), standardizing to either system's structures, interim structures, common structures, interface (like system or core) structures, contextual system-containing system's structures, etc
      - abstract to patterns (like type, cause, system structures)
      - conversion functions (like remove, apply, connect, define)

  - map gravity to similarity (in position) as a calculation efficiency, where calculation efficiencies (like how to minimize surface area or how to apply a key to decrypt info) are an input to information
    - gravity between bulk/boundary creating the mapping of equivalent attributes
      - gravity as:
        - the average or highest-weighted path of interacting paths
        - structure of efficiency through organization 
    - definition: 'structure of minimized surface area as a component of 'entanglement' connecting function of two boundary points'
      - reduced mapping (minimized surface area) is a calculation efficiency to determine boundary position
        - this reduced mapping could be used to connect boundary positions (or their components like an attribute)
    - entanglement as an efficiency to handle risk of information destruction or to handle over efficiency (distribute efficiency (in the form of information) across multiple points)
      - use a mapping efficiency to connect distributed info with structural similarities
    - particles lose their adjacence/similarity bias/efficiency inside the black hole
    - "highest-weighted path from point a to b is the most efficient space-time path, which is not always equal to the 'classical physics' space-time path" (find examples of intents that classical physics is not efficient for)
      - is quantum physics using a different definition of efficiency/similarity or is it using another priority (like energy storage vs. energy usage)
      - how do weighted quantum paths interact with the weighted paths of other particles
    - nonlocality/entanglement as a calculation efficiency in the form of the replica trick
    - wormholes as:
      - calculation efficiencies
      - radiation given off of calculation efficiencies, removing information or filters preventing possibilities
      - sequence of a lack of filters preventing possible paths
      - interfaces (connecting standardizing functions)
      - hidden variables/differences (masquerading as similarities)
    - 'replica trick' as:
      - a way of transferring energy stored in sequential repetition (one coin outcome repeated a number of times in a sequence structure) to energy stored in distributed equivalence (two coins having equal outcome)
    - time as:
      - energy store
        - if time exists, it means change is possible, because energy has been organized in a structure that allows change to occur, meaning structures have developed, meaning efficient structures have been found (organization of energy formats)
        - can you attract other spacetimes so theyre adjacent by storing energy in a way that is adjacent to their storage methods

  - give example of deriving formula with definitions of components 

    - problem metadata

      - problem statement (formula to derive):
        - expected value of the random variable f(x) = actual average of distribution

      - definitions of components:

        - average definition: 
          - sum of all values divided by number of values

        - expected value definition: 
          - average of all possible values, weighted by probability of each possible value
          - expectation is linear

        - p(x) probability density 'distribution sample' definition
          - independent & identically distributed values

      - solution statement:
        - independently & identically distributed samples (data points) from a distribution inside the boundary of the area to estimate, divided by the total number of data points in the distribution is a way to fulfill intent 'approximate area inside boundary'

    - definition connections

      - identify 'probability' as a useful concept to map to problem space:
        - because of structural similarity in probability structures & problem definition (proportion)
        - or as a useful method to find a representative subset to avoid trial & error (or combinationatorial) calculation of area

      - connect concepts of core components ('probability', 'average value', 'sample size', 'data points', 'area') using definitions
        - this should produce the concept of 'convergence' as sample size variable is changed & average value approaches actual area

      - definitions of concept interations
        - 'area' is a related concept to 'probability' when:
          - data points are mapped to possible outcomes
          - problem-solving intent is either:
            - general structure: estimate the proportion of a subset relative to a whole
              - specific structure: estimate the probability of a subset of possible outcomes relative to all possible outcomes

    - alternate routes to derive formula

        - apply conceptual structures

          - apply 'opposite' structure
            - probability of being in the area to estimate
            - probability of not being in the area to estimate

          - apply 'random' structure
            - reduce 'trial & error' solution structure in this problem space of 'testing all possible points' to a subset of all possible points
              - how to select a subset of points
                - extreme points
                - evenly distributed points
                - random selection of points would produce a representative sample of points in a bounded area with increasing accuracy given increasing number of points
                  - randomly distributed points are a way around trial & error of all possible points

        - generate counter-arguments (questions) as filters to reduce error types

          - question every decision, with decision defined as 'variable selections that impact future decisions (future variable selections)'

            - variables

              - method of selecting points
                
                - beginner question: 
                  - why not just generate integer or .1 points starting at origin until all possible outcomes have been covered by an even lattice of points
                - beginner answer:
                  - this introduces bias in the form of an anchored starting point & applies unnecessary meaning to the sequence of points added, which means estimates with low number of points would be biased towards the area around the origin graphable with that number of points
                  - this bias represents a structure of certainty, rather than a way of estimating probability, which by definition is uncertain
                - generate beginner question
                  - apply error type "lack of concept of 'probability'" (indicating an uncertainty like a random distribution, rather than a certainty like a constant in the form of an origin)
                - generate beginner answer
                  - generate differences in between structure posited by beginner and actual requirements
                    - meaning assigned to the origin/sequence is unnecessary and even the opposite of what is required (independent samples that are not connected to subsequence samples in the sequence)
                
                - advanced question:
                  - wouldnt this take a lot of data points to converge to the actual mean

        - apply concept of 'probability' to 2d graph problem space to solve the problem of 'estimating 2d scalar multiplication or summing of 2d scalar multiplication' 

          - probability definition route: 
            - observed x outcomes in proportion to all possible outcomes = probability of x outcome

          - applied concept of 'probability' to 2d graph problem space: 
            - subset of 2d structures (points) in proportion to total set of 2d structures (points) = bounded area


  - resolve definitions of components so you can finishing organizing useful structures like combinations of concepts such as "format sequence", "solution automation workflow", "insight path", "reverse-engineer solution from problem requirements or opposite structures", "connect problem & solution"
    - example useful structures with type stacks
      - format sequence
        - type of structure
        - type of structure that is useful for connecting origin/destination formats 
        - type of structure that is useful for connecting problem/solution formats 
      - solution automation workflow
        - type of insight path
        - type of insight path that is useful for connecting problem/solution
      - insight path
        - useful rule to derive/find/generate insights in a system
      - reverse-engineer solution from problem requirements or opposite structures
        - specific example of a general insight path (like a structural strategy)

    - example connections between useful structures
      - a format sequence can be used to connect any structures
      - an insight path can be used to connect some structures relevantly/efficiently/usefully (like problem/solution structures, input/output structures, origin/destination structures)
      - a solution automation workflow can be formatted as a format sequence

    - example meaning of connections between useful structures
      - because a format sequence can be a connecting structure, it can be used to implement functions with 'connecting' intents

    - change variables to check & complete definitions of interactions between components
      - variables
        - components used:
          - structures: filters, sequences, formats
            - variables: variable selection sequence
            - structures: format sequence
            - functions: conversion/connecting function sequence
        - origin/destination points
          - connect context to problem/solution:
            - start from system in which problem & solution occur (given solution potential) and fit/connect systems gap structures to problem/solution structures, rather than starting from problem & navigating to solution or connecting them in the middle or working in reverse
              - 
          - connect solution components to solution

      - spotify is welcome to build their own app store with their own phones or team up with their coalition to do so
      - add variable 'time sequence' to 'location of power' change:
        - if spotify operates an app store someday, they will set rules to benefit themselves too, just like theyve done in the past
      - offer an alternative to charging app store rate
        - is there a one-click button to migrate from spotify to apple that could replace any difference in taxes on spotify
    - apply conceptual definition filter 'does concept of persecution (and related components of the definition like focus) apply to the behavior (does behavior have a specific target that is the focus of persecution)'

      - if spotify is just charging rent on a catalog, are they adding value to the market, so they should be allowed to dictate the market at all?
      - what products/features would apple develop if they didnt have to pay a fine, and what are those features worth, and are those features required?
    - apply logical fallacy filters

        - apply 'anti-competitive' conceptual definition structures & test if these structures fit the opponent
          - does spotify plan on raising prices at some point or will they keep prices low even if the app store rate holds? are they only keeping prices low to dominate the market & plan on raising prices later? isnt that anti-competitive behavior?
          - if they are so concerned about anti-competitive behavior, why arent they trying to compete by building their own app store? isnt there a risk that the apple app store is sub-optimal and needs to be improved with competition from spotify

        - would the component be created anyway, even with a minor barrier
        - is the component incentivized in the system
        - how much work would you have to do to prevent the component from being generated in the system (it would be created unconditionally, or in what percent of conditions)
        - does that work change the system to an extreme degree (changing its identity/type/intent)

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths (info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight', system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub')
    - define default & core objects necessary for system to function (out of the box, rather than minimal config necessary to derive other system components & assemble)
      - add default functions to solve common problem types
      - alternate utility function implementations have variation potential in the exact operations used to achieve the function intents, but there are requirements in which definitions these functions use because they are inherent to the system. For example, the embodiment may use a specific definition of an attribute (standardized to a set of filters) in order to build the attribute-identification function using a set of filters - but the general attribute definition is still partially determined in its initial version by requirements specified in the documentation, such as a set of core attribute types (input, output, function parameter, abstract, descriptive, identifying, differentiating, variable, constant), the definition of a function, and the definition of conversion functions between standard formats.
