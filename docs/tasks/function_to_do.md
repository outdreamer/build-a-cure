  - fix indexing 'NNP NN NNS1 of JJ JJ JJ2' or postpone to pattern evaluation time
  - fix missing alts
      pattern_index::verb_phrase::plays a |VB NN| role::a NN role
  - fix one-letter alts: pattern_index::phrase_identifier::ALL_N DPC ALL_N |VBG VBD|::N D N V
  - generalize alt logic to use embedded pair finding
  - fix supported stem assignment (endings like 'is': {'functions a', 'acts a', 'plays a', 'operates a', 'works a'})
  - fix charge function ('edit' is assigned positive score)
  - add core clause patterns 
  - fix pattern matching functions
  - finish pos, clause, modifiers code from find implementation

  - identify attribute: attributes can be reduced to 'position', implemented as a:

      - relationship type (relative difference)
      - structure type (shape)
      - change type (generators of difference)

    - the structural network can frame these position differences to capture all attributes
    - add function to derive structures of an object given its attributes/functions (related attribute sets indicating a type or sub-system, etc)

  - identify function: a function can be reduced to a 'change unit'

  - identify object: an object has attributes/functions and is not itself either of those (for standard definition of object, even though both attributes/functions can be framed as objects)

  - after identification functions

    - import rules for selecting interfaces to solve a problem on

      - determine minimum information
      - query for rules making inferences from available information sets
      - Function interface helps find unused functions
      - Intent interface helps predict system priorities & find exploit opportunities
      - System interface helps find efficiencies
      - Pattern interface helps find insight paths/similarities

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths 
      - info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight'
      - system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub'
    - mapping function, to map problems to structures
    - solution decomposition function
    - solution aggregation function

  - abstract functions

      - derive combinations & make sure you have full function coverage of all important combinations

        - check codebase function index for combinations
        - check that you have sample data in json for each combination

      - attribute/object/function match functions
      - specific interface identification function
      - standardization network-framing function to describe a system as a network (the standard structure) & position each object, identifying connecting functions
      - system analysis function (identify boundaries, gaps, limits, layers, incentives/intents/questions, & other system objects)
      - isolation function, representating function/attribute changes independent of system context with respect to position or time (snapshot/state or subset)
      - function to define (isolate an object/concept/function for identification, identify definition routes)

  - give example of each type of problem-solving workflows

    - workflow 1:

      - finish function to determine relevance filter ('functions', 'required') from a problem_step ('find incentives') for a problem definition, to modify problem_steps with extra functions/attributes ('change_position') to be more specific to the problem definition ('find_incentives_to_change_position') for problem_steps involving 'incentives', so you know to use the function_name to modify the problem step if it's between the type 'functions' and the object searched for 'incentives'

      - finish function to get all codebase functions & store them in a dict with their type, context/usage, and intents, just like functions are stored in the problem_metadata.json example for workflow 1
      - finish common sense check
      - finish defining objects in object_schema.json
      - finish organizing functions.json by type, with mapping between general intent functions like 'find' to specific info-relevant terms like 'get'
      - add common phrase check & filter problem steps by repeated combinations with common phrase check
      - finish get_type function to map info to structure using the new functions.json organization
      - finish apply_solution to problem_definition using problem_steps
        - involves building a function to evenly distribute objects (like information/types), given problem positions/agents/objects

  - need to fill in content:
    - finish intent/change type calculation for a system intent
    - selecting optimal combination interfaces to start from when solving problems 
      (how many degrees away from core functions, specific layers or sub-systems, what position on causal structures)
    - key questions to filter attention/info-gathering/solution
    - key functions to solve common problem types
    - development of key decision metrics (bias towards more measurable/different metrics rather than the right metric)
    - trajectory between core & important objects
      - example of choosing inefficiencies/exploit combinations in a system
    - research implementing your solution type (constructing structures (made of boundary/filter/resource sets) to produce substances like antibodies, using bio system stressors)
    - emergent combinations of core functions (include derivation of invalidating contexts for core functions)

  - extra tasks

    - add precomputing if a sub-pattern was already computed:
               'ALL_N ALL_N of ALL_N ALL_N'
         'ALL_N ALL_N ALL_N of ALL_N ALL_N ALL_N'
    - add formatting to allow multiple items as keys in json and maintain order for interface network paths
