# to do

    - apply structures from relevant system (like comedy) to a problem space
      - if its a joke that means its probably not a structure of truth, just like how if it's justified/earned it's likelier to be a stable structure (a component of truth) bc everything has a benefit/cost (so when the right investment matches the right costs, its likelier to achieve the goal)
      - surprising
        - different
        - opposite
        - extreme/exaggerated
        - nonsense
          - not incentivized
          - not normal
        - unusual/weird/unlikely
      - safe
        - reduce common experience/problem/fear or other negative emotion until ridiculous/unimportant/powerless
      - relevant
        - multiple alignments of relevant structures
          - self-fulling prophecy
            - multiple layers of relevance
              - prediction function
                - repeated concepts used in different ways
                  - add 'usage' concept while applying 'usage' function: use prediction function to predict usage
                - relevance cycle: 
                  - prediction function used to determine discussions, which are used to determine usage, which are an input to prediction function to predict usage
                - function usage makes it better at its usage intent
                  - 'prediction function of usage being used as an input to discussions which are an input to usage, so the function/paper is used more often, and becomes more accurate at predicting usage bc its usage predictions made it used more'
                - relevance in the form of usefulness/efficiency structures:
                  - function output (usage predictions) created a function input (usage)
                - the opposite would be ridiculous self-defeating structures:
                  - function output (high access & site crash from server overload) prevented a function input (using the paper)
        - aligning
          - actual intent & stated intent align (sincerity)
          - relevance structures align (at same intervals/points)
        - useful
          - connected
          - common/relatable
          - timely
          - efficient
          - similar
          - true
            - obvious
            - sincere
      - important
        - emotional
        - petty
        - serious
      - easily understood
        - brief
        - uses references that are commonly known
      - ridiculous
        - invalid/illegitimate
        - self-defeating
        - pointless/not useful
        - irrelevant
        - ineffective
        - drastically/obviously false
          - conspiracy theories connect objects that are obviously not connected

      - insight paths
        - unlikely hypothetical
          - several degrees of assumption chains to generate an unlikely hypothetical (sequence of assumptions from a starting assumption/premise, generating a background story/context)
            - serious + petty + important: 'none of us can figure out why he tucks in his tie'
              - implies that the problem was so serious that a discussion happened to investigate & research it to fix it
              - implies that no one is allowed to ask him or has the courage to ask him directly, implying he's powerful in some way & cannot be questioned, which implies these are his subordinates who are not doing work in order to discuss this, which implies this could cause their work arrangement to be invalid 
            - 'none of us ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - repeated + important: implies that the discussion was repeated bc it was such an important matter
            - 'none of our lawyers or R&D staff ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - important: adds another level of importance in that they hired an expensive legal team to investigate the matter for liability/indemnity/litigation potential as if it made the company look so bad they had to hire a legal team
            - "he kept tucking in his tie despite every ex-girlfriends' intervention"
              - important: it has ruined multiple relationships with people who cared about him who tried to stop him from doing this to himself
            - 'even after being accused of being a double-tucker who tucks his tie but not his shirt, he persisted'
              - important + petty + similar: fashion is a petty thing to care about this much, and a special jargon term 'double-tucker' implies a whole community or sub-culture based on or caring about this issue or related issues, which he has caused controversy in, with added importance by association from term 'double-agent', typically reserved for high-stakes situations like foreign wars, as if he's betraying someone or his heritage or group or people who rooted for him, and rhymes with a curse word
            - 'the mysterious tie-tucker left the board of directors' 
              - important + reduced: condensing the entire story into a brief structure like a nickname and casually referencing it despite the importance implied in a problem that generates a nickname
        - conspiracy theory (a muffling device to prevent the Chinese from listening to his balls chafe for blackmail material)
        - cults/ex's (definitely worshiping the wrong things)
        - changing definitions 
          - 'tucked in his tie' or 'used unnecessary protection' or 'packed heat'
        - mixed contexts/styles
          - talking about an unimportant matter in the same terms used for important matters
            - 'his parents couldnt deal with the idea of confrontation so they gently let him lose touch rather than disowning him outright' 
        - adding relevant structures of meaning like:
          - aligning layers like double entendres
            - calling him a 'magician' bc they 'hide scarves' which is similar to 'tucking a tie' bc 'tucking' has a related output of 'hiding'
        - false dignity/over-generousity
          - calling him a 'international man of mystery' bc its a very dignified way to portray having mysterious fashion habits that defy analysis from subject matter experts
          - 'he must be doing it to scare away women bc theyre always chasing him'
        - injecting stupidity/extremes
          - he thought it would act like a talisman to protect him from rape or unwanted pregnancy
          - he was told by a foreign holy man that it would protect him from infertility (has association with 'wise foreigner' stereotype)
        - removing a point/agency (had the clingiest underwear/reproductive organs known to mankind)
        - fitting with existing systems without obvious contradictions
          - 'using existing phrases in a new way with minimal distortions' is surprising bc its unlikely to find a new distortion of an existing component that someone hasnt tried, so the simpler the better for this type

      - these can be used to filter for other non-comedy problems
        - surprise as a learning/prediction tool
          - structures of surprise & truth are useful insight paths to generate solutions
          - structures of surprise & falsehood are useful solution filters
            - conspiracy theories are so unlikely bc they go against incentives or apply an inefficient connection path
              - why would someone go to all that trouble to do that when its way easier to use this other method
        - structures of disincentives (that go against incentives) can be used to find info hiding spots
        - agent behaviors that are extreme in most ways (extremely dignified, pointless, ineffective) are less likely (uncommon) so theyre a source of surprise/comedy
        - structures of safety/stability can be used as a filter to identify possible/probable interactions

    - add to solution automation workflow

      - generating problem/solution structures in a problem space or a system

      - generating problem structures of a problem space like 'find a function for an intent':
        
        - apply error type definition routes
          - error type: missing component
            - if this error type is relevant to the problem space, that means the component was relevant in some way (like being required)
        
        - apply error type-generating functions
          - error type-generating functions:
            - 'change components'
              - components
                - variable values
                  - inputs
                    - to generate a problem type of 'missing input', apply 'change' function or 'opposite' structure to 'input' structure
                  - attribute values
                   - to generate a problem type of 'missing attribute' (such as an attribute required for a solution metric), apply 'change' function or 'opposite' structure to 'attribute' structure

      - example: identifying structural causes of problem type 'false success info signals': 

        - problem type of 'excess specificity' can create a problem of 'false success info signals'

        - granular/specific solutions are often insufficient, where the granularity can take the form of problem structures:
          
          - handling problematic output instead of input: fixing a specific instance of a problem (an output generated by a problem-generating function call, like a particular position of a problem side effect) instead of all instances of a problem (the problem-generating function)
          - position on a problem network: fixing a problem without regard to other related problems, such as causative problems, adjacent problems, or problems that will replace or re-generate the problem once its fixed/removed
          - specific instance of a type: fixing a specific type of a problem instead of all possible types
          - multiple intents: fixing one particular problematic usage of a function, without fixing other problematic uses of a function
          - lack of unique cause: fixing one cause of a multi-cause problem without fixing other causes
          - artificial constant: assigning one constant value when a variable is required to fix the problem
          - unhandled potential: fixing the problematic function without handling the adjacent problematic function it can be adjacently converted into
          - unhandled context: fixing the problem in a particular problem space context, without handling the adjacent problem space the original problem space is about to become
          - specific state: fixing the problem for a specific state in a data flow rather than all possible states
          - specific success definition: fulfilling one metric when multiple metrics are needed to assess solution success

        - you can generate the above problem structures (like 'multiple intents') for a problem type by:
          
          - applying interface components to the problem type concept of 'specificity' (with general problem type 'excess' applied to this concept for a resulting problem type 'excess specificity') in useful (common/general/interface) problem spaces like 'finding a function'
          - then filtering the resulting structures by which structures would qualify as problems, given the definition routes of the concept of 'problem' (like 'structures that are sub-optimal for some legitimate intent, like fulfilling a particular metric')
          
        - to find specific problem structures of a general problem type, apply other useful problem spaces than 'finding a function' (finding a 'connection' structure)

          - where a 'problem space' can be the context associated with having a problem, like how the problem space of the problem of 'finding a function' is the set of systems where that problem would occur, systems potentially including a network of related problems like 'finding connections' and 'predicting outputs' such as:
          
          - problem spaces specific to an interface:
            - cause: find cause (as an indirect input to a function)
            - structure: find limits/filters of function inputs/logic
            - system: find assumptions of function (as a related input to a function)
          
          - problems applying interface components (like applying 'abstraction' concept to the 'finding a function' problem space to create the abstract version 'finding a structure')
            - apply 'abstraction' concept to the 'finding a function' problem space to create the abstract version
              - problem space: finding/fitting a structure
              - apply intent component & related concepts like 'useful':
                - problem space: finding a useful structure for an intent
              - apply 'abstraction' concept to 'structure' ('definition' is an abstraction of 'structure', just like 'constant' or 'info' are other abstractions of 'structure')
                - problem space: finding a definition
               - apply 'abstraction' to all components until it reaches the 'interface' interaction level
                - find an interface component in a structure ('find a concept like relevance in a structure')
            
            - apply 'interface' interface concepts ('organization' being a related concept of 'structure' & 'interface', just like 'integration' and 'relevance' are related concepts of the 'interface' interface, where concepts related to 'disorder' like 'random' are the opposing concepts of 'organization') to interface components ('structures')
              - organize/randomize structures
            
            - apply abstract core 'info' interface components related to the abstraction of the problem (like problem/solution types, formatted as abstract core functions), instead of a specific problem's ('find connecting function') component interaction structures ('functions connecting input-output')
              - select between solution types (generate/derive/find)
            
            - apply 'combination' structure and 'complete' concept and 'system context' component
              - find all the possible ways to connect two structures & all the info structures necessary to connect them with those methods
            
            - apply 'interaction' concept to 'connection' structure
              - find all the possible structures (like networks) that could convert a 'find a connection between input-output' problem into a 'integrate input-output connection methods with these other structures so they can coexist' problem
                - example: 'find a function' problem can interact with a network of problems, like the 'prevent logic injection' problem, 'prevent execution interruption' problem, etc, so it becomes a problem structure that is not simply finding a connecting path between inputs/outputs but a layered network structure of 'finding the connecting structures, while preventing interfering interactions from this problem network'

    - add to nn

      - ai has added concepts since its first implementation bc the first implementation (multi-layer perceptron) was not enough & other functions needed to be embedded to optimize for certain tasks
        - which functions/components need to be added for which tasks is still not a solved problem in the ai space, whereas my system does solve that

      - ai has still not derived the concept of an interface & generated its own interface structure to solve a problem, without being fed the definition of an interface, which is an input to my system
        - if ai was the optimal structure, it would have quickly identified the useful components of my system (like trade-offs, exploits, efficiencies, ambiguities, definitions & interfaces) & applied them to solve any problem, but most ai algorithms/parameters cant do even one task with perfect accuracy (or total coverage, like 90% accuracy & an explanation of why it cant achieve higher accuracy - like 'insufficient data')
        - my system can identify when minimal info to solve a problem isnt reached & can generate explanations of its processes (interface queries, which are trajectories on the 'interface' interface)

      - ai depends on insight path algorithms like 'trial & error' to accomplish some tasks like in grid search to find optimal algorithm parameters, but still must be told to do so by a human who has decided that exploring all parameter combinations is needed
        - theyre wrong to think that, they should have come up with my method to filter a solution space using interfaces & solution automation workflows
        - a 'function network' is only useful if a human puts it in the right system & applies it in the right way to solve the problems its optimized for, and retires it when better methods are implemented - the function network doesnt get better at solving all problems just by being fed more problems
        - my system self-optimizes as its given more problems to solve

      - a function network can sometimes be replaced by an object (interface components) or variable network (of interface variables) but ai wouldnt figure this out if it was given a function network as its origin algorithm, bc while learning how to optimize for a particular solution, ai is not evaluating how to optimize its own algorithm, input, & parameters and would need to be instructed to do so
        - then it would encounter error types and it would need to be instructed to identify & handle error types
        - then it would be linked with other models, data, & function networks, and other interaction error types would emerge and it would need to be instructed on how to handle new data, integrate with other function networks for useful agent intents without merging with other function networks (which would remove its connection to the original tasks it solved), help other models avoid new error types while identifying & handling them itself
        - it wouldnt just identify that it should apply concepts like 'meaning' in its integrations with other automation components, it would have to be told to do so & told how to do so
        - a structural definition of 'meaning' is an input to my system, so my system does have methods to handle complex integration/organization tasks bc these are components of meaning

      - ai depends on my system in order to predict error types better, integrate common sense, apply definitions of concepts, etc

      - my system can generate error types & apply different solution automation workflows as needed to solve a problem, and identify the workflow likeliest to be useful before applying it

      - a function network depends on input data, whereas my system depends on problems, definitions, the logic of interface queries, & an internet connection to find new info as it identifies its own need for new info

      - examples of functions that are sub-optimal for a task but get it done (or appear to do so) without immediately invalidating side effects
        - an approximation method isnt as useful as a correct method built on cross-interface understanding
        - attacking a known security vuln by deploying a code fix specific to that vuln doesnt address the problem of identifying/preventing vulns automatically or identifying/preventing hackers from having/using reasons to hack
        - playing whack-a-mole with exploit structures & exploitative agents doesnt address the causative problems of a conflict between agent intents & a lack of coexistence/cooperating/coordination structures
        - paying ransomware hackers as a 'recover lost data' function doesnt address the related problems of risks like that they wont or cant return data or will return it in error (partial/unusable) state & common hacker intents like making money rather than fixing problems and the incentive to move on to next victim or next scam rather than helping victims without ability to enforce data recovery
      
    - what generates understanding? specific interface concepts integrated into the solution, with examples showing understanding (of interface components like interactions/systems in general, & of the problem space), like:
      - abstraction: 
        - handle the problem type 'unhandled problem variants of a problem type' by abstracting the solution
      - intent: 
        - handle the problem type 'conflicting agent intents' by restricting the intent applicability of the solution (what intents are supported by the function)
      - system:
        - handle the problem type 'solution used in different context to enable malicious intents' by applying system context filters to enable applying the solution in specific contexts
      - change: 
        - handle the problem type 'unexpected changes to inputs, logic changes at execution time, or changes applied to change usage of outputs' by enforcing validation of function version, input validation, and validation of output integration with other solutions
      - organization: 
        - handle the problem type 'sub-optimal interaction of solution with other components' by applying simulations of interactions with other components

    - a good solution shows that it was built with understanding of these interface components, including components like:
      - concepts like 'malicious intent', 'organization', 'relevance', 'probability', and 'integration'
      - problem types like 'conflicting incentives' and 'contradictory neutralizing functions' and 'structure vs. flexibility trade-off'
      - system components like 'similarities', 'standards', 'opposite structures', 'interaction layers'
      - function structures like 'useful input-output sequences' & 'core functions'
      - change components like 'vertex variables' and 'adjacence'
      - common/useful structures like 'maps between interfaces'

    - the relevant structures for a problem (like related problem types & structures of those related problem types) should be generated & applied until understanding is reached
      - at this point, once it has understanding, a neural net can solve problems like:
        - why is the user using a neural net to solve this problem
          - example: 
            - why is the user using an AI to solve a problem of differentiating cat/dog photos, if the photos are very clearly separable, meaning the problem doesnt require AI
            - bc the process of using AI is solving a different problem for the user than sorting cat/dog photos, such as different outputs of an AI model, like:
              - time usage: looking busy at work
              - authority: using AI as a source of truth/authority ('the AI said it was true so it must be true')
            - by knowing about system & related system components like 'usage' and 'context' and 'agent', as well as other related interface concepts like 'intent', the AI can infer that AI model outputs (given a definition of AI models) might be the intent of the user
            - alternatively, by knowing that sometimes a problem type of 'different origin/target (like a different cause/reason/intent) is more relevant than the direct/stated origin/target' applies to a context, it can infer that the user has a different origin/target (like a different output of the AI than the AI model itself, or the completion of the task)

    - with regard to using the structure of a filter network as a filter for useful info contributing to a function, other info & info formats are useful & derivable which can be derived with faster means (definitions, bases, subsets, concepts, error types, intents, opposite structures, efficiencies, alternatives)
    
    - nn to derive error types & bias incorporated into other nn data/parameters/algorithms/structures/models

  - visualizing higher dimensions with changes in a network of visualizable variable subsets like:

    - dimension subsets: displaying dimension subsets in groups of sizes that are already visualizable (from 1 - 4 dimensions), where orthogonality is preserved across the network of subsets
    - dimension groups: grouping similar dimensional changes into a change type across a dimension subset, to visualize the change types
    
    - relevant (robust) dimensions
      - dimension invalidations: grouping invalidating/neutralizing change types
      - causative dimensions: just visualizing higher-impact/causal dimensions
      - vertex dimensions: graphing variables as differences from vertex variables
    
    - mapping dimensions: group value sets as other structures like points or networks in a space where change types like 'continuous change' are supported
      - embedded dimensions: dimensions graphed visually using extra dimensions as parameters
      - base dimensions: dimensions standardized to a base and graphed in alignment, like multiple functions on a graph with a common base
      - mapping other dimension metadata: interactions between dimensions units/change types/limits/definitions are graphed
      - abstract dimensions: abstract value structures are graphed ('a point on a line') instead of specific values in a dimension
      - constant dimensions: adjacent limiting constant dimensions are graphed instead of dimensions of change

    - dimension interactions: 
      - interactive dimensions: dimensions that interact are condensed into an input/output of the interaction structure, and input/output dimensions are graphed instead
      - dimension interaction structures: structures of interactions between variables (like direction/circuits/networks) are preserved, where values may be lost
        - dimensional difference: difference between dimensions is graphed instead of different dimensions & values, where dimension values are structures associated with graphed dimension interactions
        - conversion requirements: conversion requirements to a visualizable shape are graphed instead of actual dimensions/values
        - interaction structures between value structures like positions on dimensions when graphed as a standardized shape
          - example: with dimensions formatted as a standardized form like 'lines of equal length, & values as points on these lines', the interaction structure would be the lines connecting the points on the dimension lines, when arranged in any order

  - possible components of a scalable definition include components framed in terms of interactions with other components that can be used with a consistent measurement (like a stable structure) & can also scale (boundaries), rather than framing them in terms that can have different meanings at different parameters (closed, hollow)

  - apply solutions and/or associated error types as a way to derive the origin component type
    - given solutions (with associated error types solved by the solution), derive what problem types existed to trigger the application of the solution (can be constructed from those error types, where error types can cause/build the original problem or address sub-problems of the original problem or related problems)
    - example:
      - given that an agent delegates instead of trying to solve a problem, it is implied that: 
        - 'their previous alternate solution methods have caused error types rather than resolving them'
        - 'delegation has worked for them before'
        - the fact that either of these are likely explanations can be derived with additional information like:
          - their decision patterns
          - adjacent information like:
            - 'having more info about delegation processes'
            - 'more info about alternate solution method error types than delegation error types'
      - given an error type of "delegation problems (like 'misallocation', 'uneven distribution of work', or 'micromanagement')", we can infer that:
        - 'alternate solutions to delegations have been tried'
        - 'delegation was an adjacent solution at the time of solution selection'
        - 'this is a problem not suited to delegation'
        - 'excess work requirements is an origin problem type'

  - why are certain structures of structures more useful
    - bc by definition (of usefulness), they reduce differences between origin & target
    - a 'function that identifies causative ability of a change type (variable)' is by definition useful to solving a problem of 'find causes of dependent variable' bc it connects the component 'cause' of the problem with interim objects like independent variables, which interact with other problem components like 'dependent variable'
    - some structures are more useful in general (rather than for a specific intent) bc the intents they are useful to are themselves more general or more common
    - 'finding structures of alignment' is useful in general bc structures of alignment solve problems of difference/conflict, which are common problem structures
    - useful problem-solving structures can be found by which structures of structures solve common problem structures

  - another useful concept is 'improvement of a problem metric' vs. 'solving a problem'
    - where the problem is that a spectrum metric like accuracy/robustness is not equal to or beyond a correct value, a solution can take the form of improvement
    - 'a component that improves a problem but doesnt solve it' is a useful interim or alternative structure to position as the target, when error/solution types are not structural
    - example: 
      - an approximation function improves a 'missing information about dependent variable y' problem but doesnt solve it (the 'actual prediction function for y' would solve it)
      - a buoy improves a 'drowning' problem but probably doesnt solve it (a 'method of getting to land' would solve it, which the buoy is unlikely to be except in rare contexts or with extreme/distorted/stretched definitions)
      - a 'fitting structure' improves a 'gap' problem but doesnt solve it (a 'method of preventing & correcting gaps' would solve it, like a 'method of preventing slices/knots & other structures that qualify as gap error types')

  - map math terms to problem components as default connecting structures other than core/interface structures
    - cycle: error type of a structure, involving a unique variable subset that can be used to derive the original structure when combined with other unique variable subsets
    - knot: structure with a gap error type where the structure's subset forming the gap allows other subsets of the structure to fill the gap
    - manifold: structure that preserves its error types when a specific set of change types are applied
    - topology: structure connecting subsets & a set, with core components of structural changes having no gap error types (continuous), having:
      - including limits in the form of including subset combinations & subset intersections determining included structures
      - excluding limit error type structure: 'combined/intersecting elements being excluded', or the opposite structure of the limit error type 'non-combined (isolated), non-intersecting (non-common) elements being included'
    - solving a problem by applying filters to the solution space converts the problem into a sorting/set problem structure, applying organization to the definition of the problem & solution so they can be accurately related
    
  - core relationship structure types between problem/solution, by applying core structural relationship structures (relevant to core general abstract-intent functions like apply/find/build/organize/derive)

    - the relevant (meaning core/causative/determining/abstract/invalidating) difference type between the problem/solution can point to an adjacent function to correct the difference
    - example for problem 'too many variables (too much complexity)' and solution 'method of reducing variables without losing accuracy or robustness'
      - a core difference type between problem & solution: variable count
      - a causative difference type: lack of understanding
      - a determining difference type: whether additional variables add accuracy or robustness
      - an abstract difference type: whether these function types (a complex prediction function and a variable reduction function) can interact without additional changes (a variable reduction function can be a generator of a prediction function)
      - an invalidating difference type: whether complex & simple solution types (function types) can both be useful for the same problem

    - core problem-solution relationship types:
      - organize
        - position
          - the solution is the problem components in the right position in a structure (like an object-function or variable network)
        - sequence: 
          - the problem is the solution with a 'sort' applied
      - apply
        - usage (space used vs. allowed by structure)
          - gap: 
            - the problem is the solution with a 'gap' error type corrected
            - the solution is the removal of the problem 
            - the solution resolves the problem of a lack
          - limit
            - the solution is some change applied to the problem that doesnt intersect with a limit or exist on a particular side of the limit
        - change
          - the solution is some structure of change applied to the problem
        - context

      - find
        - identify
          - inclusion/exclusion
            - subset/set: (partial/complete)

              - core structure
                - the solution is the core components of the problem
            - group (combination):
              - the solution is some combination of problem components
          - fit (count/value)
            - reduce/expand
              - the solution is a subset/superset of the problem variables
              - abstract structure:
                - the solution is an example/type of the problem
          - comparison:
            - equal (balance):
              - the solution is some change applied to the problem and/or solution that equates the solution to the problem (as opposed to 'connecting' the problem/solution)
              - connect (path): 
                - solve the problem by connecting the problem & the solution
            - difference structure:
              - the solution is differences between the solution & the problem reduced/expanded or added/removed (as opposed to 'connecting' the problem/solution)
              - opposite: 
                - the problem is the opposite of ('not') the solution
                - the solution is different from error structures
              - invalid
                - the solution is a lack of a valid version of the problem in the problem space (the problem cant exist in the problem space given a definition of 'valid' including validation rules)
              - undefined
                - the solution is a lack of problem definition (the problem is abstract rather than clearly defined, or structural, in the problem space)
              - empty
                - the solution is a lack of the problem (the problem has no possible value in the problem space)
            - similarity (alignment):
              - the solution is some change applied to the problem that convert the problem into a useful component (an alignment with a useful intent)
              - the solution makes the origin position more similar to the target position
              - the solution is some coordinating structure (like a complement) with the problem that converts the problem into a non-problem
      - build/cause:
        - input/output      
          - the solution is some change applied to the problem that produces or is produced by a structure (like an interaction)
          - origin/target structure (sub-structure of input/output)
            - the solution is some change that resolves the difference (reduces distance) between origin/target, connects origin/target, or makes conversion between origin/target trivial
            - the solution is changing the origin or target position/structure so the problem is more solvable or reduced
      - derive
        - abstract reverse input/output direction
          - the solution is the generalized path from an example solution to the problem definition

  - ml explanation of finding coefficients of prediction function by applying distortions to coefficients & ruling out distortions that dont contribute to prediction accuracy
    - can be optimized with reductions like:
      - 'calculating the most different distortions that will reduce possible values the quickest & applying those distortions'

  - add other interfaces to ml problem space (beyond intent interface)
    
    - interface interface
      
      - calculating perspectives (interfaces with intent, including interface components like origin-target differences & important concepts/priorities/filters) of the ml problem/solution space and applying them to generate a structure that applies multiple perspectives, like the:
        - possibility perspective
          - random/corrupted: the possibility that each or a subset of data points is incorrect/corrupted or random
          - incomplete: the possibility that variables are missing
          - distorted/extreme: the possibility that variable ranges are misrepresented by the data
          - conditional functions: the possibility that multiple alternate functions of the input variables apply in different conditions which can be parameterized
        - opposite x intent perspective
          - rather than solving the problem of 'trying to differentiate between categories', solve problem of 'trying to merge categories'
        - opopsite x direction x abstract (type) perspective
          - rather than trying to categorize from image, try to derive image template types from category & definitions
        - difference x pattern perspective
          - apply difference type interaction patterns to augment data to strengthen prediction function
      
      - finding variables enabling the selected perspectives & generating network algorithm/structure from those variables

    - structure interface
      - alignment
        - what alignments exist between ml network algorithms/structures and:
          - problem components like 'uncertainty reduction' intents (networks that have differentiation, missing info derivation, or de-randomizing side effects)
          - boundaries of interacting solution metric requirement structures
    
    - core interface
      - what components of algorithms exist that can be used to construct algorithms on demand
    
    - function interface
      - what input/output interactions exist between ml network structures/config/algorithms that allow for functionality to develop
    
    - cause interface
      - what causal structures (dependencies, direct/unique/ambiguous causation, alternate causes, proxy causes, causal metadata like degree) exist between ml network structures/config/algorithms, such as:
        - input-output sequences where each component causes (builds, leads to, enables, activates/triggers, supplies requirements of subsequent components)
        - core components which can be used to construct a system/object
    
    - concept interface
      - specificity of ml solutions, which can be generalized to handle more cases
        - unsupervised classifiers identify difference type as defined by a distance definition (distance from center/average/nearest neighbor)
          - generalized form:
            - classifier that identifies multiple difference types (differences within variable subsets, distance from other clusters/average/neighbors, etc) to support various intents (like probability of accuracy in identification/differentiation)
        - supervised classifiers identify difference type as defined by difference from labeled training samples
          - generalized form:
            - classifier that identifies multiple differences, within labeled attributes & category/type definitions, between type definitions, and difference patterns between types

  - is a network the best structure for implementing ml?
    - standard: an ANN network has: 
      - causation: direction linking input/output
      - changing parameters, starting from a standard origin: weight distortions
      - solution filters: applied distortion filters to select the distortions that contribute to prediction accuracy
    - alternate: 
      - other networks can be added to handle conditions where alternate functions can be applied
      - a decision network can be applied to determine when decisions are made to switch to an alternate network (where data contributes to prediction accuracy of an alternate function instead of the current one)
    - subset/core: 
      - sub-networks or core network components can be added to handle resolution of subset/core component interactions
      - a decision network can be applied to determine when sub-sets or core component interactions need resolution, like reducing common factors of input variables with standardization
    - combination:
      - integration structures can include a decision network to determine when components should be combined
    - filters:
      - filters or limit structures can be used to reduce what doesnt contribute to prediction accuracy or cant be applied by default (solution cant merge variables from alternate functions)
    
    - the core structure of a network is 'connection', with related structures 'position', 'direction', and 'filters'
      - a problem & solution can be 'connected' using a structure (like a sequence or network) of formats
      - other structural insight paths can be used to derive solutions
        - find solution by applying solution metric structures like structures of a priority
        - find solution by applying core structures available in problem space
        - find solution by applying system structures like ambiguity & incentive
      - these can also be applied to the ml problem space

  - add to reasons why variable or object network (including all terms like a language map, or a subset of relevant terms to the problem) can be insufficient/inefficient, while it can be used as a format to solve problems in general just like vectors can
      - a language map of operators used by a set of functions would have many overlaps & complicated paths between operators, resulting in unclear directions that functions move in or move inputs toward
      - an object network cannot clearly show all the possible object states (or the system contexts producing those object states)
      - the network is an absolute reference structure with static positions of terms/variables/objects, with a definition of difference or interaction applied to the objects to determine position, a position that may not be ideal for making a particular solution path or interaction sub-network clear

      - variable networks may illustrate attributes & direction of cause, but they dont illustrate:
        - why something is true
          - 'structure of an input' may cause a variable like the 'output of an interaction with another structure', but why is that true - bc:
            - structure enforces limits on interaction potential
            - structure allows similarities & alignments between fitting structures to interact
            - structure allows contradictory structures to damage other structures
          - these are system objects that arent displayed in a variable network with an arrow between an input structure & another structure, with an arrow leading to the side effects & other outputs of that interaction
        - you can add other layers to the variable network to show variables on other interfaces like cause to display reasons why something is true, other than a factual variable network displaying known interactions of components of facts, but this makes it not just a variable network, but a stacked/layered variable network, like how a state network has multiple layers and isnt restricted to one network
        - if you illustrate all interface interactions on one network, it might be unusable bc of the density of interactions
          - the above example has many patterns associated with it, many possible intents, many attributes/functions, many adjacent potential interactions & states & other interface objects
          - these objects can be indexed on the same network, but for quick queries, sorting through all of these objects may not be efficient
          - its also not efficient to store possible adjacent states of an object or its many sets of objects that can generate it or be generated by it in the same network
        - an object network is good for showing known interactions between objects, just like a variable network is good for showing known interactions between variables
        - the merging of all these networks is not efficient, for example when displaying an attribute like 'usefulness' 
          - this attribute may be a property of many objects, and it may be a property of structures of objects (like a system of objects)
          - the attribute also has definition routes associated with it
          - these interactions would be inefficient to display on the same network
          - the structure of the attribute definition routes (on a network of standardized concise definition components like concepts on a language network) would require different structures than objects with that attribute as a property
          - the structures of usefulness defined as the attribute's definition routes may not show up exactly the same on an object or other network 
          - a definition route of usefulness may interact with concepts like relevance & alignment, concepts that may not be displayed on a merged network in a clear way that shows the definition route
            - relevance & alignment are fundamental & therefore common concepts/structures that will show up frequently in a variable or other network, in structures that dont align with their definition routes
          - 'alignment' may involve pairs of objects that make up most of the network - showing how 'usefulness' is defined in terms of 'alignment' (connecting 'usefulness' to those pairs of objects indicating alignment structures) will look differently on that network than on the language network of definition routes
          - so a query to find 'alignment' in a merged variable/object network (that includes all interface components) would have to select between the language network version of 'alignment' (definition routes between concepts) and the structures of 'alignment' found on the object/variable network (pairs of objects), which is less efficient and clear than designing an interface query to select these sub-queries beforehand (like 'standardize object network to concepts & match concepts with alignment definition route')
        - a merged network implies that all possible useful info has already been generated & added to the network, whereas interface queries involve operations that can find/derive new info

    - make diagram of absolute reference connections with metadata structures like networks/paths

  - determine core graph variables (definition of adjacence/difference, connectivity, dimensions, info storage methods, interactivity of structures like sequences)

  - crypto as community consensus, where a decision can have value if backed by a community

  - interfaces that are important bc of generative concepts/structures
    - 'core' interface's generative concept 'simplicity' and related attribute 'composability'
    - 'interface' interface's generative concepts 'interactivity' and 'balance' (how does info from each interface integrate or interact to produce meaning, balancing influence of interfaces in a way thats indicates contribution)
    - 'cause' interface's generative concept 'power' (ability to trigger other components)
    - 'concept' interface's generative concepts 'uniqueness' and 'applicability'
    - 'info' interface's generative concept 'stability' producing info
    - 'intent' interface's generative concepts 'functionality' and 'direction' (functionality develops when there's a reason for it to develop, like a direction of change)
    - 'function' interface's generative concept 'connection' (connecting inputs/outputs)
    - 'pattern' interface's generative concepts 'similarity' (powerful patterns are repeated and patterns develop in similar ways, producing similarities across interfaces)
    - 'logic' interface's generative concept 'alignment' (aligning logical connections with info as a supportive foundation)
    - 'change' interface's generative concept 'difference'
    - 'structure' interface's generative concept 'info' (info about other interfaces with potential for structure)
    - 'potential' interface's generative concept 'adjacence' (what is probable is more adjacent)

    - the generative attributes (simplicity, interactivity, balance, power, uniqueness, applicability, stability, functionality, direction, connection, similarity, alignment, difference, info, adjacence) reflect core structures (unit, value, force, direction, equivalence, distance, rate, ratio, input-output, type, dependency, constant)

  - add to useful concepts

    - bitcoin and ai both benefit from integrating the concept of time into existing inventions (tx history, weight updates)
    - what other concepts could be equally powerful if injected into structures of existing inventions
    - why is time (or the structure of sequence) a powerful concept in those problem systems
      - historical info integrated into current & imminent info was a pre-existing gap in relevant info structures of the problem system
      - the usefulness of historical info wasnt identified or wasnt identified as integratable into existing inventions
      - the related concept of:
        - 'connection' could have served as a replacement, indicating relevance of previous info to new or derived info
        - 'position' could have also replaced 'time' or 'sequence', given the relevance of 'position' as a predictor of financial transactions and connecting one info state to another, given data that can access the destination from that origin
      - its also inherently relevant to know how space-times (states) connect (like in a sequence structure) in order to predict adjacent imminent space-times (or states) as imminent members of the sequence

  - structures like origin/destination points, loops, layers, boundaries, & paths for solving problems (like logistical resource allocation, adding variable to a function, or finding search path (sorting))
    - give examples of problems with relevant structures
      - a question/variable/cause pattern
      - a connected function sequence
      - a set of filters & limits

  - how to identify that more normal language is likelier to contain factual statements

    - multiple interrelated reasons, from the insight path
      1. facts often have simpler connections
      2. language patterns have intents
        3. agents apply language patterns to achieve intent
          4. linguistic intents are often to change meaning until its false (out of the full set of intents to 'communicate info')
          5. agent often over-think how to emphasize/reduce language components and it creates unnatural language patterns
          6. agent-changed language (newly created patterns) is rarely more efficient than normal language patterns (inherited patterns)
            7. when it is more efficient, it is quickly adopted until its normal
            8. more efficient language patterns are likelier to be true, bc of the normally simpler connection patterns of facts 
          9. it takes work to make a set of falsehoods or mix of falsehoods & facts seems like a fact, and the work has side effects like lack of normality (sounding unnatural in structure) or simplicity (using fewer resources to connect components)

    - relevant concepts
      - the concept of 'simplicity' interacts with connections 1, 5, 8, & 9
      - the concept of 'normality' interacts with connections 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9

    - these concepts can be used as almost interchangeable alternatives in generating the interface query generating this insight path

    - despite their differing definitions, simplicity & normality are connected by the concept of efficiency, because what is simple often becomes normal because of the efficiency of simplicity, so efficiency can be used as an interchangeable concept of both of these in some cases

    - interface query to generate the insight path to 'derive an attribute to identify facts'
      - apply concept interface
        - identify important concepts (simplicity, efficiency, emphasis, reduction, falsehood, change, connection, pattern, normality, agency) of the problem system of 'identify facts'
        - apply relevant concepts to problem system
          - agents change language to achieve intents
            - apply intent interface by mapping to intents ('change info' for intent of lying, or 'false similarity to fact')
              - connect intents to original relevant concepts
                - connect problem system component derived from intent interface of 'agent-changed language' to concepts of normality & falsehood

  - add to definitions
    - reason as source cause node ('this happened because of this causal factor')
    - intent as target cause node ('this happened because this intent was the goal used as a cause of the agent's decisions')

  - add to causation variables
    - ability to change (if a variable cant be changed, it is less causative for problem-solving intents)

  - add to problem type structures as 'indistinguishable cause'

    - multiple causes of the same variable

      - example: gravity (no agency, just granular intent of 'apply force to relevant objects') can cause an object to fall, just like throwing it down (concept of agency and intent to 'move object down' or 'move object to ground') can cause it to fall

  - add to false similarity examples
    - set of interactions that are unrelated but appear correlated

      - examples
        - system B has an output that is structural similar to outputs of system A
          - interactions of system B that happen at a later time but their interim outputs may have a structural similarity to the outputs of system A
        - system B may cause a similar or equal output to that of system A, for a different intent/reason
          - if the output is used as a metric, they will seem similar or related

      - efficiencies are a reason (source cause node) that structural similarities occur
        - efficient structures follow patterns that may produce similar structural outputs

  - add to connect function examples
    - how to map connections between two systems
      - standardize structures (like sequential structures such as time), standardizing to either system's structures, interim structures, common structures, interface (like system or core) structures, contextual system-containing system's structures, etc
      - abstract to patterns (like type, cause, system structures)
      - conversion functions (like remove, apply, connect, define)

  - map gravity to similarity (in position) as a calculation efficiency, where calculation efficiencies (like how to minimize surface area or how to apply a key to decrypt info) are an input to information
    - gravity between bulk/boundary creating the mapping of equivalent attributes
      - gravity as:
        - the average or highest-weighted path of interacting paths
        - structure of efficiency through organization 
    - definition: 'structure of minimized surface area as a component of 'entanglement' connecting function of two boundary points'
      - reduced mapping (minimized surface area) is a calculation efficiency to determine boundary position
        - this reduced mapping could be used to connect boundary positions (or their components like an attribute)
    - entanglement as an efficiency to handle risk of information destruction or to handle over efficiency (distribute efficiency (in the form of information) across multiple points)
      - use a mapping efficiency to connect distributed info with structural similarities
    - particles lose their adjacence/similarity bias/efficiency inside the black hole
    - "highest-weighted path from point a to b is the most efficient space-time path, which is not always equal to the 'classical physics' space-time path" (find examples of intents that classical physics is not efficient for)
      - is quantum physics using a different definition of efficiency/similarity or is it using another priority (like energy storage vs. energy usage)
      - how do weighted quantum paths interact with the weighted paths of other particles
    - nonlocality/entanglement as a calculation efficiency in the form of the replica trick
    - wormholes as:
      - calculation efficiencies
      - radiation given off of calculation efficiencies, removing information or filters preventing possibilities
      - sequence of a lack of filters preventing possible paths
      - interfaces (connecting standardizing functions)
      - hidden variables/differences (masquerading as similarities)
    - 'replica trick' as:
      - a way of transferring energy stored in sequential repetition (one coin outcome repeated a number of times in a sequence structure) to energy stored in distributed equivalence (two coins having equal outcome)
    - time as:
      - energy store
        - if time exists, it means change is possible, because energy has been organized in a structure that allows change to occur, meaning structures have developed, meaning efficient structures have been found (organization of energy formats)
        - can you attract other spacetimes so theyre adjacent by storing energy in a way that is adjacent to their storage methods

  - give example of deriving formula with definitions of components 

    - problem metadata

      - problem statement (formula to derive):
        - expected value of the random variable f(x) = actual average of distribution

      - definitions of components:

        - average definition: 
          - sum of all values divided by number of values

        - expected value definition: 
          - average of all possible values, weighted by probability of each possible value
          - expectation is linear

        - p(x) probability density 'distribution sample' definition
          - independent & identically distributed values

      - solution statement:
        - independently & identically distributed samples (data points) from a distribution inside the boundary of the area to estimate, divided by the total number of data points in the distribution is a way to fulfill intent 'approximate area inside boundary'

    - definition connections

      - identify 'probability' as a useful concept to map to problem space:
        - because of structural similarity in probability structures & problem definition (proportion)
        - or as a useful method to find a representative subset to avoid trial & error (or combinationatorial) calculation of area

      - connect concepts of core components ('probability', 'average value', 'sample size', 'data points', 'area') using definitions
        - this should produce the concept of 'convergence' as sample size variable is changed & average value approaches actual area

      - definitions of concept interations
        - 'area' is a related concept to 'probability' when:
          - data points are mapped to possible outcomes
          - problem-solving intent is either:
            - general structure: estimate the proportion of a subset relative to a whole
              - specific structure: estimate the probability of a subset of possible outcomes relative to all possible outcomes

    - alternate routes to derive formula

        - apply conceptual structures

          - apply 'opposite' structure
            - probability of being in the area to estimate
            - probability of not being in the area to estimate

          - apply 'random' structure
            - reduce 'trial & error' solution structure in this problem space of 'testing all possible points' to a subset of all possible points
              - how to select a subset of points
                - extreme points
                - evenly distributed points
                - random selection of points would produce a representative sample of points in a bounded area with increasing accuracy given increasing number of points
                  - randomly distributed points are a way around trial & error of all possible points

        - generate counter-arguments (questions) as filters to reduce error types

          - question every decision, with decision defined as 'variable selections that impact future decisions (future variable selections)'

            - variables

              - method of selecting points
                
                - beginner question: 
                  - why not just generate integer or .1 points starting at origin until all possible outcomes have been covered by an even lattice of points
                - beginner answer:
                  - this introduces bias in the form of an anchored starting point & applies unnecessary meaning to the sequence of points added, which means estimates with low number of points would be biased towards the area around the origin graphable with that number of points
                  - this bias represents a structure of certainty, rather than a way of estimating probability, which by definition is uncertain
                - generate beginner question
                  - apply error type "lack of concept of 'probability'" (indicating an uncertainty like a random distribution, rather than a certainty like a constant in the form of an origin)
                - generate beginner answer
                  - generate differences in between structure posited by beginner and actual requirements
                    - meaning assigned to the origin/sequence is unnecessary and even the opposite of what is required (independent samples that are not connected to subsequence samples in the sequence)
                
                - advanced question:
                  - wouldnt this take a lot of data points to converge to the actual mean

        - apply concept of 'probability' to 2d graph problem space to solve the problem of 'estimating 2d scalar multiplication or summing of 2d scalar multiplication' 

          - probability definition route: 
            - observed x outcomes in proportion to all possible outcomes = probability of x outcome

          - applied concept of 'probability' to 2d graph problem space: 
            - subset of 2d structures (points) in proportion to total set of 2d structures (points) = bounded area

            - start from system in which problem & solution occur (given solution potential) and fit/connect systems gap structures to problem/solution structures, rather than starting from problem & navigating to solution or connecting them in the middle or working in reverse
              - 
          - connect solution components to solution
            - start from existing solution structures & apply filters or other structures to reach solution

    - change variable 'location of power':
      - spotify is welcome to build their own app store with their own phones or team up with their coalition to do so
      - add variable 'time sequence' to 'location of power' change:
        - if spotify operates an app store someday, they will set rules to benefit themselves too, just like theyve done in the past
      - offer an alternative to charging app store rate
        - is there a one-click button to migrate from spotify to apple that could replace any difference in taxes on spotify
    - apply conceptual definition filter 'does concept of persecution (and related components of the definition like focus) apply to the behavior (does behavior have a specific target that is the focus of persecution)'
      - are apple's rules applied exclusively to spotify? if not, it's not anti-competitive behavior
    - apply intent filter
      - is spotify's mission nobler than apple's
    - apply system cost-benefit analysis
      - what features were improved bc spotify exists? are those features worth anything or required needs? did they develop those features better than competitors?
      - if spotify is just charging rent on a catalog, are they adding value to the market, so they should be allowed to dictate the market at all?
      - what products/features would apple develop if they didnt have to pay a fine, and what are those features worth, and are those features required?
    - apply logical fallacy filters
      - apply 'hypocrisy' filter
        - apply 'anti-competitive' conceptual definition structures & test if these structures fit the opponent
          - does spotify plan on raising prices at some point or will they keep prices low even if the app store rate holds? are they only keeping prices low to dominate the market & plan on raising prices later? isnt that anti-competitive behavior?
          - if they are so concerned about anti-competitive behavior, why arent they trying to compete by building their own app store? isnt there a risk that the apple app store is sub-optimal and needs to be improved with competition from spotify

        - a problem of 'find approximation' can be solved with metric structures like accuracy & specificity':
          - apply filters of specificity (to make sure the problem solved is the right problem to solve, like 'find an approximation for a prediction function' rather than finding an approximation for another object)
            - apply filters of accuracy (to make sure input/output values are within a range that can be fit to the definition of accuracy in the problem space)

        - would the component be created anyway, even with a minor barrier
        - is the component incentivized in the system
        - how much work would you have to do to prevent the component from being generated in the system (it would be created unconditionally, or in what percent of conditions)
        - does that work change the system to an extreme degree (changing its identity/type/intent)

      - find connection structures associated with interfaces (direction structure associated with intent):
        - causal direction is directly defined to be relevant in the 'connection' definition, which implies an input/output connection, inputs being liked to 'dependency', which is linked to 'cause'

# content/config

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths (info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight', system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub')
    - define default & core objects necessary for system to function (out of the box, rather than minimal config necessary to derive other system components & assemble)
      - add default functions to solve common problem types
      - alternate utility function implementations have variation potential in the exact operations used to achieve the function intents, but there are requirements in which definitions these functions use because they are inherent to the system. For example, the embodiment may use a specific definition of an attribute (standardized to a set of filters) in order to build the attribute-identification function using a set of filters - but the general attribute definition is still partially determined in its initial version by requirements specified in the documentation, such as a set of core attribute types (input, output, function parameter, abstract, descriptive, identifying, differentiating, variable, constant), the definition of a function, and the definition of conversion functions between standard formats.
