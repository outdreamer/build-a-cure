        - drinkme/examples_from_faq.md
          - check other examples of high-value use cases (other than identifying important concepts) from faq:
            - identifying the important base to frame changes on (identifying new interfaces)

        - specific examples from specific_problem_analysis
          - example of permuting assumption: "reports of power consumption have to be exact measurements" 
            - a temperature monitor sensitive to a hundredth of a degree might provide similar but non-specific power reporting for important/extreme usage patterns without revealing such specific information as that which could infer exact operations being done, bc the interval of temperature measurements allows for greater variation in calculations that could explain it
          - example of using set theory in query operations:

          - example of structural version of solution difference from original solution: 
              - this is like using a pair of connected lines at different angles to connect two points (multiplying alternate multiplier pairs to create a product), where summing the line lengths produces an equivalence, so different solutions would look like differently angled triangles connecting the two points

              - also an example of a solution space (the whole function is the solution space of possible minima/maxima) and a filter applied to it (constraint)


## examples

  - why problems will always have new variables determining how solution automation workflows can be generated
    - problems are a 'lack of available structures that can fix the problematic structures', requiring new structures to be found, built, or derived to solve those problems
    - by definition, problems will always change from previous problems
    - therefore problems are a structural source of new change types
    - new change types map to new variables describing those change types
    - new variables may not be adjacently buildable, derivable, or findable with existing structures, leading to a requirement to find/build/derive new structures to structure those new problem variables
    - this may lead to new values of existing variables like new problem-solving intents or new problem/solution core interaction functions, or other new structures that may be representable as new variables, bc they exist on another interface where problems & solutions interact, such as new variables regarding a new function type that can be used for problem/solution interactions
    - even if a problem is static, there will always be new ways to solve it because of the inherent variation captured in the concept of 'problem', and these solution-finding methods will always have new interfaces or other structures which can be used to frame them

  - add to science
    - metformin and a low carb diet reduces serum vitamin b which can be used as inputs to cancerous growth
    - check how folding relates to growth patterns like exponential growth, learning & information storage, and related structures like waves
    - prioritize 'scouting nanobots' to clean out chemicals as a prevention measure

  - add to definitions
    - solution-finding method can mean a solution-finding method on any interaction level, such as a domain-specific problem space (like how 'regression' is a solution-finding method in the 'find a prediction function' problem space), or a problem-solution interaction level (like how a solution automation workflow or interface query is a solution-finding method), or interim interaction levels (like how a 'find connecting input/output sequence' is a solution-finding method on the function interface)
      - if the problem is (or can be) to 'find a solution-finding method', these will also be called 'solutions' to that problem

  - add to useful structures
      - functions whose outputs can be their inputs, like iteratable functions, where the inputs/outputs are relevant to or are useful structures
        - where problem-solving structures or methods can be iterated, apply them iteratively where complexity isnt reduced by prior iterations
          - 'find solution-finding methods of solution-finding methods of solution-finding methods'
          - 'find structures in structures in structures'
          - 'approximate apaproximations of approximations'
          - 'predict prediction function of prediction function inputs'
          - 'alternate alternatives of alternatives'
      - apply sources of ambiguity as possible interfaces and variables
        - if an ambiguity is maintained, the measurement/metrics of the ambiguous alternatives are wrong, or the assumption that they were similar alternatives is wrong, or the assumption that a selection should be made is wrong, or the assumption that either is correct (as opposed to neither) is wrong, or the question being asked about their similarities/differences in metrics is wrong, or the optimal alternative is a combination of alternatives or different option from either alternative, or its a structure of randomness or equivalence, or change types are involved which are not measurable or which dont have a measurable impact in that system/interface, or it can support enough change types of a unique conceptual foundation that it qualifies as an interface
        - if it doesnt resolve, it can be a set of interchangeables forming an interaction layer, which can act as an interface, like how 'variables' & 'state' are both structures of change that would seem like ambiguous alternatives under the wrong measurements

  - add to solution automation workflows

    - identify opposite structures like 'gaps' of useful problem/solution structures like 'variable handling coverage' created by available structures of the problem & known solutions, structures such as filters, where available filters represent what can be or is measured, so anything not covered by them is a source of possible error structures, as a way of identifying/finding/deriving new error structures, fulfilling the problem-solving intent of 'avoid errors'
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem, filters include requirements and assumptions built-in to the solution-finding method such as the definition of the concept of average that is used, or the method applied to tune the function such as generalization, smoothing, simplifying, regularizing, normalizing, standardizing, or curving methods, and given these filters, other change types may not be applied to the function, such as an outlier not handled by the function that is nevertheless valid, or a break in continuity that is valid, because the assumptions inherent to applying a 'smoothing' or 'generalizing' method will ignore these points in the data set and prioritize creating a continuous function to represent or connect certain subsets of the data set, so the 'gap' in the available filters including a particular definition or a solution-finding method contains the alternate structures not creatable with that definition or method, as a discrete point such as a valid outlier is not creatable with a method that produces a continuous function that 'represents' the data set, unless it coincidentally intersects with that structure, which is relying on randomness rather than a reliable method of preventing those errors
      - the 'variable handling coverage' refers to structures that can be built/derived/found with a set of structures in the problem space or known solution set
      - 'variable handling coverage' is a useful structure in determining what is adjacently & non-adjacently possible with a set of structures, such as a set of known solutions
      - 'variable handling coverage' could also be applied to problems, in finding gaps between problem structures given variables of problems in that problem space, which are possible solutions

    - identify interface structures such as the change types required to find/derive/generate a useful structure for a particular problem format given its definition and apply those change types to find useful structures for a particular problem
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem, useful structures include the function's parameters, its determining points & requirements, and generative functions of the function
        - to convert 'find a prediction function' into these useful structures, various change types are applied which can be applied in other problems to find useful structures
          - changing its format to include other components (exponent terms), converting it to a set of 'constants' applied to these standardized exponent terms
          - changing its format into its 'determining points & requirements'
          - changing the causal position by identifying 'generative functions'
      - workflow fit: an alternative to the 'apply known useful structures for a particular problem after standardizing to that problem'

    - derive interface queries of known solutions and identify other interface queries that could be applied to generate other solutions, where known solutions are inefficient, impractical, or sub-optimal in another way
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem, the following interface queries can generate existing solutions
        - the 'parameter matrix' is generated by an interface query to 'find "structure" that can store "output" of applying "multiple" structure to "generative parameters" of the "function"'
        - the 'regression' solution is generated by an interface query to 'find "required" structures given the problem definition such as "representative line"' (leading to the concept of the 'average' as an input to a 'representation' structure)
        - 'find "subset" prediction functions and apply a "average" definition to them'
        - 'find "adjacence" structures (like adjacent y-values) and apply adjacent change structures found'

    - once useful structures are found/derived/generated/applied for a particular problem, apply other useful structures like change structures that are likely to create differences that could make useful structures like patterns in problem structures like values more obvious
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem, a useful value structure would be a matrix of alternate parameters of the function if one exists (if there are parameter sets with equal number of parameters across different generative function types), so that other changes could be applied to this structure, to create other value structures to examine for connections (such as representing this matrix as a grid of scalar vectors mapping to each value in the parameter matrix)

    - find possible errors in the problem statement such as assumptions that could change the other problem/solution structures, such as solution formats
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem:
        - find different parameterized lines (such as lines converted into a set of segments with different formatting, where the parameters have relevance structures like complimentary variance handling or an overlap structure across different parameter sets) that can generate the line
        - find parameters of a matrix representing different parameter sets of a function (descriptive parameters, compression parameters, generative neural network parameters, wave function parameters, regression parameters, etc) & how they relate to actual function parameters (coefficients, powers)
        - or find a function for an area/shape rather than a line to represent different possible averages and probabilities that each average definition or type should be used as the output's predictor where the area indicates probability of an output occurring between the various lines
        - or find a function that emphasizes/prioritizes data points likely to be near to the actual prediction function or standardizes points in a way that makes them closer to the actual prediction function or removes points that are not closer, to give a shape of an implied function by a data set with a more obvious pattern
        - all of which have a different solution output format that is a variable when the assumption that the output should be a line and nothing else is removed, or that one definition of a component should be used
      - workflow fit: this is similar to other workflows that change the source/destination but applies error structures to find possible variables to apply to problem/solution structures like the solution output format

    - find a space where the prediction function's parameters will be more clearly identifiable (such as by extreme values like minima, or by converging values, or by values that signal a change in change types like inflection points or changes in change rate), like how adding a dimension to a 2-d prediction function might allow identifying a minimum point in the 3-d space where the change types stabilize, which reveals where the peaks & other features of the function are located, so that the task becomes finding the original feature-differentiating minima or other structures in the 3-d space

    - identify connections to generate different solution formats and how to find the format most adjacent and useful for a particular problem
      - example: with the 'find a prediction function' problem, the prediction function can take multiple formats - a set of function parameters like coefficients, a set of interactions with other structures of different dimensions like the pattern of a straight line's intersecting points with a curved function, a set of change rates/types in a structure like a sequence, a set of neural network parameters that could find the prediction function parameters, an infinite sequence, a set of minimal points that could derive the rest of the function (like how a parabola can be derived from 3 - 5 points depending on their positions & other requirements like positive values, where these points can be found with 'subset function' averages & other representations, or in finding the core structures like angles or change types like fast/slow curved/linear change of the function and determining points that determine those core structures), and some of these formats are more amenable to being used with particular solution-finding methods

    - identify multiple solution-finding methods and apply components of one to the other in a way that is likely to be useful
      - example: applying the method used to 'generate different variants' of the function coefficients in neural networks is likely to be useful in an altered method of regression, which doesnt inherently find alternate variants of a function and merge them in a weighting method, bc regression uses the concept of the 'average' already and incorporating another version of the concept of 'average' is likely to be useful

    - find/derive/generate solutions having specific error structures (such as an incorrect assumption that the 'average of a data set is the correct average but is incorrect') as a way to quickly identify what is not the solution by applying these incorrect solutions as an initial non-solution space to use as a filter to find the correct solution
      - workflow fit: this is similar to finding the set of 'maximally different' solutions as an initial solution space to filter, with the exception that known error types are injected in these initial solutions, which are likelier to be not solutions but by definition non-solutions that have a known probable error, as a way to determine the actual solution by its difference from these known error non-solutions

    - apply useful structures like system layer graphs as a general structure that is useful for problem-solving, integrating new problem & information learned from them into the same structure, adding as few structures as possible in the form of new objects, connections, and levels, which are default structures with which most other structures can be framed, similar to a network graph
      - new structures like problems/systems may take new structures to accurately represent on a graph like the system layer graph, and while that is being identified, vacillating between an 'exploratory' state (to consider the possibility of new structures encountered in a problem/system) and a 'learning fitting' state (to integrate new learned info into the system), the system layer graph has an 'uncertainty structure' to capture the extra possible complexity (in the form of an interface structure network or system layer graph, containing more useful interface structures nearer to the origin)
      - derive useful structures by which structures reduce the most variation (as in 'capture the most complexity')
        - other useful structures for problem solving would include networks/trees, interfaces (and more specific input-output sequences & core components) as different structures to standardize representations of information in a way that is likely to be useful for problem-solving in general

    - identify which structures would enable finding relevant structures for a particular problem
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem, this would take the form of 'predicting other variables from various sets of other variables in the variable set', because 'causal dependencies' are a particularly relevant structure for this problem format, and applying 'change' to the important structures of the problem space like 'variable' structures using various change types generated by interface analysis will help in identifying these relevant structures for solving the problem ('causal dependencies')
        - apply interface analysis to determine probabilities of dependence structures
          - apply the 'subset' structure to the 'variable set' structure
            - can one variable predict multiple other variables
            - which variables are necessary to predict the others
            - which variables can be removed without high impact on most of these subset predictions
          - apply the 'change position' structure to the 'variable positions' determined by 'variable type' 
            - can the dependent variable adjacently determine an independent variable
            - is one of the independent variables a possible output variable (multiple output variables)
          - apply the 'change position' and 'subset' structure changes
            - can the dependent variable adjacently determine a subset of independent variables
          - apply the 'sequence' structure
            - can the variables be framed in a sequence structure, where one set determines an interim set that determines an output set
          - apply filters of possible variable interactions based on:
            - probability: 
              - how many operations are necessary to convert one variable set into another, given that fewer operations implies a structure of truth in an optimized system
              - do variable interactions align on multiple interfaces
              - are variable interactions probable given patterns of other variable interactions
              - are variable interactions possible given known limits, requirements, and rules

    - apply solutions to a more complex problem than the problem like how predicting a value in an infinite sequence (or determining differences between infinite sequences or their functions) is more complex than predicting a dependent variable value in a polynomial function, so filtering a set of many (possibly infinitely many) different prediction functions can be solved with methods from a related but more complex problem

    - identify information that is an output of a solution that can be used to derive/find/generate the solution, rather than identifying info about the solution or solution inputs, to use as a different target when solving a problem
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem, this would take the form of identifying solution output metrics such as proxy metrics to a prediction function (including area under curve, number of peaks, probability distribution of local averages, etc) that can be used to identify/determine/approximate the prediction function, and change the problem to predicting those function metrics instead of function parameters like constants/multipliers/exponents applied to variables

    - apply interface structures to problem space to determine other problem structures than those directly relevant to the original problem that can be used to infer solutions to the original problem
      - example: 
        - in the 'find a prediction function' problem, apply interface structures such as 'alternates' and 'adjacence' to problem space structures such as 'input variables', to infer adjacent variables of a data set, such as direct inputs & outputs of the original inputs, to find a set of connecting variables that can be further connected to the original outputs to predict, or to find out if the original inputs can be corrected in some way given these adjacent variables, or if adjacent variables to the original inputs can more easily be used to predict original outputs
        - another example is how 'cause' is a directly relevant structure to the 'find a prediction function' problem, which attempts to identify variable dependencies, dependencies being a causal structure
      - an alternate general variant of this would be to apply interface structures to identify structures like 'alternate' applied to general problem/solution structures, like 'alternate' function types (such as finding an alternate general function than find/derive/apply/generate) 

    - apply interface structures to determine what structures could produce a useful structure for solving a problem in a particular problem format (such as how a 'variable relationship' is useful for solving a problem formatted as a 'find a prediction function' problem) and whether those structures have structures of truth (such as whether they are interactive, exist, or are probable), after standardizing the original problem to a problem format (such as 'find a prediction function' problem) where such a problem structure (such as a 'variable relationship') could be used as a target to generate with interface structures
      - example: in the 'find a prediction function' problem, identify which structures could produce a 'exponential to integer or boolean' variable relationship, including such information as what degree of structures applied could connect the variable structures, and identify whether these structures are possible in a standard or specific system given how structures interact, such as a 'continuous input variable' being used as an 'activation signal' or 'type variable' in a standard system
      - another example is whether these structures can be connected using other interface structure connections, like whether the intent sequence of a structure sequence is possible/probable, thereby indicating with multi-interface alignment that the structural sequence is likelier to be true

    - identify & fulfill other problem-solving intents such as 'solve for relevant structures to solving the original problem' instead of 'solving the original problem'
      - standard problem formats (such as 'find a prediction function' or 'sort a sequence') where all problems can be solved with known methods once formatted to these standard problem formats are generally found with standard interface structures, such as how the 'prediction function' involves a standard function interface structure of a 'variable relationship' and how the 'sort a sequence' problem format involves a standard structural interface structure of a 'sequence', where these structures are 'relevant structures' to solving these problems
      - 'solving for relevant structures to solving a problem' is another problem-solving intent
      - other problem-solving intents can be identified by variables of problem-solving intents, such as which problem/solution structures & functions are involved, which interface structures are applied or fulfilled in the problem/solution structure interactions such as an input/output sequence between problem/solution structures that applies across various problem-solving intents, which problem/solution structures & formats are required by a problem-solving intent (such as a 'set of solutions'), and the degree to which & method in which the problem is solved by that intent

    - apply interface structures like concepts to a problem system and find useful structures like interaction structures of those applied interface structures as a way of finding structures that can be used to determine probability of solution success to apply as a filter of solutions
      - example: in the 'find a prediction function' problem, apply concept interface to find concepts like 'average', 'correlation' and 'causation', and apply useful structures to these applied interface structures to find structures of possible relevance as a solution filter like 'functions of data subsets that could represent correlations' and 'correlation functions that when averaged could produce the prediction function' and 'functions that would indicate causation vs. functions that would indicate correlation and filters of these function types', that can be used as 'prediction function' solution filters, given the possible meaning of these structures

    - apply structures of absolute certainty (like variables that can absolutely vary in all cases and requirements such as required variable limits or interactions) to use as starting point to reach structures of approximate or probable certainties
      - example: 
        - in the 'find a prediction function' problem, absolute certainties include 'some points may be due to randomness', 'some points may indicate change in the underlying variable interaction', etc, which indicate the absolute truth of a variable of the data set (randomness, change in interaction function) that may vary
      - from these absolute truths, approximate/probable truths connecting absolute truths that are otherwise unconnectible with absolute truths can be identified as more probable than other approximate/probable truths, having filtered out 'impossible truths' and 'improbable truths' implied or required by the 'absolute truths'

    - apply solutions that are known to be exactly incorrect/sub-optimal as a way of finding/deriving/generating errors to generate useful information to find correct/optimal solutions
      - example: if you applied a regression algorithm to a classification problem, you would identify a difference in the output regarding data type, alerting you to the fact that the data type is where the error is and is related to or is the component of the solution that needs to be changed

    - apply other useful structures than 'connections', 'sequences', or 'interactive components' applied to components of problem/solutions in fulfilling problem-solving intent functions, problem/solution core interaction functions, or other functions related to problem/solutions
      - example: rather than finding 'input-output sequences' to connect problem/solution formats/states or components available in the problem space, or finding 'interactive components' that can be chained together (starting from the 'core component' structure), apply other core structures to fulfill core interaction functions between problem/solution
        - finding structures that are by definition related to the 'connect' function, such as 'input-output sequences', are a useful structure by default in fulfilling/implementing that function, but other structures like 'sets' or 'combinations' can be usedul as well, indicating objects that are frequently or by definition found together, indicating an 'implicit' connection by adjacence/approximation rather than 'explicit' connection by match/equivalence in definition

    - apply useful structures (such as 'mix') to connect various solutions or solution-finding methods in a solution space, to useful structures (like 'components') to generate new solutions or solution-finding methods
      - example: for a problem with multiple generated/derived/found solutions or solution-finding methods like 'find a prediction function', apply the combination useful structure 'mix components' to switch various components of the solutions or solution-finding methods with alternate variants
        - for the 'find a prediction function' problem, this could take the form of switching error calculation methods or solution metrics
      - workflow fit: this is similar to the workflow of 'generating different solutions' or 'identifying variables of different solutions & generating solution variants with these variables', but is another way of achieving similar or equal intents using structures of useful structures

    - generating example solution-finding methods of varying specificity & results by applying various alternate solution automation workflows, then abstracting & parameterizing differences between examples and imputing missing differences that could generate new solution-finding methods without changing output of known examples
      - example: 
        - the difference between 'regression methods' lies in the 'error calculation metric & associated function'
        - the difference between 'regression' & 'finding prediction functions of subsets & merging their outputs by some weight assignment function' includes differences in the different percent of data input to each function, the difference in outputs of subset prediction functions, the difference-resolution/merging method of subset functions
        - these differences can be added as abstract variables like 'alternate input-output routes' & 'alternate inputs/outputs' or as specific variables like 'alternate data subset routes' & 'alternate data subsets'
        - these differences can be increased through combination with other interface structures than 'abstraction'
        - these identified variables can be used to calculate other methods not already identified in the variable interaction space
      - workflow fit: this workflow is similar to other workflows that apply 'alternate routes' to structures to find/derive/build a solution, with a specific focus on 'solution-finding methods' which can function as 'standalone interface queries' if they fit into a workflow that uses a 'standardization' step so standard solution-finding methods can be applied, or if the solution-finding methods are found/derived/generated in a specific problem space, so theyre already in a format that is relevant to the original problem

    - convert solutions from another format for an adjacent solution-finding method into a useful format for the original problem when applying another solution-finding method
      - example: for the 'find a prediction function' problem, apply solutions associated with 'classification' to solution-finding methods like 'regression'
        - meaning, for a given subset of the data set, use 'classification' to predict a value out of several discrete possible values, as calculated by various different averages of that subset of the data set, rather than finding the prediction function using standard regression methods for the entire data set
      - workflow fit: this is applying 'alternate routes' useful structure to the 'solution-finding method' solution structure, rather than the normal position of applying it to the 'problem/solution connecting functions' to find 'alternate problem/solution connecting functions'
      - interface query: the interface query for this workflow involves 'finding 'approximation structures' or 'generative structures' or 'prediction structures' of solutions' ('solution-finding methods'), rather than 'finding solutions', where the 'alternate' structure is applied to 'type' of 'solution-finding method' as well alternating the 'solution-finding method of solution-finding methods' (like 'a method to find regression-calculation functions') from the standard 'solution-finding method' (like a 'specific regression function to find the prediction function')
      - generalization: in general this method finds/derives/generates variables of the problem space (like 'alternate routes between inputs/outputs' such as: 'method of finding y from x' or 'method of finding all ys from all xs' or 'method of finding a subset of ys from a subset of xs' or 'method of finding ys from adjacent ys' and injects relevant useful structures (like how 'alternates' are useful for 'variables', as they both have a common structure of 'change')

  - add to science
    - 'sets of n particles' that act in aligned ways like:
      - 'components of a temporary local field/lattice having n points'
      - 'a connection created from equivalence structures' based on:
        - a 'homotopy equivalence between points'
        - a 'set of rotations/arrangements transforming points into a set of equivalent duplicates by definition-compliance, like the infinite cloning paradox solution'

      - how to 'create dependency' of cancer cells on a particular process/structure so when removed it can create cell death
      - drugs that response to 'high quantities of a signal' leave room for an error of 'missing low quantities' - an error where the signal is assigned a boolean and should be a continuous spectrum with a threshold that can re-create the original problem
      - how to target useful cells with growth-enhancing mechanisms like extra-chromosomal dna
      - are there genetic sequences that can offer protection against extra-chromosomal dna interactions temporarily while cancer cells are being targeted (like if a protective sequence is spaced at intervals that disincentivize interactions with extra-chromosomal dna, such as when extra-chromosomal dna merges with a chromosome)
      - how to account for probability of a known possible error (like mutations compared against a mutated rather than healthy reference genome) and adjust data accordingly
      - if a structure continues to develop, that means it represents a 'stability point' that is incentivized - which incentives of extra-chromosomal can be altered without harming other systems?
      - if a package of growth/maximizing genes continues to develop bc of 'survival bias' (the genes that are useful for survival are protected & maintained & replicated), can incentives for dna repair/defense genes be created/increased to compete with these cancerous extra-chromosomal gene structures - why is the 'survival bias' of cancerous cells & cancerous mutations stronger than other cells/genes/mutations' bias - just bc theyre more useful for cancerous intents like 'unrestricted growth' or bc of some other cause like 'genetic adjacence' or 'genetic functionality like jumping/coordination', or bc of the fact that growth factors promote themselves by the definition of their own functionality, or bc these gene/mutation types like enhancement/growth have aligning intents like 'promotion' so theyre often found together?
      - can antibodies against high-growth/maximizing extra-chromosomal gene structures be developed or can vaccines be developed to produce antibodies against them?
        - https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/oncology/curious-DNA-circles-make-treating/98/i40

  - add to automation tech
    - more devs converting to 'task description writers' creating standardized task descriptions & identifying repeated work, automation opportunities & other high-level semantic tasks is a better career once programming turns into a 'task bidding freelance market' where AI coders frequently outcompete devs
    - organized & structured code by 'core component' (function input/output variables, input/output differences, patterns, core function-calling function (high-level functions, so building core functions is the source of changes in functionality of high-level functions), uses, logical derivation connections (equivalence, requirements, dependencies) as logic trees, logically directed graphs, changes/states, function, reference, relative position of thread/process/function, limits/requirements, dependencies, data, prior operations (cache), differentiating attributes, context, mix/iteration/cycles/sequence, type, example, value)
    - 'infinite compression' as a combination of infinite sequences & numerical references to those sequences as parameters (similar to rainbow tables), where infinite random sequence subsets can be recursively compressed into hashes, where infinite sequences can be represented as a sum of sequences (infinite random adjacent base sequence + an infinite geometric sequence to generate it), or a sequence & a set of vectors indicating changes to generate the sequence from an infinite random adjacent base sequence

  - additional attributes (metadata) of interfaces include attributes like validity & relevance, which vary absolutely across other interfaces, and contextually across interface queries/solution automation workflows & problems being solved with them

  - additional examples of error causes
      - example of priorities leading to errors:
        - the 'selfish' perspective prioritizes simple, structural objects (like thos within an adjacent range), which is why 'selfish' programs can only see & act on those things rather than producing solutions that can be used for many problems, even ones they dont have
      - example of how a 'lack of errors' in a closed system can produce an error in system-level interactions, like a cross-system merge

  - add to stats
    - give example of visualizing the stats object connections in a stat insight rule
      - add example of how to derive the rule 'choose algorithm with low bias/high variance for large data sets'
        - use 'random forest' bagging method to reduce high variance
        - high variance is a problem when a sample data set is not representative of the population, producing accuracy for the training data subsets & errors for all other data subsets
          - if a data set is relatively large in relation to the population, the 'sample data set is not representative of the population' is less likely to be a relevant problem
          - 'variance can only be reduced by averaging over multiple observations, which inherently means using information from a larger region'
        - high bias is a problem when sample data sets differ from the population mean by a lot, producing errors for most samples unless they happen to be represented by the general model
          - if a data set is relatively large in relation to the population, the 'sample data sets differ from the population mean' is less likely to be a relevant problem, so the large data set can be used as a basis for the general model
          - 'bias is reduced using local information'
          - 'If training set is small, high bias / low variance models (e.g. Naive Bayes) tend to perform better because they are less likely to be overfit.'
          - 'If training set is large, low bias / high variance models (e.g. Logistic Regression) tend to perform better because they can reflect more complex relationships.'

  - give examples of why other tech solutions are insufficient
    - why ml would be inaccurate on math problems (like 'predict convergence value for an infinite series, based on training data of infinite series param input & convergence value output')
      - regularization, bias/noise changes, and other feature changes for intents like 'generalization' or 'feature selection' may add to inaccuracies
      - the structures that can be composed by various function/node/weight/threshold unit combinations may not be capable of the math operations involved in transforming one value/format into another
      - the math problem has emergent structures that are not visible in the training data set, for example a point where the relationship function between the inputs/outputs changes (like an asymptote or a maximum)
      - the training data may reflect patterns that are simpler for the network to compose/filter/reduce, without enough data points representing more complexity (a parabola instead of a hyperbolic function)
        - the network may be good at providing filter/compose/reduce functionality, but not other functionality like 'converge' or 'select between similar alternatives'
        - the support for 'multiple alternative input-output routes' in networks may add too much complexity in reducing its ability to specify a particular answer, with built-in tools to find averages or other representative values rather than selecting one value over another
        - for some functions, there are too many inputs that could produce the labeled output, and those inputs may be too similar to differentiate/specify (very similar functions can produce the same area)
      - neural networks are primarily good at certain data transformations, like where the problem input can be converted into the solution output by a system of linear equations or matrix operations supported by the network, where coefficients/weights of versions of function components (inputs & interim weighted combinations of inputs) are the required output of the network, and those operations may not adjacently handle operations like summing an infinite series, which might require specialized structures like memory/state-embedding or online learning if those structures cant be produced by adding additional layers to a network
      - each feature of the infinite series input would contribute to the output, but a neural network is designed to learn weights of features, implying that some are less important, and the contribution of terms in a series to the convergence value can usually be determined by its size/position
      - if parameters of the series are used instead of the series, that is a low feature space compared to the input features available in other applications of neural networks
      - the operations in some formulas do not produce reliable learnable patterns (some structures of randomness would counteract the ability of the network to learn a function)
      - the inputs dont provide enough data for continuously differentiable spaces where methods like gradient descent can be applied, given that math functions often cover a wide range of possible inputs, and a training data set is unlikely to be representative of enough examples to fill in the gaps in this space

    - VAR & reservoir computing's random sample of matrixes is inadequate bc the randomness is an attempt to identify 'very different' difference types, without generalizing that into a unique set of differences that are likely to be useful (like differences distributed across pairs of variables, so many random samples dont represent difference types in the same pair)
    - regression is insufficient even if its a good temporary solution if you dont have other resources than the data set, bc its conclusion/outputs (in the form of the regression function) can have the opposite meaning 'random noise' as the intended meaning 'causal relationships'
    - statistics in general is built on the insight that 'probability is associated with certainty/truth', but it ignores other certainty structures like structures that are more useful than patterns/probability, such as definitions, concepts, meaning/understanding/integration/organization, cause, inevitability/requirement, determination/generation/description structures, functions of varying interaction levels, etc
    - machine-learning can have the opposite functionality given extreme data values or update functionality manipulation (to train it to give the wrong answer in its online learning functionality), as well as other exploits from interactions of the algorithm, network, parameters, emergent structures, & data, and it is not built on understanding
      - 'one-degree connection structures' which are present in 'foundation models' are incapable of capturing multi-degree connection structures like sequences/chains or structures of connections like trees/networks/groups, even though other structures can be formatted as core structures like 'connections', it doesnt mean a one-degree connection network will capture them, or that a network of connections is the most optimal structure for that info given its usage
      - machine-learning based on neuroscience leaves out other brain interfaces like psychology, chemistry, & language
        - a psychologist might interpret a thought as 'an emotional reaction to a chemical stimulus that retrieved a memory'
        - a neuroscientist might interpret a thought as 'a response to electrical stimulus given weighted connections between neurons that previously handled that stimulus'
        - a linguist might interpret a thought as 'a deviation from a previous phrase that captured an experience to handle a change to that experience'
        - a chemist might interpret a thought as 'a result of scaled electron dynamics in response to a chemical'
        - a biologist might interpret a thought as 'a useful way to produce serotonin to offset a signal from the gut'

    - add example of impact of methods on various network types given the differences in method/network structures & include assumptions

    - derive logic types that would be necessary to complete the logic interface & give examples of logical object interactions

    - a 'find a solution' function should be able to be converted into a 'generate a solution' function & other functions like 'test a solution' & 'apply a solution', bc as the brain learns, it can generate solutions on demand once understanding develops

    - give example of identifying meaning of emergent structures (like 'weight trees' in neural networks)

    - organize workflows using useful structures as being on the meaning interface, where useful structures from other interfaces overlap & connect with the meaning interface

    - write interface queries to generate each workflow

    - give examples of how each workflow can be applied to various standard problems (find a prediction function, sorting problem, ml configuration/algorithm-design problem), which can be used as a data source to derive implementation logic/interface queries to generate solutions

    - finish math mapping so you can find other useful/solution structures (interaction space as convolution, core functions as basis vectors, etc)

    - basic solution automation workflows
      - trial & error
        - use a rules/solution database & look up the answer (try known solutions)
        - apply machine-learning with various configurations (try known/probable configurations)

      - break problem into sub-problems & merge sub-solutions

    - example of format/intent matching
      - formatting a 'tree' as a 'set of overlapping sequences with overlaps in either inputs or outputs' so functions can be formatted for different intents like in 'parallel processing'

    - add to input structures
      - input variable/trigger/requirement/component

    - add to output structures
      - limits on what a structure can be used to create
      - similarities/differences to inputs (inputs change can be preserved in outputs)

    - identify new interactions/structures
      - trying structures of structures that havent been tried yet (like how new words evolve as a 'combination' of other words to describe new experiences that are similar to both combined words)

    - 'testing/simulation' involves querying for related rules (like how 'gravity' rules are related to 'motion' rules so any change involving motion should have a 'gravity rule check' applied as a filter) & checking if they apply to relevant components (like how specific components are involved in 'motion', like 'energy', 'motion restrictions', 'motion functions', 'motion triggers/inputs/components')
      - this is an important process for checking if a structure is valid/consistent in a system, which is a useful function
      - this is different from basic testing, which is where a function is applied and the output is checked against an expected value, bc it involves testing for validity/consistency in a system context where the change is being applied

    - examine interaction space of tech stack layers (ml models, algorithms, data, apps, bugs, os, chips) as a source of new errors
      - example: 
        - ai applied to design chips
        - chips with data erasure bugs that exacerbate os data erasure bugs
        - chip designs that produce error types for various ai models/algorithms/parameters
        - how 'gpus are known to be better at building ai models'

  - add to error-finding methods
    - identifying & generating known useful structures like 'symmetries', 'variables', 'subsets', 'interchangeable alternatives', 'maximally different inputs' & 'bases' & 'type/phase shift thresholds'
      - identifying & generating combination structures of useful structures like 'maximally different values around bases'
    - identifying gaps in known useful structures explaining data points (where data points arent explained by those known structures) & generating inputs in those gaps other than those data points

  - add to conceptual math
    - example of a conceptual math operation that builds a boundary structure leaving an inevitability of a matching concept (numbers) filling the structure
      - the concepts of 'missing', 'multiple/more', 'unit', 'type', 'identifiable as similar/equal/different' and 'difference in amount' allow for/require/build the concept of 'numbers'
      - also functions like 'compare' or 'reduce' or 'expand' require the concept of 'numbers' when comparing objects of that data type or objects having a quantifiable attribute

  - add to causation variables
    - ability to change (if a variable cant be changed, it is less causative for problem-solving intents)

  - add to info problems
    - this manipulates:
      - audience objects:
        - ego
        - assumptions (about patterns, what you would notice/figure out)
        - attention
        - feelings 'opposite' to logic (safety, confusion)
      - using objects like distractions, activations, distortions, core structures like combinations/sequences, complexity, patterns, input/output similarities/alternatives (complex/simple implementations), logic, patterns of logic, logic avoidance, jokes
      - to produce:
        - errors in expectations (in order for the audience to expect y, they have to have assumption x, as x is an input to y)
      - these important variables can be identified by identifying the inputs to these objects
        - what 'input' is 'required' for this expectation error to happen? (an assumption)
      - https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/teller-reveals-his-secrets-100744801/?all&no-ist

  - when is it optimal to store a mixed structure of varying specificity (like a type, intent, cause & a specific example)
      - when there are potential uncertainties to resolve, like whether the example represents a new error, type, or variable, bc the example doesnt fit known structures

  - all primary interfaces can act like the problem-solving interface (start solving problem from the concept or structure interface and integrate all info back into that interface & frame the solution in terms of that interface) but the meaning interface (the interface interface) is the most powerful

  - apply concepts to structures

    - concept of attention in structures
      - mixed interim high-variation & high-similarity structures tend to maximize attention
    - examine error type of conflating intent & requirement
    - consciousness as choice to move between neural nodes (rather than being directed) required:
      - the development of alternative node paths performing equal/similar functions, requiring:
        - the development of excess resources, delaying required decision time (making immediate decision unnecessary, avoiding a forced decision), requiring:
          - the existence & application of previous efficiencies & functions for alternative evaluation, energy storage, storage-checking, & energy requirement-identifying
      - the cause could be framed as structures such as an 'efficiency stack' or 'energy maintenance functions' or 'alternative options' or 'navigation/motion control' or 'lack of requirement/need'
    - examine similarity (alignment/overlap) structures between: 
      - extremely different components (when an error type is an incentive or a function used for other intents) 
        - when the solution format of some problem has similarities to the error type, like when you need randomness so errors generating randomness are a possible function to use for that intent
        - contradictory/opposite components (have some metric in common, with opposite values)
    - examine the distortion vector paths that adjacently decompose a data set into a prediction function from a base point/function set

  - add examples of:
    - mapping to structures & identifying contradictions its safe to ignore for applying a structure
    - system/object/rule/type change patterns
    - query examples for use cases like:
      - lack of information stored (match problem of type 'information lack' with interface query 'check pattern interface for similar patterns')
      - query problem breakdown & integration diagram
      - calculating various different problem breakdown strategies first before executing normal query-building logic for each
    - example of how to predict most interactive/causal concepts in a system

    - chart type: overlaying multiple 2-dimension variable comparisons to identify common shapes of variable connections (density of points added with a visible attribute like more opacity)
    - structures of emergence
      - example: 1-1 input/output relationship up an interaction layer, where extra resources that dont dissolve immediately on the higher interaction layer aggregate & form core structures like combinations, where interactions between combinations & sequences have different dynamics than the individual output interacting with other individual outputs
    - how emergent functionality/attributes come from interaction structures (sequences & layers)
    - intent-matching
    - interface overflow (to sub-interfaces), interface foundation
    - workflow
      - function to identify relevance filter ('functions', 'required') from a problem_step ('find incentives') for a problem definition, to modify problem_steps with extra functions/attributes ('change_position') to be more specific to the problem definition ('find_incentives_to_change_position') for problem_steps involving 'incentives', so you know to use the function_name to modify the problem step if it's between the type 'functions' and the object searched for 'incentives'
    - conceptual math interface query
      - use lattice multiplication as standard example, other than core operations (add/multiply mapped to language, concepts like irreversibility/asymmetry mapped to math)
    - interface conversion, matching, starting point selection (applying structure, checking if relevant information is found)
    - sub-functions of core functions with distortions (identify/filter of find)
    - dimension links higher than 3d that are depictable in the same network space
      - should show variables that impact other variables, the change rates of these relationships
      - overall impact should be calculatable from these relationships
      - should show similar movements for correlated variables
      - should show skippable/derivable variables (variables that can be resolved later than they normally are)
      - should show meta forces for overall trends in change rules (direction of combined variable forces)
      - should show limits of measurability & threshold metrics

      - system layer diagram for each interface to allow specification of core interfaces & other interface layers (interface interface)
        - system layer diagram for structures to include layers of structures 
          (beyond core structures like curves, to include n-degree structures like a wave, as well as semantic output structures like a key, crossing the layer that generates info structures like an insight, a probability, etc)
    - map variable structures to prediction potential for problem types, given ratio of equivalent alternate signals
    - vertex variable structures
      - quantum physics, prediction/derivation tools, build automation tools, testing tools, learning/adaptation tools, system rules, computation power are all vertex variables of information, since they can generate/derive/find information

    - core component attributes: identify any missing attributes/functions that cant be reduced further
    - absolute reference connections with metadata structures like networks/paths


# content/config

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths (info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight', system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub')
    - define default & core objects necessary for system to function (out of the box, rather than minimal config necessary to derive other system components & assemble)
      - add default functions to solve common problem types
      - alternate utility function implementations have variation potential in the exact operations used to achieve the function intents, but there are requirements in which definitions these functions use because they are inherent to the system. For example, the embodiment may use a specific definition of an attribute (standardized to a set of filters) in order to build the attribute-identification function using a set of filters - but the general attribute definition is still partially identifyd in its initial version by requirements specified in the documentation, such as a set of core attribute types (input, output, function parameter, abstract, descriptive, identifying, differentiating, variable, constant), the definition of a function, and the definition of conversion functions between standard formats.
    - systematize definitions of info objects
      - include analysis that produces relationships of core objects like opposites to their relevant forms (anti-symmetry) in addition to permuted object states (asymmetry), such as an anti-strategy, anti-information, anti-pattern
      - organize certainty (info) vs. uncertainty objects (potential, risk, probability)
      - make doc to store insight paths, counterintuitive functions, hidden costs, counterexamples, phase shift triggers
      - add technicality, synchronization, bias, counterintuition, & certainty objects leading to inevitable collisions
        - error of the collision of compounding forces producing a phase shift
        - lack of attention in one driver and false panic in a second driver leading to a car crash given the bases where their processes originate
      - define alignment on interfaces (compounding, coordinating, parallel, similar, etc)
      - add core info objects (core strategies, core assumptions) so you can make a network of graphs for a system
    - add function logic for:
      - concept analysis:
        - how new concepts (gaps in network rules) evolve once structure is applied to prior concepts 
      - interface analysis:
        - limitations of interfaces & how to derive them
        - how rules develop on stability & how foundations are connected & destroyed
        - explainability as a space limited by derivable attributes from data set & cross-system similarity
        - vertex definition & give examples (as an intersection/combination of interface variables, such as determining/description(compressing)/generative/causative/derivation variables), around which change develops
      - change analysis:
        - generated object change types
