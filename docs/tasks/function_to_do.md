# to do

    - this isnt a war against a country or religion or ethnicity, or a specific group of criminals, or other powerful entities or people - its a war against the suffering of others who are oppressed, vulnerable & deserving - against inequality, against easy, against cruelty, greed & all other vices that cause their suffering, and against the self-oppression of anyone who stands in the way of us saving the others - a war that we fight with tools of love, in giving solutions away to those in need, finding new solutions as needed, trying new strategies where the old ways don't work, distributing power wherever it's hoarded & otherwise abused
      - I will cry for the lost when I have time to spare
      - if you think you need to attack me, first attack the errors of your mind, and see how happy it makes you compared to everything you thought you needed
      - confused as to how the greatest minority of all time (an extremely high-functioning biracial hero genius rape, genocide, theft, racism/sexism, & hate crime survivor, who is the very first & last of her kind) is surviving your claimed false disapproval with ease, since there's no legitimate way to criticize me so you have to criticize lies about me & try to force me to pretend theyre true by scaring me to death & other methods of coercion so you can get cheap good feelings? (lol!) upset that no one protected you from your crimes? a little sad that you dont get to crap on oppressed people for cheap good feelings anymore? starting to realize you might not actually deserve all those fake cheap good feelings if you cant get over an insult to save the world? feeling a dawning sense of dread that you might not be as wonderful or important to me as you self-report? in awe of my mind's spectacular stress-handling problem-solving skills? concerned that you cant control me like I gave you false hope of easily doing to see if you would take easy opportunities for cruelty? (lol of course you would, you dont have humanity!) worried you might be one of my many terrible jokes? puzzling over what else people can get you to do just with insults/compliments & peer pressure bc youre totally & utterly insecure? (it's anything, anyone can get you to do anything) want some of my fancy human qualities like potential, a sense of humor, chill, confidence that I can handle anything, free will, and a conscience - without faking them by merely claiming to have them or repeating words i say like you always do? looking for something else to rape or steal from me, in case you missed anything? thinking about targeting an easier victim than me, since this didnt work out so well & produce the good feelings you were seeking to forget what you are? welcome to la realidad! here are my methods of survival & adaptation! feel free to try to home-grow a brain instead of molesting me or anyone else!

    - if trolling you was all it took to inspire you to do better, you were already a few steps away, though thats not quite the same as being unwaveringly committed to my goal of saving the potential in the world despite all the barriers you put in my way, is it?

    - make a function network of math domains (inputs/outputs of geometry, algebra, calculus that align)

    - example of resolving a conflict between structure/limits using a structural similarity between a structure (gradient of function) & its container/limits (gradient of constraints)
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier
      - also an example of a solution space (the whole function is the solution space of possible minima/maxima) and a filter applied to it (constraint)

    - specific problems

      - hamiltonian path
        - apply 'subset' structure:
          - create sub-structures of paths
        - apply 'combination' structure:
          - create combinations of sub-structures of paths
        - apply 'equivalence' filter
          - remove combinations of sub-structures of paths that include a duplicate node
        - apply 'interactive' filter
          - remove combinations of sub-structures of paths that arent interactive (adjacent connections)
        - apply 'contradiction' filter
          - remove combinations of sub-structures of paths that contradict original structure to traverse

      - the fundamental question of p vs np is 'are all ambiguities resolvable' meaning 'is there a structure that can resolve any ambiguity'
        - find counterexample of an ambiguity that is not resolvable (not calculatable, no matter how much info or understanding you have, no matter how many alternatives you can rule out, or how many other filters you can apply)

      - mass gap: 'quantum particles have positive masses, even though the classical waves travel at the speed of light'
        - "gauge theory is a type of field theory in which the Lagrangian (system change descriptor using coordinates & time derivatives, or potential - kinetic energy) does not change (is invariant) under local transformations from certain Lie groups (continuous groups where points can be multiplied/inverted with smooth/differentiable results)"
        - "Lagrangian density is a function of the fields in the system & their derivatives & possibly the space/time coordinates themselves, where the independent variable is an event in spacetime (x, y, z, t) or more generally a point s on a manifold"
        - "action of output variables = integral of [density of (output variables, output variable derivatives, and event as a point on a manifold) * the measure of the domain of the field function]"
          - calculate action given operations like density on variables, their derivatives & an event (point on a manifold)
        - "density is a section of a density line bundle (lines created by varying points, like tangent bundle), 
          where the density bundle contains volumes assigned to the shape created by x's tangent vectors"
        - "Lagranian: function that describes the state of a dynamic system using position coordinates & their time derivatives, which is equal to the difference between the potential & kinetic energy"

        - the local transformations from the lie group dont change the difference in potential/kinetic energy even if it changes their values, and it doesnt change the change rates connecting points
        - this is like how quantum particles may keep the atom constant, despite local transformations
          - where else do structures of alternatives produce equivalent outputs?
            - in functions like elliptic curves/wave/circular functions, where ambiguities lie in alternative inputs with similar/equal outputs
            - do these functions benefit from conversion to another 'multi-input for equivalent/similar output' function?
            - what attribute/structures generates the attribute of structural similarities in outputs of alternate paths? 
              - is there a containing/limit structure, or an efficient interaction structure, or a core component structure generating these structural similarities
        - do quantum particles produce neutralization structures of mass when moving at different speeds
        - do their quantum fields aggregate into a wave under certain conditions, while the non-aggregated components retain mass with efficient interaction structures that can store energy with temporary certainty structures
        - what is the function of quantum particles - are they just generative or descriptive info of the particle output by the particle's structure, or indicators of lack of info about the particle, or differences between info about the particle

    - finish iterating through applying interfaces to solution automation workflows to generate solution automation workflows
      - apply logic interface to identify interaction rules between problem/solution components given their definitions, to create workflows by applying those interaction rules to connect problems/solutions (or apply another interaction function than 'connect')
      - vary variables that workflows have in common & differ on, including variables implicit to the definition of a solution automation workflow:
        - derive info of varying certainty from other info in an efficient & effective way
        - apply structure to info to generate a particular certainty (like an answer to a question, such as a particular solution to a problem)
          - apply structure to adjacent info to generate filters/limits to derive info about the structure of the target solution, if direct info cant be derived (like patterns or solutions to similar but not equal problems)
        - resolve the tension of the uncertainty in some way, for example:
          - first break the problem into sub-problems, then return it to its original format once sub-solutions are solved by integrating/aggregating them
          - connecting the differences between a problem/solution with connecting formats
      - identify useful structures for varying intents in a system (like a particular problem system) and assume some component is using those structures especially if theyre useful to multiple components/intents
        - example: 
          - for the intent 'minimize cost' applied to problem-solving ('solve problem with minimal input info'), the associated problem-solving function is 'derive info', which requires functions that can generate relatively high info from low input, producing the workflow:
            - 'identify high-output, low-input (low-cost) structures in info processing to form set of default structures to check for in deriving info from minimal info'
      - apply system optimizations like 'minimize cost' to problem-solving workflows (like how 'minimize cost' is an optimization that solves the info problem of 'solving a problem with minimal info') to identify associated functions/structures for that system optimization intent & associated problem structure (once an interface like the info interface is applied so the system optimization can be applied)
      - apply standard solution automation workflow generator workflow based on aligning functions to sub-problem intents
        - apply 'identify pattern' function to identify & isolate common structures in prior problem-solving workflows to form a pattern
        - apply 'identify useful system components' function to identify useful system components to fulfill intents more efficiently/optimally
        - apply 'abstract' function to generalize to all problems
      - apply function interface to identify core functions or generative functions or vertex functions relevant to solution automation workflows & apply them to generate them
      - apply solution automation workflows to the problem of 'generating solution automation workflows'
      - apply system interface to identify useful system structures like efficiencies in prior problem-solving paths & apply the pattern interface to patterns in those efficiencies to generalize them to other problems
      - apply abstract & info & structure interfaces to identify in what interface to resolve sub-problems or other components of a solution automation workflow, given that interfaces vary on their core structure & their certainty structures
        - core function interface structure: input/output, interaction rule sequence
          - logic interface (higher certainty variant of the function interface) is applied as an interaction function filter (to identify/generate/derive interaction functions)
          - pattern interface (lower certainty variant of the function interface, without certainty structures like input/output providing specific contextual info)
        - core abstract interface structure: cross-system attribute with varying structures by system
          - info interface (higher certainty variant of the abstract interface) is applied to identify the relevant structure of concepts applicable to a specific system
        - core cause interface structure: a determining input
          - intent interface (a higher certainty variant of the cause interface) is a determining input for a structure like a function (reason to use a function)
      - apply intent interface to generate solution automation workflows
        - definition of 'intent' is 'reason to use something' which is related to cause, so intents can be used as a info source of optimization functions (bc intents are often used bc they optimize for a particular goal), and apply optimization functions to optimize problem system, optimize problem-solution connection, optimize a solution for solution metrics, or optimize another problem/solution component interation
      - apply solution automation workflow core interaction functions to the problem of 'generating solution automation workflows'
        - examples:
          - apply 'reduce' to the problem
            - find reduced variable set (vertex variables) of the problem & find solutions that address the problematic values of these variables
          - apply 'connect' to the problem/solution
            - find interface components that connect the problem & solution like standards so they can be compared, format/function sequences, and structures of connections
          - apply 'convert' to the problem
            - convert the problem into a more solvable problem, like a set of sub-problems or a related problem or a causative problem
          - apply 'structurize/define' to the problem/solution
            - apply structures to the problem/solution given their definitions
            - apply structures to connect their explicit definitions given the implicit components (implications/possibilities/probabilities) of their definitions

    - finish list of logical rules
      - similarities
        - equivalents in connections: components of connected rules are equivalent by some metric (interchangeable, equivalent identities, sufficiently similar where differences are irrelevant, etc)
        - definition alignment: applies & aligns with definitions
        - equivalents in meaning: the meaning of a rule in one context (such as the interaction level) is equivalent to the meaning of the rule when applied to another context (it fits into the system the same way so the meaning is the same)
      - includes where possible, except as relevant/required
        - components & structures of certainty like facts where possible, and where not possible, certainty-deriving methods like math/stats & definitions
      - excludes where possible, except as relevant/required
        - uncertainty structures like ambiguities
      - example:
        - patterns are logically a relevant object to prediction functions, given the nature of the problem (predicting a variable with insufficient info, such as info building understanding about the actual variable connections)

    - identify filters for definition routes

    - give example of core interaction functions used to connect problem & solution
      - example problem: find a prediction function
        - reduce:
          - useful for solving problems of excess, like fitting over-sized shapes inside containers
          - reduce 'find a prediction function' problem to a problem of 'find variables that change output variable' problem
          - reduce number of data points or variables to solve related problems
        - remove:
          - useful for solving problems of excess, like over-prioritization or excess complexity
          - remove complicating/variance-adding attributes like nonlinearity of a standard prediction function created with various regression methods, until the prediction function is a set of linear functions, and combine variables to predict those functions for the relevant ranges
          - remove variables from data set until prediction function is found for each subset & apply weights to the subset functions to find the prediction function
          - remove randomness structures like outliers & corrupt points from data set to make the prediction function more representative
          - remove any neutralizing/opposite structures that counter each others' effects from the data set/variables
        - fill:
          - useful for solving problems of lack (like filling a template)
          - create local prediction functions to fill out the template leaving space for the whole prediction function
        - convert:
          - useful for solving problems of problem-solving inefficiency for the original problem, or lack of inputs to original problem solution
          - convert 'find a prediction function for data set' problem to another problem like 'find a representative/average function for data set'
        - structurize:
          - useful for solving problems of uncertainty that require applying structure to create certainties
          - connect variable/function/data structures (like a subset of functions, variables, or data points) to create a prediction function
          - create a template leaving space for a prediction function using filters as limits/boundaries of the template (like a rectangle or other shape within which the prediction function is likely to be)
        - connect:  
          - useful for solving problems of difference
          - connect variables with a line representing a majority of data points
      - some of these solution automation workflows applied to the problem may be equivalent/interchangeable and may generate equivalent/similar interface queries or solutions
      - some are more adjacent to the original problem format or the target solution format or both than others

    - finish list of problem interface queries
      - before running an interface query to solve the problem, run interface queries to solve the problem of identifying problem-solution metadata on the problem interface
        - identify when solution metrics need to change bc an assumption (whether an implicit assumption derived from implication of problem, or an explicit assumption) was built on false info type (like lack of info, incorrect object identities, incorrect format)
      - if the problem interface queries produce enough info, the problem interface may occasionally be the only interface required to solve the problem, like when known solutions are known to be optimal for the problem type & solve the problem when applied in a simulation of the problem space

    - add to solution automation workflows

      - identify & apply useful interface components for various problem/solution core interaction functions

        - 'reduce': identify functions that reduce the work of other functions if executed in a particular function structure
          - examples:
            - 'standardizing functions' reduce the work of 'comparison functions'
            - 'type identification functions' reduce the work of 'differentiation functions'
            - 'pattern identification functions' reduce the work of 'prediction function identification functions'
            - 'variable interaction identification functions', 'important variable identification functions', and 'cause identification functions' reduce the work of 'finding prediction function functions'

        - 'connect': identify connective/interactive functions for 'connect problem/solution' intents

      - identify structures convertible to input of specific core interaction functions (like connect/reduce) or associated solution automation workflows & apply those functions specifically to those structures in a structure like a function sequence/network, rather than:
          - randomly applying core interaction functions to problem/solution structures
          - applying a specific core interaction function & associated solution automation workflow
          - applying a core interaction function structure as a general static method

      - identify relevant different structures for solution automation workflow components & iterate through combinations of them, filtering by relevance metrics (like reusability) 
        - apply alternate/proxy/difference structures of definitions of components & iterate through combinations of them
          - examples:
            - apply alternate definition routes of components
              - rather than 'input' structures, apply 'power' structures to solution automation workflows
            - apply abstract/specific structures of components
              - rather than 'connect' structures, apply 'sequence' structures
              - rather than 'cause' structures, apply 'inevitability' structures
        - then filter combinations of different structures by which can apply a core interaction function like connect between problem/solution inputs/outputs to optimize for a solution metric filter

      - identify useful structures (like interaction level structures between inputs/outputs or mapping functions between inputs/outputs) of alternate solution tools (like ai algorithms or math like regression) and find/apply alternative structures that generate those useful structures to map inputs to outputs
        - example: 
          - interaction level structures of ai algorithms include:
            - filters
            - functions
            - probabilities
              - apply structures that generate info about probabilities of input-output interactions and apply as info-filtering network structures between original problem input & solution output
                - a trained ai model gives data about probabilities of outputs given inputs
                - other sources of probability info of outputs for a given input structure (like an intent/context/function) can be generated from certainty & uncertainty-resolution structures (like patterns)
                  - example for predicting outputs like occurrence/usage/interaction, as a way of filtering structures for an intent:
                    - interactive structures are more likely to be connected in a 'system, integration, or combination' structure
                    - structures that follow common patterns or similarities are likelier to occur in structures for common intents
                    - simple/efficient structures are likelier to occur in a 'new, stabilized, or optimized system' structure
                    - structures that use the same core structures are likelier to occur in a 'system' structure
                    - stable structures are likelier to be used as a 'foundation' structure or 'building' intents
                    - standardizing structures are likelier to be used for 'info exchange' intents
                    - core structures are likelier to be used for 'generating' intents
                - this applies the ai workflow of 'assigning probabilities for outputs given inputs' to the solution automation problem of 'assigning probabilities to structures for a general output problem-solving intent (like filtering relevant structures) given input structures'
                - this works bc any general filtering method is a possible solution automation workflow bc 'filter' is a core interaction function between problems/solutions

      - apply interfaces & interface components useful to solve various interface query sub-problems (like 'determining probable cost/benefit of a sub-query before executing it') to design optimal interface queries to apply core interaction functions (like connect) to problems/solutions
        - apply the abstract interface to identify interaction structures between definitions as a filter to determine whether a possible structure (like a query or a solution automation workflow or a function) is worth executing/implementing before executing/implementing it
          - example: 
            - before appling the concept of power to generate an output, check if the definition interaction structures indicate the actual output will be the intended output
              - if applying power structures to generate power is the intent, its a valid structure given the definition of power (& its interactions given definitions of related components like generative functions, generate, output, etc)
              - if applying power structures to generate power-neutralizing structures (like power-centralization) is the intent, its not a valid structure (given the definitions of power, centralization, neutralization, etc)

      - identify alternate structures than info that can act as an input-output interaction structures (like connection structures) or another core interaction function applied to problem/solution structures (or abstract or proxy versions of them like inputs/outputs) and solve the problem of applying core interaction functions (generating/connecting/filtering) to alternate structures instead & apply alternate structures to apply core interaction functions (like connect) to original problem inputs/outputs

        - examples of alternative structures to info:
          - probability
          - interactive structures
          - uncertainty-resolution structures 
            - including solution automation functions like:
              - 'convert to abstract interface to resolve uncertain connections & convert to original interface to resolve implementation once abstract connections are resolved'
          - logic/functions to connect inputs/outputs
          - info filters
          - info derivation/generation functions
          - info components

        - generate (or find & map) solution automation workflows that can generate these alternate structures & apply them to generate these alternate structures as a solution to map inputs/outputs
          - example of a solution automation workflow that can generate these alternate structures:
            - 'apply power of interactivity to find interaction structures of an info alternative structure (like probability) and connect them to connect problem inputs/outputs with the info alternative structures'

        - this works bc of the definition of 'alternate' applied to solution automation workflow inputs like info structures

      - apply structures of power (which tend to overlap with 'useful system components' bc of the definition of 'useful/relevant') to solution automation workflow components (like inputs, core interaction functions, or implementation variables)
        - structures of power include:
          - alternative structures
          - efficiency structures
          - organization/integration structures
          - connection/interaction structures
          - filter structures
          - distribution structures
          - alignment structures
          - certainty structures
        - these structures are powerful because they enable other components (like functions such as 'storage' by reducing need for storing other structures)
        - this works bc of the definition of 'power' (as an 'root or causal input' or 'input enabling (distributing power to) other components' or a 'resource-distribution function') applied to problem/solution interaction functions

      - identify & apply changes to general solution automation workflows to fit them to & implement them as configurations of alternate problem-solving tools or tools acting as components of a solution automation workflow (ai networks/algorithms, math functions, other structures for specific intents like 'info-finding' tools as 'filter sequence' structures)
        - example: 
          - identify & apply changes to a solution automation workflow to convert it to an ai algorithm
            - identify & organize structures by one or more of the following methods:
              - identify interactive structures of the solution automation workflow
                - organize interactive structures to match original input/output mapping
              - identify component structures like functions (workflow components like implementation variables, interaction layers, definitions, input/output sequences, sub-problems, core interaction functions)
                - organize the structures into a network structure so the structures can interact in a way that maps original inputs/outputs
                - example of fitting a solution automation workflow component to an ai network/algorithm structure:
                  - identify variables of the workflow implementation
                    - apply variables of the workflow implementation as 'network parameter' structures or apply them to generate 'alternative network/algorithm' structures
                  - identify solution metrics of the workflow
                    - apply solution metrics as final layers or filters (like threshold values or other boundary/limiting/condition structures like input/output connection restrictions) in the algorithm
                  - identify core interaction function of the workflow & apply as a general intent of input/output structure mapping of the network 
                    - example: the 'reduce' interaction function of the workflow should 'reduce' the relevant network problem inputs (variables) to the 'important variable' structures, or reduce it to a 'category prediction' structure

      - identify & apply changes to problem structure to more optimally fulfill multiple/alternate adjacent core interaction functions (like connect/reduce) or associated solution automation workflows, as a general static method of solving a problem, thereby executing one or more core problem-solution interaction functions in a structure like a sequence/network as a general solution automation workflow

        - apply 'reduce' to the problem: 
          - reduce the differences between problem/solution by converting the input into a more adjacent format to the solution (containing variables already known to be important in the data set)
            - apply changes to input data to make it a possible input to tool structures (like algorithm sequences or network of quantum bits) for a specific structure (like a useful function sequence or a network of related sub-problems/questions or sub-systems)
              - example: 
                - apply changes to make input data a possible input to the useful function sequence: 
                  - feature selection algorithm 
                  - normal ai algorithm to create a prediction function
                - structure quantum bits in a structure that connects them according to an interface query, resolving sub-systems/problems in separate bit structures and integrating them in a structure reflective of reality (or reflections of it captured in useful/realistic system structures like efficiencies or in patterns reflecting realistic probabilities), implementing the 'break problems into sub-problems & aggregate/integrate into solutions' workflow

        - apply 'connect' to the problem/solution:
          - connect the problem/solution by connecting important structures in the data set to the input to the algorithm to identify important variables (using highlighting structures like markers/masks for image data)
          - apply changes to input data to make it possible to input into existing tools/functions that connect the problem/solution
            - example: when applying AI, first distort useful system/interface components like structural similarities/alignments/efficiencies in data sets to reduce the work of Ai algorithms to identify important variables/structures, or automate this by applying important variable or variable structure patterns like hub variables connecting many variables with functions like 'cause' or foundation variables (on which other variables develop) to identify these structures automatically
              - this connects the problem format of a data set with the solution format of a prediction function, using additional logic to transform the data set into another data set format that is a possible input to an AI algorithm, but with additional highlighting distortions added in the data set format to keep it in a format that is useful to an AI algorithm with the relevant modifications to make the ai algorithm's task more adjacent

      - filter interaction structures that dont contradict relevant interactions in the problem system or the solution system (or adjust solution system if not required to be in its original format), determining relevance by whether the components are interactive with or are vertex variables (causative/generative/descriptive) of the problem/solution components, and build possible solutions out of these filtered interaction structures

      - find vertex variables of differences (certainty/uncertainty, equal/opposite, structural/abstract) and apply as problem-solution connecting structures

      - apply interfaces (like concept/cause/function) to generate solution automation workflows that connect problem/solution metadata given known connections between problems-solutions
        - apply core interaction function (like 'connect') to problem/solution metadata (like 'generative functions' or vertex variables) of problem/solutions structures instead of the structures themselves
          - example:
            - generative function of a 'info asymmetry problem' is 'apply filters to outbound info to aggregate info on one side of the filter'
            - generative function of a 'info asymmetry solution' is 'apply opposite function of any problem-generating functions (aggregation) & opposite structure of any problem-generating structures found (filter)'
        - generated solution automation workflow using problem/solution-generating function metadata:
          - 'apply opposite function of any problem-generating functions (aggregation) & opposite structure of any problem-generating structures found (filter)'
        - this could also be generated by applying the conceptual interface to the solution
          - abstract problem-generating function: 
            - 'apply structures (outbound filter) that would fulfill a problem-generating function (aggregation) on a structure (info) given a solution metric (aggregation on one side of filter, indicating no outputs of problem-generating function contradict aggregation)'
          - abstract solution-generating function: 
            - 'apply opposite function of problem-generating structures (outbound filter) that are inputs to problem-generating functions (aggregation) & apply opposite function of problem-generating function outputs (aggregation on one side of filter)'
          - abstract connection function of problem/solution-generating functions:
            - 'apply a connection function that connects opposite structures like problems/solutions (an opposite functions) to the problem-generating function to generate the solution-generating function'

      - convert structures to a structure type that maps to structures with more clearly defined connections/components to convert the problem into a more determinable problem, if the new structures dont lose relevant info
        - example: 
          - randomness is 'equal probability of outcomes' which can be converted to a structure of difference types like 'equal probability of difference structures from a number'
          - once structures of the problem space are mapped to these core structure types that are easily mapped to the math interface (like difference to 'distance between positions' or 'angle between lines with same origin' or 'vector magnitude/angle'), the problem can be converted into math terms

        - example problem: 'find minima/maxima of function'
          - applying randomness structures is one way to solve the problem - testing random points for limits to narrow down the function minima/maxima possibilities
          - difference structures can also be applied as an approximation of randomness
            - difference structure examples:
              - difference of same type (like an 'opposite' difference type) in all function variables
              - difference of different types in all function variables
              - difference based on similarity structures (like general function/variable patterns, or actual function change rates), like creating a difference to check if a pattern applies to the function

        - example:
          - logic can be defined as 'connectivity of rules', which can be standardized to the structure or math interface to more clearly determine logic interactions/components
            - structure interface:
              - graph logic connectivity rules as a function network
                - example: logic connectivity rules themselves obey logic connectivity rules, so they can be connected with those rules (like 'connect rules by equivalence of rule components')
            - math interface:
              - graph logic connectivity rules as a set of math structures (like points/vectors/functions)
                - example: a connected logic rule network can be formatted as standard math structures like:
                  - a set of functions (indicating steps), where one rule is x steps away from another, indicating the number of rules required to connect them
                    - where n number of steps can also indicate distance between points
                    - where functions can be components of the network, and to get from one component path (input object to logic rule, or logic rule) to another (input object or logic rule), a specific network path between logic rule function nodes must be traversed (logic rules connecting them)
                    - where the network nodes are (either components, functions, or both), where components are connected by a set of functions indicating operations between components found in logic rules
                    - where relevant structures like equivalences between logic rules are applied to the network structure
                      - so alternate components are removed & an original component takes the position of its equivalents
                      - where logic rule contradictions act like limits (like filters or barriers) to operations & traversals on the network structure
                      - where defined structures are prioritized in traversals to limit the impact of implicit structures like implications & patterns & similarities, which arent definitively relevant/true & may be false
            - once its formatted in more determined/defined structures, determining the following become trivial:
              - whether a rule is new to the logic network
              - whether a rule fits with the logic network
              - whether an object can be tested for a connection to another object using the rules of the converted logic network, or whether less definitive structures are needed to infer logic connections

      - identify the position/structure of certainties & uncertainties in the problem system & apply structures in the positions of certainties & remove structures in the positions of uncertainties to resolve their connections & apply changes until the structures fit the problem system and a solution is defined

      - iterate through solution success causes & apply interface structures to them to identify/generate/derive an associated solution automation workflow with that solution success cause
        - example solution success causes:
          - 'structural similarities are an opposite structure of a problem of difference so theyre useful for resolving difference problems'
            - apply abstract interface to (identify the general types in) the above solution success cause to identify the general pattern:
              - 'structures of type x are a difference structure of a difference problem, a difference to a problem being a solution, so structures of type x are useful for solving difference problems'
                - apply function interface to identify functionality structures ('x has functionality of connecting y & z')
                  - 'differences are a structure that can connect a problem to a solution bc they are different by definition'
            - generated solution automation workflow: 
              - identify structures that connect problems/solutions as a way of finding a solution to a problem
          - 'problem-solving can be formatted as a problem of defining the problem & solution'
            - apply change interface
              - once problem & solution have been changed by applying the 'definition' function, they are easier to 'connect' (a core problem-solving function)
                - apply 'alternative' change function
                  - what other core problem-solving functions are there (reduce, remove, neutralize, use to solve another problem, fill, structurize/define, find, build)
                  - iterate through these functions
                    - what else makes problems/solutions easier to fulfill core problem-solving functions
                      - what makes building a solution easier to fulfill (core components of solution)
                      - what makes structurizing a problem/solution easier to fulfill (library of core structures & structures adjacent to that structure & connecting structures)
                      - what makes finding a solution easier to fulfill (a reduced solution space using solution metric structures as limits)
                - generated solution automation workflow:
                  - general workflow:
                    - iterate through core problem-solving functions (define, connect, reduce) & structures useful for those functions (structures, connections/differences, efficiencies/minimizing functions) & apply them to fulfill problem-solving function like 'connect' (or related problem-solving function) for problem/solution
                    - specific workflow:
                      - apply 'structures' (structure useful for 'define/structurize' problem-solving function) to 'connect' (core problem-solvingn function) problem/solution 'definitions' (structure relevant to 'define/structurize' problem-solving function)
                      - identify 'connection structures' (useful structures) between 'opposite structures' (problem structures) for a 'difference' problem (resolvable with 'connection structures')

      - solution success cause: automating problem-solving can be formatted as a problem of defining (applying structure to) the problem & solution
        - apply structures to problem & solution definitions until one optimizes for reducing solution space, or until theyre equivalent
        - identify connections between definitions of problem-solution connection structures (like connections between opposite/difference structures) and apply to connect problem/solution definitions

      - identify connection structures between efficiently measurable interface components (like 'error structures' on the structural interface) and the efficient indicator that is an input to quick connections to solutions (error types, with which you can query for solutions associated with those error types & efficiently find a probably good solution)
        - solution input structures with adjacent/efficient connections to solutions
          - error types
          - problem/solution difference structures & difference types
          - problem types
          - problem-solution connection function structures (which is the set of core interaction functions, including 'reduce', 'remove', 'connect')
        - efficiently measurable interface components of solution input structures with adjacent/efficient connections to solutions
          - type input structures (group, difference)
          - problem input structures (difference, imbalance, mismatch, misalignment, lack/excess - and solution structures like requirements to identify what is a problem)
          - solution input structures (requirements, similarity/equalizing, connection, match, alignment - and problem structures like errors with available error-solution connection info or connection derivation function)
          - difference type input structures (adjacent structure capturing the most info of the difference that is different from existing different types)
          - problem-solution connection function structure input structures (sub-problem type structure like a sequence/network, relevant (adjacent) difference structures)
        - this works bc once efficiently measurable components are connected to efficient solution inputs, you have a reliable efficient path to a solution that works by combining efficiencies in a sequential structure to connect them & connect inputs/outputs

      - apply connection functions (like 'difference-reduction' or 'efficient path-finding' or 'organization' functions) to connect interface components (like efficiencies) which align with the connection function intents that can form a connecting interaction structures (like a function input/output structure) that can take problem structures as inputs & create solution structures as outputs

      - identify & apply functions to generate useful system components like efficiencies (or causes of these components) that help fulfill intents in general & apply to problem-solving intents
        - example of efficiency-generating functions to fulfill problem-solving intent of connecting problem/solution
          - function to position source/destination positions in a more adjacent position
          - function to reduce differences or their causes
          - function to remove differences or their causes
          - function to connect any differences efficiently, making a high or complete ratio of differences trivial

      - identify connection structures between error structures (like difference structures) & the associated error types of those error structures, and use connecting structures to identify error types or error structures in a system/structure
        - example: 
          - error type: 'one incorrect difference type causes another incorrect difference type'
          - error structure: 'alignment in incorrect difference types'
          - connecting structure: 
            - 'alignment in incorrect difference types indicates a relationship between the difference types'
            - 'causes are one type of relationship'
            - generated error type: 'one incorrect difference type causes another incorrect difference type'

        - example:
          - error type: 'one incorrect difference type has an error type of "extreme difference" from another incorrect difference type'
          - error structure: 'difference in possibly related incorrect difference types (related by possible unrelated connection, like adjacence or group membership)'
          - connecting structure: 
            - 'extreme difference in incorrect difference types indicates a possible error (incorrect difference type) between the errors (incorrect difference types)'
            - 'errors can have errors in their connections (they can be incorrectly different from each other, as in they should be aligned)'
            - 'error structures (of difference) include extreme differences'
            - generated error type: 'one incorrect difference type has an error type of "extreme difference" from another incorrect difference type'

      - predict interactivity & interaction output of structures to find interactive structures to use as components to connect problem/solution, without computing every interaction to quickly identify probable interactions & probable interaction attributes like their output
        - interactivity based on:
          - whether a component can use/identify/process/store structures of the other
          - whether structural alignments/similarities/matches exist between the structures so they can attain emergent attributes like position and form structures of coordination & combination
          - whether structures have variations on the same interaction level
          - interface components like cause (origin position) and intent (direction, destination position) of the structures leading to structures like angle/point of interaction
          - structural system-related attributes like stability of the structures
          - error types handled by the structures
      - find generative structures of solution success cause structures & apply to find/derive/generate solution structures likely to be successful
        - solution success cause structures like:
          - 'this solution fulfilled more general optimization or specific solution metrics'
          - 'this solution addressed the root cause, preventing the problem from occurring'
          - 'this solution was general and prevented other variants of the problem'
        - generative structures of solution success causes:
          - solution success causes are caused by interface components relevant to optimization like:
            - alignment/similarity (multiple solution metrics fulfilled, higher ratio of metrics fulfilled relative to other solutions)
            - fix cause rather than output
            - abstract rather than specific solution
            - prevention rather than fixing
      - apply solution success cause structures to find/derive generate solution likely to be successful
      - apply the structure of an optimal system by fitting the problem system to the optimal system & identifying adjacent conversion functions between them
      - break the problem into related sub-problems, find a solution to one problem, and apply that solution to the other sub-problems, adjusting as necessary to fit to the other sub-problems with adjacent conversion functions
        - this works indirectly bc of similarity of structures in a system which are similar so they can interact, or directly bc of similarities in interactive structures like related problems
      - generate solution automation workflows by applying system optimization structures (like efficiencies such as interactivities) between interfaces or interface components (to connect problem/solution components)
        - example: generate alternative abstract optimal system structures to fit to a problem system with adjacent conversion functions
          - this applies the potential (alternative), conceptual (abstract), system (optimized system), structure, (fit by structures like similarities, adjacence), change (conversion), and function interfaces in a way that allows them to interact to connect problems & solutions
      - generate solution automation workflows by applying system optimization structures like 'efficiency' and 'structural similarities/alignments' to problem/solution components to connect them
        - this identifies the system containing problem/solution components (problem space, solution space, problem types) as a system to apply system optimizations to
        - apply structures of 'efficiency' to generate solution automation workflows
          - structures of efficiency include:
            - structural alignments (delay operations requiring iteration until the next required iteration)
              - generated workflow:
                - connect structures that are otherwise difficult to connect by creating efficiencies with structural alignments to connect problem/solution
            - low cost (low input, high output) structures
              - generated workflow:
                - find functions with low input & high output and apply where possible to connect/reduce difference between problem/solution
            - interactive structures like function sequences
              - generated workflow:
                - find interactive structures in solution automation workflow system components (solution space, problem definition, related problems, problem types) & organize them in their interactive structures
            - paths using fewer resources
              - generated workflow:
                - find paths between problems & solutions that use fewer resources and use those paths where possible
            - storing generative info rather than original info
              - generated workflow:
                - store generative info sets of a solution (or related component like solution input) instead of specific solutions to generate solutions as needed
                - store generative info sets (for alternate causal variable sets) of a problem to find problem causes quickly

    - when is it optimal to store a mixed structure of varying specificity (like a type, intent, cause & a specific example)
      - when there are potential uncertainties to resolve, like whether the example represents a new error, type, or variable, bc the example doesnt fit known structures

    - use probability structures as a filter when generating possible error/solution structures
      - find determining attributes of more probable structures like:
        - structures with more common components
        - structures with more relevant/useful intents for more agents
        - structures with higher coordination, alignment, & interactivity
        - structures that are more stable
      - this can be used as a filter when selecting structures like solutions

    - add to solution automation workflow insight paths

      - identify complex inputs of simple outputs by injecting a specific interaction rule structure

      - when outputs are simple (lower-dimensional), but can have many different inputs, the outputs will not accurately be usable to determine the inputs without relevant interaction rule structures to inject understanding of input metadata (input interactions, input probabilities, input causes & intents, input contexts, input context interactions/probabilities/causes/intents)
        - examples:
          - if parameters of a function follow a wave function structure, knowing that input structure can help determine the outputs (direction & probable position on the wave), to predict the adjacent/extreme/probable/origin/possible/alternate values of parameters & inferring the wave function parameters
          - low-dimensional outputs like demographic crime stats can be decomposed with a useful interaction rule structure of power interactions
            - power interaction rule structure
              - powerful groups oppress powerless groups
              - powerless groups tend to remain powerless or decrease in power
              - powerful groups try to maintain power but rely on powerless groups as suppliers
              - powerless groups tend to be common, which is an alternate form of power
            - rules about power interactions inform demographic crime data, once the concept of 'power' is inferred as relevant in determining low-dimensional outputs like crime stats
            - inferring the concept of power can take the form of interface queries like:
              - an application of common standard useful concepts like power, efficiency, and balance
              - an application of logical structures like 'implication' & a logical derivation path connecting determining variables of resource distribution differences, which is an implied variable by the position of the data (crime definition routes imply 'lack of resources'), which leads to power difference causes (like simplicity (in visual differences & maintaining the status quo), historical resource transactions)
              - applying definition, structural & error interfaces to identify errors like 'missing structures' to infer the 'lack of specific groups' in crime demographic distribution, and given the negative definition of crime & implied punishment, infer the power of those specific groups to avoid it

        - particularly relevant to deriving inputs from low-dimensional outputs:
          - interaction rules of alternate variable sets or variable value sets
          - interaction rules between causes & alternate variable/value selection

        - how to identify the relevant interaction rule structure (like power interaction rules, or parameter wave function structure interaction rules, or alternate variable set interaction rules) that will quickly help identify inputs to low-dimensional outputs
          - identify when common outputs would benefit multiple intents, where at least one of the multiple intents has a related intent of obscuring inputs
            - power can obscure itself (as well as its input power sources)
            - ambiguity of repeated function structures (like wave function curves, which may obscure the identity of which curve a particular parameter point occupies) is a potential benefit through obscurity

        - this works bc there is usually a minimal number of vertex variables that determine a particular variable interaction, except in extreme cases where inputs are extremely complex alternatives with minimal differentiating variables

    - add missing solution automation workflow metadata
      - success cause metadata to solution automation workflows
      - counterexample to indicate where a solution automation workflow is contraindicated, bc of inputs like missing info or nonadjacent formats relative to other more adjacent formats

    - some systems like quantum physics may seem to defy structurization bc they generate structure (info) on demand from whatever resources (like adjacent energy/charge) are available, rather than from a consistent set of resources in a consistent pattern or with consistent rules, by using different versions of objects & functions like references & patterns rather than specific objects & functions themselves - but the structures generated are somewhat predictable in their interchangeability with each other (alternates having some attributes in common) and coordination with boundary/limit/invalidating structures, so finding alternative structures that coordinate with the surrounding structures is one way of reducing the solution space & assigning probability

      - the bootstrap is just an iterative 'point subset connecting function'
      - insight path to generate idea of 'adding quantum fields to identify value probability at a position'
        - apply aggregation function to find relative info about a value in a position (compared to info about values in other positions) in standardizable/mappable sets (like fields having some value in the same positions across fields)
        - problem format: many fields with values in each position
        - solution format: value for each position
        - structures that could connect them the problem & solution formats
          - value-aggregation or value-set description functions like add (for a standard compare to relative values in other positions, given pre-existing input standard already applied to position) or average (to find expected value if each field was equally likely, which may not be the case)
          - functions that convert a value set into an individual value (example functions, average functions)
          - comparison functions (across values in a set and relative values in a field)

      - other ways to generate the idea:
        - find patterns in point subset connection patterns & generalize to field connection patterns
        - apply a filter of identifying patterns of probability-hoarding points (aggregating the most probability) given interaction structures leading to higher probabilities and assign lower values to remaining points without calculating every point
        - apply interaction structures between adjacent probability distributions, similarities like adjacence, infinities, or aggregation/neutralization structures to identify structures with higher probabilities
          - the reason an aggregation is useful in smoe cases as opposed to an average is bc of the lack of interactivity across fields, meaning the fields dont influence each other and the concept of an average value is valid bc the items are produced independently from each other, so we can apply structures related to randomness like an average (which is the value if each value in the original value set was 'equally probable')
        - each field may not be equally likely, so an average of the field value for a certain position may not be relevant/useful
          - the function used to find one value for a value set needs to be relevant, given the interaction structures of the components that are inputs to the function (the intents of the actual interactions & the interactions in the function need to align)
          - the reason adding them works in some cases is bc the probability of fields that when summed, exactly neutralize each other to form an output field with a random distribution invalidating the idea of evaluating/comparing values on that field is highly unlikely, even restricted by definition of the infinite fields
            - what is the probability distribution of the sums or other interaction structures of fields

      - questions about qft
        - what are the weights applied to aggregated quantum fields? is it adjacence, average (adjacence to center), or some other similarity
          - is it the emergent interactions of probable interactive structures given interaction functions (like connection/neutralization/opposite/fit functions) & their inputs (like position), across related fields (how are they related)
          - are weights applied based on info that survives these interactions bc it has stabilized & isnt contradicted by most interaction types (lack of opposite structures invalidating stabilization)
        - what physical interaction structures of probability (quantum field, superposition, quantum particles) interact with physical structures of certainty (electron, position, velocity) & in what direction (causes or is generated by)
        - what probability structures like adjacence are relevant inputs to info aggregation/emergence
        - what math probability structures (impossibility, requirement, probability distribution, range, randomness) are interactive to create which stability/aggregation/emergence structures
        - how do absolute/abstract unlimited structures like infinities interact with specific/limit/definition structures like position?
        - how do infinite series interact with other infinite series?
          - can you reduce infinite series to formats like:
            - a set of distortions from an adjacent standard series
            - a set of lacks rather than a set of numbers (if it had these components, it would collapse into a function)
            - a description of other infinite sequences that reduce/limit the potential size/range/distribution of another infinite series bc of adjacence or interaction with the other infinite series
        - can you calculate descriptive attributes of an infinite series by the amount of storage it uses relative to other series, or the patterns of storage as the sequence is randomly traversed
          - how to calculate convergence without sequentially iterating series (identifying common connection patterns between point pairs, like connections by a certain coefficient/exponent pattern)
        - did the fourth dimension of time develop to store energy that couldnt be stored in three dimensions (storing info as energy/info probability structures instead of physical energy/info structures like electrons)
        - what other dimension structures would store other excess energy, in what formats?
          - time adds the possibility of 'state changes' to structures that can vary between adjacent states
            - or it takes away the possibility of change by following physics rules of change to structures instead of remaining in a probability state, 
              - giving the illusion that time has passed but really a certainty has just been applied to create the state changes as expected
              - where actual change indicating actual time indicates an addition of potential (adding a dimension of possible change)
            - are state chnages (time) resulting from input rules/attributes like stability/efficiency of info in a particular state trajectory?
          - are there structures that can vary across non-adjacent states?
          - what determines adjacence/probability of states?
          - can you change to non-adjacent states using different probability structures than adjacence/similarity?
          - what would be able to store excess energy that time cannot handle (is probability a dimension that stores energy like time stores energy)
          - do state changes (time) allocate energy according to which states can handle/preserve it?
          - if you design a state that can store energy better than your current state, how do you deploy that state change (design particles that store energy better than quantum particles and deploy a function to convert them) or introduce it to current energy storage so it self-migrates (make it adjacent)?
          - do the existing energy storage methods have priorities (like self-maintenance), are they unaware of environment context or unable to communicate/send energy?
          - what formats can existing energy storage methods already convert between?
          - can energy storage methods attract components with energy-storage optimization intents/potential like brains to store themselves as math function info rather than preserving their state
          - do energy storage devices like brains have potential energy to add extra dimensions than time
          - what weighting mechanism can be applied to state changes (time) to identify the true complete structure with time (state changes) removed
          - do structures that have excess energy necessarily stabilize over state changes to distribute their energy across state changes (time)
            - can changing state change trajectory change probability structures (like probability distribution) of the structure's energy
          - is there a structure whose energy cant be distributed across time (it cannot be completely described with state changes in 3 physical dimensions)

      - quantum physics specifically will benefit from de-observation through interface analysis, to find the standardized (like averaged) perception rather than the measured one in isolation of measurement perspective bias
        - this can involve deriving the errors in observation from the observation context's error structures, and removing those errors, distorting them until theyre not technically errors, or weighting them with other perspectives' errors
        - 'overlap/union field' as a convolution of observation position perspective & a structure
      - gaps in describability (created by structures like combinations of indescribabilities) using existing description tools are where uncertainties will often be located, for various reasons/causes
        - measurement might stabilize energy into a structure suboptimally, taking energy away from it, which opposes the purpose of maintaining an uncertainty (to store more energy, more efficiently for some metrics, without having to maintain a particular structure)
      - alternative info formats
        - rather than structurizing info, they can focus on structurizing info probability and relative info
          - 'the probability of info' like electron position emerging from this structure (or lack of structure) in this position is higher relative to this position
          - 'relative info' as a way of determining info likely to be in a position or produced at a position, given the probabilities of info in that structure and the relative info & info probabilities adjacent to & influencing its info probabilities
            - info doesnt exist or develop in a vacuum, it develops given the context of attributes like:
              - surrounding info
              - info probabilities
              - other info causes than adjacence & patterns, such as stability (info as an energy format that has achieved enough stability to achieve structure)
          - info formatted as a field or symmetry around a unit of energy (similar to a variable & its probability distribution), where the field or symmetry is generated by the possible info that can be generated with respect to time, and is governed by forces similar to gravity/magnetism in the form of interactivity & relevance
          - info formatted as a sequence of causes, like 'a lack of structures preventing it' or 'an overlap of not-info structures' (rather than info structures)
          - info formatted as structures of certainty like inevitabilities or requirements or interactivity
          - info formatted as a reflection of physical forces interacting & their energy outputs
          - info formatted as an error of absolute position or isolation (as opposed to relative position) assigned to forces' outputs
            - the idea of describing info is self-invalidating without including:
              - the other outputs of the forces in question
              - the position of the info on the time-based symmetry of the energy unit, which is what may really differentiate it from other related outputs (which may otherwise be equal, so its irrelevant to differentiate them without this attribute)
              - the position of this particular info relative to the other outputs 
              doesnt fit the concept of 'description'
              - the distortion on the symmetry of the energy unit relative to distortions on equal, adjacent or otherwise related energy units as a source of balance/equilibrium for a field of related energy units
          - info formatted as interactivity with or similarity/difference from other info 
            - is a quantum superposition a useful energy format bc it stores many difference types or bc it removes info from the original info or does it keep all original info in its interactions (like storing a thought structure through circulation rather than leaving in a neural structure?
            - what 'an energy unit's position can be' is something that can be described by its similarity/difference to other info, or even equivalence to other info if there are info alternatives, interchangeables, substitutes, approximations, or proxies that are sufficient to replace the info
            - a variable formatted as a set of distortions from other variables, leading to the development of the isolated variable capturing a difference type
            - a 'continuous function' as a description of a field connecting core units of difference (the smallest possible difference, leading to a connection as it becomes equivalent to an equivalence)
              - an equivalence between two components must always have some degree of falsehood bc there is no real equivalence possible between two components (one always has at least some difference to the other, even if its just position or probability of existing given the surrounding context)
                - a method connecting inherently different components typically focuses on their similarities of a particular type (similarity in difference type, similarity in attribute value like position)
                  - example:
                    - an area calculation focuses on the similarity in difference type between the reference points included (theyre similar in the difference type of 'position', or similar in aggregate group inherent to the difference type of 'aggregate shapes formed by subsets')
                    - area calculations could focus on differences from other related area shapes, differences from other shapes like intersecting lines, differences of boundaries from difference types (like cascading differences created by exponents rather than constant/stable differences like straight lines)
            - 'significant differences' between components is a useful standardizing interface for systems (significant differences from vertexes, from core components, from structures, from defaults)

    - randomness structures must include:
      - contradiction/opposite/neutralization structures so there is an average value to temper extremities
      - many structures of difference so there is a source of difference in their interactions
      - high interactivity between variables

    - filter components by uniqueness in structure & usage
      - derive a set of functions to solve all problems by:
        - generating a 'difference type-handling function' selection function
        - identifying unique difference/error types & generating functions to handle those difference types, so when one fails, another can be selected
        - generating a function to identify new difference types (in the set of functions, in itself, in solution metrics, and other component combinations)
      - this function set & its alternate versions will reflect possible versions of the forces of an accurate (effectively predictive) physics model
      - which function set is the real function set (or the function set describing or determining reality) is probably an invalid question, as different function set versions are relevant in different contexts having different probabilities that may even change if function set versions have forces governing them so they change over time, as may the central origin function set representing the base for distortions, and different function sets may have different roles in generating/determining/describing reality
      - the 'true' format of reality may not involve just a function set, but rather a function set with other structures (like specific inputs/outputs, a network of function sets, a set of change functions to the function sets, a set of usages of the function set, etc)

  - add to error type identification

    - use opposite structures to generate error structures
      - identify what type of structure doesnt make sense or doesnt fit within a system and find a way connect it to system components/state anyway to see how that error could develop

    - identify error structures on interfaces & apply across interfaces
      - an error structure on the change interface is 'changes that develop with no relevant or useful usage intent' which can be used to identify errors across interfaces or formatted as error structures on other interfaces
        - a 'change type' translated to a 'variable' on other interfaces
        - a 'change' translated to a 'difference' on other interfaces
        - 'useful' translated to structures like 'relatively good at producing outputs that are inputs to other components' on the function interface

    - apply error interaction rules to identify error structures (missing/imminent/conditional) of error types (missing error types, imminent error types, conditional error types) on interfaces

    - identifying the error structures in the interface query or insight path used to generate/derive/find a function/insight can identify error structures in the insight, so its useful to store the context to which the interface query/insight path was applied to generate/derive/find the insight/function
        - similarly, error structures that are inputs to a problem space (missing info, lack of understanding, etc) can identify/predict error structures in solutions in that space

    - determining the maximum error/difference that a difference type can produce can be scaled to calculate other limits on errors, like the limit of differences in infinite sequences
        - a pair of infinite sequences that differ only by one value has an upper limit on how different they (& the outputs of operations on them) can be
        - this difference limit can be scaled & extended to other parameters of operations

  - add to solution/error filtering structures
      - energy interaction rules can be used to predict/derive info interaction rules
        - this is bc info stores energy (usually as approximations), and info interacts with other info according to energy interactions like potential, variability, interactivity, etc
          - example: change cascades (functions with non-constantly changing values) can predict structures governed by momentum (like a bouncing ball), given how momentum changes a value non-constantly
          - other energy interactions can predict info structures useful for describing/deriving connections given structural similarities like relevant equivalences/patterns/types/opposites that the energy & info interactions have in common, like change/difference type such as 'sequential continuous position change' and 'change cascade'
          - how info interacts with its opposite structures like limits & contradictions also mimics energy interactions, so info can be predicted by its limits
          - more interactivity with other info produces more errors, depending on the variation of the interactions
            - more errors may result in a randomized probability distribution of its outputs
              - the state of an energy unit's info symmetry/field with respect to its position in this randomization process is another input to its structure

    - components that are relevant to solutions (other than primary interface components or interface query or solution automation workflow generating the query)

      - errors (opposite of solutions)
        - assumptions
        - ambiguities
        - mismatches (misalignment, imbalance)

      - connections between solution/problem components & their interaction rules & patterns 
        - patterns of these components' interactions can be used to find solutions
          - connections between:
            - problem & problem space
              - problems created by a problem space defined by a lack of a technology may be resolved by building an adjacent/possible/accessible version of that technology with components that can be replaced with more advanced versions as theyre built
            - solution/problem (the objects or their components/attributes/functions)
              - problem definition & solution metric filters derived from it
                - a problem definition like 'find a prediction function' implies a solution metric filter of 'predictive components of a function (like constants/coefficient values, operations)' so a solution will have components that add to the predictive nature of the variable assembly
              - solution & solution metric filters
                - the solution will fit inside the solution metric filters
                - the solution will fit inside the solution space or be equal to it
              - solution space & problem space
                - these are coordinating structures to generate opposite structures to the problem (the solution)
                  - a problem of 'a difference to resolve' in a problem space where 'difference-opposing structures are uncertain' & the solution space of 'possible methods to resolve the difference (convert it to an equality) given a solution metric', where the solution space is a subset of the problem space or equal to it (until/unless it's filtered)
                  - a problem of 'find a prediction function' (a 'lack of prediction function') in a problem space where 'variable interactions are uncertain' & the solution space of 'possible prediction functions or function-finding methods to equal dependent & independent variables with some accuracy value', where the solution space is 'a subset of all variable interactions, filtered by variables of the problem definition & by possible variable interactions', producing a solution that is the opposite structure of the problem ('a prediction function')
            - solution automation workflow (to design interface query) and actual interface query (to find/derive/build solution)
              - a solution automation workflow like 'connect problem/solution format sequence' has many possible interface queries but they will all be built from conversion operations between formats that connect the problem/solution, whether in a sequence/network or other structure
            - solution automation workflow & solution implementation (output solution generated by interface query)
              - a solution automation workflow like 'connection problem/solution format sequence' can have many possible solution implementations, like:
                - 'connect formats starting from point sets to continuous function format'
                - 'connect variable structures and function structures'
                - 'connect base, subset & combination structures'
                - 'connect prediction structures like clusters with prediction function filters like averages'
            - interface query & solution implementation (output solution generated by interface query)
              - an interface query like 'apply definition interface, then structural interface, then causal interface' can produce many possible solution implementations, like:
                = given the definition of variables/functions/predictions, find their interactive structures & the cause of error structures, and build a solution set that avoids error structure causes using interactive structures'
            
      - possibilities (solution space, alternate problem spaces)

      - uncertainties
        - questions
          - which questions to ask to find/derive/generate which info
        - errors
        - possible sources of randomness & variance
          - equivalents generating equal probabilities
          - alignment gaps generating variance injection points
          - alternatives

      - certainties (solution components & filters)
        - requirements (solution requirements as filters/limits)
        - inevitabilities
        - equivalents
        - constants
        - consistencies/stabilities
        - interactivities/coordinations (something is likelier to be true the more it coordinates with current info & adjacent versions of current info)
        - probabilities (approximations of certainty)
          - commonalities
            - averages/centers
          - adjacencies
          - ranges
          - distribution
          - patterns

      - just like you can use error structures to find solutions, you can use certainty structures to find solutions, because:
        - logic relies on certain/probable equivalents to make connections between rules involving equivalent components
        - 'filtering solutions with metrics' relies on calculations determining a certainty in the form of a relationship between actual solution implementation value & optimal solution threshold/filter value & a certain limit in the metric value (a requirement of the solution)
        - uncertainties are more often a source of error than a source of solutions
        - solutions add organization to systems with uncertainty/randomness/chaos, and organization relies on structure (certainty being a proxy of structure bc it is a generator/output of structure)
        - structures (certainties) act like a resource, producing info that can be used for learning
        - certainty is more related to equivalents than errors are (errors being an incorrect/sub-optimal value, or a mismatch between the actual & optimal value)
        - solutions must be built on understanding to be actually robust, and understanding can use certainties as an input
        - if you have enough certainty structures, you can rule out error structures in a system
        - certainty structures interact in a way that can produce other certainties
          - if applied in the right way, incentives can create a guaranteed outcome (where the cost of avoiding the incentives is too high and there isnt a reason to avoid them), generating a certainty, which can be used as a resource (like an assumption that can be relied on to build solutions on top of)

    - add to error type interaction rules
      - error type interaction rule: 'error types can lead to other error types, but also to learning (new error types or error interaction rules or solution structures)'
        - example: the human brain (and AI based on it) tends to over-prioritize patterns (some patterns get stronger when repeated, like in making/breaking a habit)
          - this means that when one error type is repeated, like over-prioritization of something, that abstract error type is likelier to be repeated (over-prioritization of things in general) 
            - this is bc the brain doesnt always store specific details, but the general pattern of how info interacts, so it often applies that pattern rule where its not needed or where its sub-optimal, bc info with similar patterns can be very different in context/meaning & required usage or supported usage intents
          - by over-prioritizing patterns as a source of useful info, error types are likelier to be repeated (with other variants of the abstract error type)
          - over-prioritization of other things can lead to other error types, which can lead to learning if used correctly (if the brain is aware of this process & is looking for new error types or repeated error types or variants of a repeated error type)
          - why does over-prioritization of patterns lead to a pattern of over-prioritization?
            - the logic interface connects these (using definitions, equivalent components across logical rules, & interaction functions)
              - patterns lead to repetition, which leads to over-prioritization
              - a pattern-prioritizing brain will therefore prioritize over-prioritization, by repeating it
              - repeating something is a pattern
              - a pattern-prioritizing brain will make a pattern out of over-prioritization
          - however, some structures can prevent this error, like prioritizing identifying error types, allowing them to occur where useful & using them as an input to learning
            - in this case, a pattern of over-prioritization errors would lead to fewer errors rather than more over-prioritization errors
        - example: 
          - stupidly copying the human brain as a source of structures to implement in algorithms to copy methods of generating solutions also copies the errors of the human brain like bias
          - copying physics structures like efficiencies such as 'rules to filter out info processing error types' can help prevent this error of stupidly copying the brain structure as it is to minimize work of improving the output with structural modifications
            - rules like:
              - 'identifying lack of information or other resources required to solve a problem'
              - 'identifying its own assumptions that may not be constant'
              - 'identifying its own over-prioritization of patterns over meaning'
              - 'identifying its own incentives towards cheaper solutions'
          - for a 'find a prediction function' problem, this could take the form of:
            - identify insufficient info: identifying when a function cant be specified further bc the info available is insufficient to resolve ambiguities in its structure
            - change constant/assumption: identifying when a variable is likely to have corrupt data bc it doesnt follow patterns of any other variable seen across data sets
            - identify over-prioritization of patterns: identifying the patterns in a data set accurately but not identifying the meaning of those patterns (the reason/cause of the pattern is 'researcher injecting bias')
            - identifying incentives prioritizing cheap solutions: identifying & implementing a low-cost solution like regression or Ai without recognizing efficiencies gained from other more expensive solutions that will produce cheaper solutions in future resolutions of this problem type
        - example: 
          - an error in selecting a prediction function will output errors in components depending on it (users of predictions made using the function)
          - this can be offset by weighting the predicting function or using it only according to its known error types (when those error type cases dont apply) or distorting it to handle known error types

        - using error type interaction rules to predict other error types
          - by knowing that 'over-prioritization' is an error type, we can see that 'over-prioritizing constants/assumptions' can generate errors, before a constant or assumption generates an error
          - by knowing that 'cheaper solutions are incentivized (meaning low-cost, even though theyre not necessarily optimal)', we can see that 'assumptions/constants' are a cheap resource and are therefore a possible source of error, before they generate en error (before we see them generate an error)
            - for 'find a prediction function' problem, the assumptions that are cheap error-causing resources may be assumptions of components of the solution or the method used to solve the problem
              - assumptions that data set variables should be primary components of the solution, which is found with a method like regression
              - as opposed to using higher-value components like understanding of:
                - how patterns interact & develop & the cause/reason for them
                  - sufficiently similar patterns may merge into a type or compete for dominance or cooperate for efficiency
                  - patterns develop when there is structural stability to support their development (causal structures are constant enough to rely on so they repeat and form a pattern)
                - how variables interact & develop & the cause/reason for them
                  - how change occurs within a variable to identify corrupt data
                  - how variable types interact
                  - how variable interact (by positional adjacence, input/output connections, similarities)

        - using error type interaction rules to predict solution structures
          - by knowing that 'cheaper solutions are incentivized', we can infer by applying the logic interface that:
            - 'cheap solutions often help fulfill intents optimally' 
              - 'a solution can be composed at least in part from efficiencies like low-cost solutions'
              - 'there may be efficiencies available in the system bc of this rule that will help with any given problem-solving intent'
                - 'bc if its a problem, there is a reason for the intent'
                  - 'so given that an agent will benefit from solving the problem'
                    - 'there is a way to solve it'
                    - 'if there is one way, there are likely other ways'
                    - 'of these other ways, some are more efficient than others'
                    - 'if its a problem, its probably complex'
                      - 'in a complex system, there will be at least some efficiencies'
                        - 'some of these efficiencies may be usable to fulfill the agent intent'

    - example of 'self-defeating' error type: killing their people to protect cultural artifacts that were only meaningful to the people being killed to protect them
      - this is also an example of error types:
        - bias:
          - prioritizing property (buildings, land) over human potential
            - humans can build property and give it meaning or take it away
          - prioritizing similarity 
            - protecting what they can see & what is nearby (similarity in position)
            - working with those who claim similar goals like weapons dealers who claim to be helping them
            - protecting anything similar to or related to themselves rather than empathizing or thinking
            - blaming dissimilar groups (the US & Russia) for their own violence
            - blaming the enemy (Israel & Palestine) for their own violence
            - blaming the past & the dead for their own violence (they did it to avenge someone dead, or bc they had to fulfill their family legacy of the feud, or for 'their ancestors' or 'their people/tribe')
            - blaming the future or people who will be alive in the future (they did it to protect future generations, or their own children, when they primarily put them in danger by maintaining the feud)
          - prioritizing simplicity
            - not thinking about how war benefits war industry market-makers, to figure out that they were tricked into waging war to profit weapons dealers so they could get profits in the form of financial resources, land, power, laws, etc
            - not thinking about impact of decisions, which is to hurt their cause, their claimed priorities, their culture, & themselves
            - not switching strategies when one clearly doesnt work
            - focusing on short-term goals that dont help their cause, like: 
              - 'bombing the correct position'
              - 'dodging bomb'
              - 'being a glorified heroic victim' 
              rather than long-term goals (or short-term goals that help fulfill long-term goals) like:
              - 'building a safe peaceful place for culture to survive/thrive'
              - 'saving money to move to a place where they can have time to think of solutions' 
              - 'manage emotions to make rational decisions by thinking'
              - 'organizing to help both groups understand how to think & come up with solutions'
              - 'come up with good arguments or inventions to convince other side not to fight them'
            - focusing on protecting property bc its simpler to protect an object that can be seen & touched
            - remaining in the one place where they'll almost certainly die a preventable death without fulfilling their goals bc its easier to be a victim & they think theyll be glorified if theyre a victim
          - false perspective of seeing themselves as a set of attributes rather than a dynamic individual capable of something other than defaults
            - seeing themselves as static attributes like an ethnicity, or having static roles like a citizen of a country, a victim
              - seeing themselves as a set of static attributes turns them into a static type (just another fighter destroying themselves in a doomed attempt to beat an enemy who is also just another fighter, rather than an individual)
            - seeing themselves as unable to avoid defaults like 'minimizing cost (by prioritizing similarity/simplicity)' or 'applying biased decision rules'
          - false perspective of prioritizing addressing local recent intents like 'protecting their own people temporarily' or 'dying a local temporary hero' instead of addressing root cause by 'fixing human nature globally'
          - false perspective of meaninglessness, where only meaning is in another dimension
            - meaning is wherever you create it (by creating understanding/science & other useful resources & sharing them so other people can evolve)
          - false perspective of peer pressure (social confirmation) being truth
            - large groups of people are regularly wrong bc theyre just saying whatever feels good rather than what is true & they confuse good feelings with truth so they never evolve past that to develop a brain that can make the truth good (using science, meaning, understanding, potential or another interface)
            - this social confirmation of lies leads to cascades of stupidity
          - false perspective of fighting individuals who are members of an enemy group, rather than fighting mental errors
            - fight mental errors like bias, incorrect perspective/priority, lack of thinking/understanding/information with tools like education in the form of understanding of mental errors & their causes, & information about solutions
          - false perspective of impossibility of fixing a crime (criminals can do useful work to help victims, even if it doesn't completely fix the crime)
          - false perspective of taking assumptions/defaults/current state or current cycle as constant & unchangeable
          - false perspective of ignoring the output/impact/endgame
            - what is their plan if the violence continues and shooting one additional person doesnt fix the violence

        - not analyzing causes that tend to lead to violence
          - violence
          - being physically adjacent to the enemy
          - having weapons
          - provoking the enemy
          - not showing difference from other victims
          - not showing similarities or the potential to be similar to enemies
          - not helping enemy or trying to help in some intentional way
          - not showing potential to think
          - not showing empathy
          - showing too much weakness
          - condemning the enemy (saying everything about their group is negative when it's not, without acknowledging any counterexamples)
        - not focusing on solutions or thinking

    - add to solution automation workflow implementation workflows

      - add to interface query-selection workflows
        - for the 'find a prediction function' problem, which of the following solutions do you select:
          - start by averaging subsets of points or generating functions connecting point subsets and weighting them
          - identify core functions or base functions of prediction functions & apply changes according to function distortion patterns
          - assume that the function should be broken into subsets and that not all the variables are interactive
          - find difference of points from an average, given conceptual definition of the average as a useful prediction tool by definition of probability
          - find other conceptual definitions that apply to the prediction problem & apply them instead of the average
        - these solutions vary on metrics like inputs, side effects, speed, robustness, accuracy, and meaning, which vary on usefulness, so apply solution metric prioritization functions to select a solution
          - usually solutions with a basis on meaning perform better bc theyre powered by understanding, so select these where possible
          - if not possible, select solutions that fulfill more higher-priority metrics
          - if there are no solutions fulfilling more higher-priority metrics, assign a different prioritization scheme and apply that filter
          - otherwise apply other standard system optimization functions, like 'avoid side effects'
          - derive & apply solution metric filters from problem statement, problem space & problem system, & solution usage intent stack

      - add to finding new error types & solution automation workflows in a given problem system

        - map differences to distances in various dimension sets & try every combination of difference reduction
          - differences including legitimate variables, differences between correct/incorrect values of components like intended outputs & required inputs, differences between formats
          - the differences that successfully produce a solution 
            - when reduced are probably errors
            - when added are probably solution automation workflows

        - identify how problems develop to identify components to understand/solve (prevent, reduce, contain, oppose, use) them
          - how does a prediction function problem develop? 
            - when there are many variables interacting & many variable interaction types & random injection points (a problem of complexity)
            - identify & solve the cause of this complexity problem:
              - decomposing variable interactions & how they develop can solve prediction function problems

      - add other problem-solution interaction structures to solution automation workflows

        - example: 
          - 'opposite', 'neutralization', 'completion/interlocking', or 'contradiction' structures are useful for optimizing interactions between problem/solution pairs, where the problem is the difference between them that should be reduced, or the lack of connection between them, or the existence of the problem that needs to be opposed, since 'neutralization' structures are by default coordinating/interactive/completing structures, so a check for problem/solution fit can be skipped
          - 'alternative' structures are useful for problems like 'lack of optimal solutions'

        - identify problem interaction functions
          - primary problem-interaction functions include the following, depending on adjacent problem structures (problem existence, a lack, a lack of time, an incorrect position, a lack of usefulness, a structure to fill, problem difference from solution)
            - identify, prevent, reduce, contain, remove, oppose, use, convert, fill, understand, approximate
          - these can be used as primary interface query intents
            - 'find cause to find preventative solution structures'
            - 'find alternative intents of the problem to find usage solution structures'
          - problem interaction functions are variables of the solution automation workflow
            - problem interface functions can be changed to use a different workflow
          - these problem interaction functions are connecting functions between the primary problem-solving intent which is a general intent of 'solve the problem', primary core functions like 'apply, build, change, derive', problem-solution interaction structures like 'neutralize problem by finding interactive contradicting structure' and solution structures like 'a prediction function' or 'a set of steps to produce a solution for this problem type'

      - solution variable interaction rules as a way of generating/filtering solutions
        - example: 'solution variable reusability tends to contradict solution variable specificity, so avoid solutions with high reusability when a custom/new solution specific to a problem is required'

      - finding alternative solution automation workflow insight paths
        - interface query to find aligning functions like 'reduce differences' (of problem/solution) for functions like 'connect differences' (of problem/solution), given supported function intents for 'reduce' and 'connect' functions, in cases where 'connect' functions are not available or optimal
          - identify 'connect' function inputs
            - requirement that a distance exists that needs to be traversed from origin to target (to solve the general problem intent of 'moving from origin to target')
          - identify cause of problem
            - cause: 'distance between origin & target'
          - identify functions that solve cause of problem & check if they have side effects that maintain the problem or if they solve the problem
            - 'distance-reduction' functions are relevant to solve the cause of this problem (the distance between origin & target)
              - 'reducing' the distance to traverse is one way of implementing the general intent of 'moving from origin to target'
              - 'reducing' the cost of travel is another way of implementingn the general intent of 'moving from origin to target'

      - example of applying different but aligning solution automation workflow interaction rules (connect/reduce) to implement the original workflow ('connect workflow & problem system using interface query')
        - reduce difference between problem/solution by selecting a space where they are adjacent
          - rather than applying 'connect' functions to connect the problem/solution format, apply 'find' to 'system' components to fulfill a related aligning intent of applying 'reduce' to the problem-solution differences, thus reducing the need for 'connect' functions by default

      - example: what does this mean for the 'find a prediction function' problem?
        - 'find a space that reduces differences' implementation workflow could be implemented as follows, connected to the 'to identify difference causes & solutions in each diemnsion set from each dimension change' as a way to connect to general intent of 'find a prediction function'
          - find dimension set where problem/solution are equal
          - change dimension set until problem/solution are increasingly different
            - each dimension change is a possible cause of problem/solution difference
            - find solutions to each difference type in that dimension set

        - dimension sets could include formats like:
          - probability distribution
          - series/sequence or area format
          - adjacent functions
          - function subsets
          - core functions
          - type point sets
          - root sets/patterns of various adjacent functions
          - function patterns

    - ai measures variance of a specific variable structure type
      - example: 
        - an image categorization algorithm measures variance in variable position, in formats where variable position is uncertain, like images
        - apply attributes useful for position-differentiation & position-grouping (like adjacence) to a standard algorithm
          - apply combinations of adjacent data as input to look for features in combinations, rather than standard unit input
        - cause of solution success (why this works):
          - features tend to have position patterns
          - features tend to have relative position patterns
          - a way of measuring relative position is by combining adjacent features

      - make list of variable structure variables measured by algorithms & why they are measured by a network algorithm

    - ai assumptions
      - ai assumes that there is a causal node (indicating a source reason) for a pattern that is relevant to the problem ai is applied for
        - assumes 'if a group is associated with x, there must be a reason for that'
        - there may be a causal node indicating the reason for that (other than bad/missing data), but it may not be relevant to what ai is being applied for
        - example:
          - there may be a reason that a group is associated with higher crime or lower income, but the reason may be relevant to a historical human bias error like 'over-simplification', rather than relevant to the ai usage task of 'determining how members of that group' should be categorized or otherwise allocated resources'
        - ai is not evaluating its own usage intents that it supports, is not adjusting itself for possible usage intents, and is not accounting for assumptions like 'reason for a pattern' (and subsequent assumptions like 'any reason for a pattern is good enough to use that pattern to identify components fitting a pattern') & errors like bias injected into the data
        
      - how to correct this error:
        - apply insights:
          - rather than using any pattern to identify components, use patterns that are generated by reasons that are legitimate for the usage intent
            - rather than using patterns generated by a reason, like a general 'human bias error' or a specific 'over-simplification error',
              - use patterns generated by a legitimate reason for the usage intent like 'determine economic status', patterns such as 'financial credit history' or 'other resource decision-making history', which is a pattern generated by a legitimate reason such as 'prior decision-making patterns are predictive of future decision-making patterns'
          - this applies concepts like 'time' and 'decisions' as more predictive of 'future decisions' or 'an output of prior decisions' (like economic status) than variables used as inputs to human bias errors like race/gender
            - inputs to human bias error can also be inputs to future decisions, but mostly only bc of human bias errors applied to decision-makers, rather than bc of their absolute decision-making patterns in a vacuum (even in the absence of human bias errors like racism/sexism applied to them)
          - identify insight that a particular variable is only applicable in specific contexts
            - race/gender are applicable in a system where race/gender are inputs to decisions subject to human bias errors, and where that system cant change, and where no counterexamples of race/gender being unpredictive can be found
          - identify that if the algorithm uses the variables race/gender just like human bias errors used race/gender variables, the error will continue & the algorithm will either be increasingly less accurate over time, or it will be more accurate only bc it caused its own accuracy (condemned a group so they continued to be condemned)
          - identify insight that input variables to errors like human bias errors are typically overly simple and shouldnt be used in isolation
          - apply concept of 'fairness' to avoid errors like over-simplification bias & variable isolation bias
            - if a pattern is legitimate to use for a usage intent, it will also be fair (using prior financial decisions is fair game to predict future financial decisions)
            - if a pattern is highly predictive for a usage intent, it will also be legitimate (a racist/sexist algorithm wont be highly predictive)
          - identify insight that the algorithm repeatedly making errors anytime an oppressed/weaker group is part of the data set, bc humans commit a bias error of 'allocating costs to oppressed/weak groups bc they cant return the punishment & allocate costs to the allocator'

        - how to derive these insights to correct this error:
          - identify & apply relevant concepts
            - fairness (use relevant components to predict variable)
            - legitimacy (use actual absolute predictive variables, rather than variables that are only predictive bc of context such as errors like bias being applied)
            - usage intent
            - decisions & time are relevant concepts to predict a variable about time-based (future) decisions
          - identify & apply relevant insights
            - variables like human bias errors create other errors
              - avoid common known bias errors (like over-simplification) unless theyre required for a relevant reason (like 'finding bias errors')
            - some variables only apply in specific contexts
              - if a variable (like differences in financial decisions) disappears when its input (human bias error) is removed, its a contextual variable, and therefore wont be predictive
              - absolute factors like definitively relevant variables (decision-making history) are better predictors
          - these concepts & insights are relevant to the usage intent (predict future decisions) & context (human bias error history) by definition
          - the injected concepts & insights in the error are not relevant to the usage intent
            - concepts like 'simplicity' and 'group' are not relevant if applied as 'any position or structure of simplicity' (including over-simplicity in the algorithm, or algorithm inputs like over-simplification error causing biased data) and 'any group' (including groups of race/gender)
            - the subsequent implicit assumption 'any reason is good enough for any usage intent if its above a level of predictive accuracy' of insights like 'patterns exist for a reason' is not relevant, bc 'any reason is good enough' doesnt align with the usage intent

    - over-identifying error, even when it's correctly interpreted as an error
      - simple cost-avoidance isnt an optimal method in some cases, so a cost on its own cant be used as an optimal learning tool in all cases
        - when cost in one benefit-cost definition set is necessary to get required benefits of a different benefit-cost definition
          - example: 
            - it may be a cost to lose a battle (reduce one particular cost), but it may be a necessary cost to win a war (reduce all costs of a type)
            - if I learned every lesson taught by any cost, I would learn not to help anyone other than myself
              - a definition of cost as 'cost to one self or one component or given one cost metric' is too isolated to be useful on its own as an input to evaluate the integrated meaningful cost
              - the definition of cost has to be more complex than one metric, otherwise the lessons learned from these over-simplified costs (and other error structures applied to cost) would be false & lead to other errors
              - losing the battle of 'getting every possible benefit to myself' is a necessary cost to win the war of 'reducing all costs of contextually necessary interactions like trust'
                - if I avoid all possible costs like 'paying a fine when I display trust to criminals', I may learn the very wrong & high-cost lesson of 'avoiding all trusted transactions', bc I will technically be avoiding costs which will seem like success, at the cost of occasionally getting a benefit from trusting someone, which I will never experience if I avoid all costs
              - losing the battle of 'avoiding every possible cost to oneself' is a necessary cost to win the war of 'reducing all costs of selfish cost-avoidance (like inequality)'
                - if every company prioritizes avoiding all costs, it keeps a subset of the population unequal (which is self-defeating, and keeps the cost of equalizing high, requiring granular costs for every specific problems encountered by that population), whereas if they identify that not all costs should be avoided, they can correct the inequality at comparatively lower cost (enabling the population to take care of their own specific problems)
        - 'avoiding all costs' is by definition flawed bc the costs that can be seen by a simple mind that would select such a rule are necessarily incomplete
        - what type of mind would produce a decision to use that rule? one that prioritizes:
          - simplicity
            - simple rules like 'avoid possible costs (risk)' and 'avoid known costs (prior costs or known cost definitions)' or 'avoid costs to yourself or your dependencies'
           - selfishness
           - avoiding being exploited (used at relative/absolute cost to oneself) by a powerful component
        - in some cases, the rule would be optimal to use in those specific cases
          - if all costs are aligned with one cost (if one cost triggers other costs), there's a reason to avoid all costs
          - if a cost being avoided is unnecessary and doesnt serve any other purpose (doesnt benefit anyone), there's a reason to avoid that cost, so a rule to 'avoid all costs' wouldnt produce an error for that cost
            - sometimes the cost not being avoided is unnecessary to not avoid
              - the benefits of not avoiding cost (like 'drawing attention to the negative attributes of exploitation') are unnecessary
              - in this case, the rule is sub-optimal ('avoiding all costs' is now the optimal rule, bc 'not avoiding all costs' is unnecessary & producing no benefit)
        - sometimes optimal learning occurs not being accruing info from costs, but by creating costs for other learning nodes
          - this amounts to teaching other nodes to optimize them so they dont create costs that are unnecessary or sub-optimal in some way
      - how to identify when to use a rule like 'avoid all costs'
        - given the inclusion of 'all', this rule should rarely be applied bc there are few rules that apply in 'all' situations or to 'all' instances of a general component like 'error'
        - identify the above cases where this rule is optimal:
          - when all costs should actually be avoided
            - when any cost can trigger all costs (like if 'any cost you knowingly take on is interpreted as permission for anyone to allocate all costs to you')
          - when simplicity/selfishness/cost-avoidance is useful in the position of a rule
          - when a cost is unnecessary or doesnt benefit anyone so theres no possible reason to take on the cost

      - determine definition of errors (& metrics of costs as inputs to determine an error) for other system contexts/positions to identify the cost meaning (actual integrated cost, rather than cost given one position of an agent in the system) to identify the right error/solution metrics to solve a problem & avoid causing other problems (including avoiding causing problems for other users of the system)

    - determine whether something 'makes sense' using the logic interface:
      - insight: 'deploying a change makes sense if the change increases meaningful benefits or decreases meaningful costs'
      - problem question: 'does reducing inequality reduce or increase costs in general'
        - identify the costs/benefits of reducing inequality 
          - reduces costs:
            - deploying specific solutions as needed after determining where theyre needed (vaccines, military/police funding, & food aid (solve specific problems for other people))
            - debt default costs of unpaid debts
            - insurance/safety net payout costs
          - increases costs (deployment/implementation costs)
            - cost of convincing market participants to implement this strategy & deploying implementation
            - increases/re-allocates costs to temporary one-time costs:
              - reducing pollution
              - educating workers so they can automate their jobs (create efficiencies to reduce global work requirements)
              - increasing wages for lowest paid workers
              - automation of labor to produce/deliver required basic goods to make it relatively cheap to do so
          - reduces benefits:
            - reduces suppliers in the cheapest labor market
          - increases benefits:
            - new suppliers (labor/products/employment, loaners)
            - new demanders (consumers, borrowers)
            - increases cash flow, investment, & trading
            - new self-suppliers of self-demanders (solve their own specific problems, with already available information about what they need)

      - apply 'contradiction' (opposite) filter: should any of these changes from inequality-reduction be avoided for any reason, that are more relevant/important than the reasons to reduce inequality
        - if none found, costs/benefits of the strategy to implement the goal are accurately meaningful, meaning (with relevance to original question) that:
          - 'reducing inequality does reduce costs in general'
          - meaning of this query on the logic interface:
            - it was possible to connect 'reduce inequality' to 'reduce costs in general' using logical connections of the interaction rules of those components (cost, general, inequality, reduce)
              - logical connections use definitions & interaction rules to link components
                - two rules can be directly connected in a sequence without conversion if the output of one rule matches the input to the other
                - two rules can be directly connected without conversion if common components in both rules are equivalent

    - add to solution automation workflow insight paths:

      - derive insight path for implementing a solution automation workflow
        
        - apply possible different structures relevant to functions like 'connect' in solution automation workflow to implement the workflow (implement 'connect problem & solution')
          - logic governs how components can be rigorously & rationally connected (with reasons like 'equivalence indicates a connecting relation, by definition')
            - logic structures can be applied to connect problem/solution components 
          - cause governs how component interactions develop
            - cause structures can be applied to connect problem/solution components
        
        - example insight path for implementation workflow of the solution automation workflow 'connect problem & solution using format structure like a format sequence'
          - apply insight: 'connect components logically by equivalences' to 'connect problem & solution' problem:
            - connect components using definition routes of 'match' or 'fit'
              - match definition routes
                - equivalence (equal components, like matching input/outputs in a function sequence)
                - structural coordination (interacting components)
            - this is the abstract version of 'connect components using equal input/outputs'
            - the reason this works is bc relevance is meaningful, and equivalence is a structure of relevance (rules involving the same component are relevant to each other by default)
            - this is a specific implementation of the insight 'standardize components to connect them (reduce conversion work, or reduce difference)'

      - generate error insights
        - generate structures of components related to solutions/errors
        - filter component structures to find meaningful structures (like insights or solution automation workflows) by applying interface components:
          - insight: 'calculate absolute cost rather than specific cost'
            - applies the definition of meaning ('integrated components', like 'cost for system or agents relative to each other' as opposed to 'cost for agent') or interface ('component definition, integrating view of component from every primary perspective')
          - insight: 'error is the opposite of a solution in a problem system or problem space'
            - applies the definition of solution/error
          - insight: 'check if an error is a solution in another problem system or problem space'
            - applies structural interface components like opposite
              - check if an error can be its opposite component (and check if that context is possible/probable/adjacent/imminent, to evaluate relevance to current problem space/system)
          - insight: 'check if an error is definitely an error'
            - applies the system interface component definition of 'ambiguity'
          - insight: 'check if an error is intended or is bc of a usage intent error'
            - applies the intent interface
          - logic: 'connect components by equivalences'

    - how to identify the killer counterpoint
      - point: 'election fraud claims'
        - counterpoint: you dont think the other party has members?
          - followup points:
            - how are they organizing? why do you even hear about them?
            - who's benefitting from investing massive funding in creating a false illusion, if its all fake?
            - why wouldnt they choose cheaper methods of doing so than an elaborate illusion?
      - identify most extreme false assumption of point by identify causes of the output metric (vote count)
        - the primary/basic false assumption of the point is that the other side doesnt have votes that are comparable in quantity
          - possible causes (inputs) of 'not having similar vote count' include:
            - not going to vote
            - not being able to vote
            - not having members to vote
          - the most extreme false assumption is the most extreme cause of 'not having similar vote count' (that the other side doesnt even have members (input of votes) that are comparable in quantity, let alone votes (output))
      - identify 'incentives', 'side effects of party/member/vote existence & size' as other relevant concepts to generate followup questions

    - we still have to vaccinate the world's poorest bc we kept them poor so they couldn't vaccinate themselves bc when people are poor, there are thousands of things that could kill them, so we have to save them from all of the thousands of things each time which is very expensive, bc we havent helped them build sustainable stabilized markets to trade in, which is cheaper

    - example of injected vs. emerging definition in an algorithm/data
      - example: poetry automation
        - solution metric filters
          - has to be a reason for a distortion from normal connections (distortions like leaving words out, or like 'away it came' is a distortion from how youd normally portray movement, but there isnt a reason for it, such as similarity or relevance to other forms of movement in the verse, such as that the distortion emphasizes another structure to add meaning to it)
          - show rather than tell (gives structures of mysticism rather than just calling it mystical to sound like its indescribable, as in beyond words/structure)
          - compliance with a standard, whether its a standard tone (emotional), style (formal language), structure (syllable count), or usage (cadence)
        - why would AI error out on these filters:
          
          - response of audience is not considered in pattern data (patterns are isolated from responses generated by the whole poem or a particularly evocative subset of the poem)
          
          - structure isnt the only important component
            - structure of the language map query isnt the only important component
            - language structures like syllables/clauses/adjectives/rhymes arent the only important component either
            - language meaning structures like definitions/synonyms are more meaningful but not in isolation 
              - cant just execute simple queries like 'list definitions of interesting words' to make reliably good poetry
              - the structures (like position/connection/repetition) of definitions & other language meaning structures also matters
            - response:
              - language structures have different impact on different audiences, evoking different emotions
            - surprise:
              - attention structures (cadence, repetition, distortions, emphasis) of the poem will be different for different people in different states
              - the element of surprise is crucial for the poem to work in order to make its point effectively by drawing attention to specific connections that are surprising to the audience
            - starting/ending positions of the query are also relevant
            - connections to other structures are also relevant

          - patterns arent the only important component, even sequential patterns
            - it might also miss other patterns (of varying size like patterns of structures like lines or linguistic components, or varying pattern componet, like patterns of patterns/connections/attributes) & position (like skipping a position)
            - even if it copies a pattern of node traversal in a language map, the context might be lost between the two positions on the language map where the query is started
              - the second position might have a different query that is equal to the original position's traversal query, bc the query is guided by incorrect attributes that dont generalize to the second position
                - example:
                  - original position:
                    - "daybreak's lost citizens"
                    - queries:
                      - language component query: possessive noun adjective plural noun
                      - meaning query: 'the dead'
                        - possible related meaning query: 
                          - 'dead from activities in the night, like a war raid'
                  - apply the language component query to another position:
                    - "mountain's missing flowers"
                    - queries:
                      - language component query: possessive noun adjective plural noun (same query)
                      - meaning query: 'damaged environment'
                        - possible related meaning query: 
                          - 'flowers plucked by people to give to another person'
                          - 'environmental damaged exacted by people'
                          - 'natural disaster like lava or storm'
                          - 'lack of flowers from harvest or animals'
                          - 'lack of flowers planted by people to protect environment'
                          - 'too many bees for the number of flowers to sustain them'
                  - the second position has some of the poetry of the first just using the language component pattern, but lacks the gravity in tone, the associations & context of the original bc of the different nodes connected with the pattern
                    - some of these attributes are mimicked by selecting certain nodes to re-generate the original tone & connection patterns ('lost' and 'missing' having similar meanings)

            - patterns might be cut off right where theyre about to make a sequential connection pattern with another pattern
            
            - patterns might only have meaning in particular structures (which may not even need to be in a sequence, because reversing the order might have the same impact), structures which are not preserved by the ai algorithm

            - abstracting & isolating into a pattern leaves out info about context (system interface), which removes the relevance between different components of the verse
            
          - ai has no concept of relevance except the definition (injected by the developer) of adjacence (or the definition of relevance emerging from the algorithm + data) built in to the pattern identification function (like 'isolate sequences that are repeated' or 'isolate sequences of x words')
            - the injected definition of relevance from this algorithm/data is 'sequential connections' or 'sequential repeated/common connections'
            - the emerging definition of relevance depending on the algorithm/data might be 'isolated sequences of x words beginning with subject and having at least one verb + adjective', which is the pattern in the sequential pattern components that might emerge from the data set
          
          - ai doesn't align definitions of meaning between input/output
            - does not self correct its conceptual changes between input/output definitions of meaning
          
          - ai doesn't align definitions of meaning across interfaces or interaction layers
            - whats meaningful in a particular example data point (relevance to another pattern in the data point) or on the structural interface (number of syllables/words in pattern) isnt automatically aligned with whats meaningful for the general intent of 'generating good poetry' for any input data points
          

    - definition of difference
      - default
        - adjacence in value
      - proxy
        - adjacence to interim values
        - adjacence to similar values to the different value
      - subset
        - adjacence to different value type or other attribute value
      - opposite
        - lack of equivalence/similarity attributes
      - connections
        - varying adjacent values (adjacent values of one are different from adjacent values of the other)
        - differences in relative values (above/below threshold, near a constant/other number type)
      - potential
        - possible difference (how different can they be, while retaining original information)
      - structure
        - differences in different formats (as a sequence, function, set of determining points)
      - system
        - differences in different spaces (vectors, dimension sets, network graph)

    - what makes something easy to calculate
      - a solution structure where the solution metric is clearly defined (structural or having other structures of certainty like consistency or inevitability or requirement)
        - checking a path to see if it includes a node twice is clearly defined (it uses the structure of 'node visit counts' in the 'path' solution structure)

    - what makes something difficult to prove
      - where there are ambiguities (lack of certainty/structure/definition) between the input parameters & the output function value
        - ambiguities such as where multiple inputs produce the same output, like how different x-values can produce the same y value on a wave function

    - requirements of a proof (connect a function on the math interface with the logic interface)
      - describes all possible variation in the output in terms of components capable of producing that variation
      - complete set of test cases or representative example test
      - connects components using only logic rules & definitions
        - example: if we have connections 'a is a subset of b', and 'b is a subset of c', then we can derive new connections by applying the definitions of 'subset', 'equal', and 'container' to the components
          - 'a is a subset of c'
          - 'c is a container of b & a'
          - 'b is a container of a'
          - 'b is not equal to a is not equal to c'
        - definitions:
          - container: if a is a subset of b, b contains a
          - subset: if a contains only elements that also appear in b, but b has more elements that dont appear in a, a is a subset of b
          - equal: if a and b have the same elements and no different elements, a is equal to b
        - we've applied the logic of the 'subset-container' connection in the definitions to the subsets a & b, to identify their connected container components (b & c, and c)
        - proofs also have this restriction, in that they can apply definitions/rules to identify connections between components, if the rules specify certain (having certainty attributes like absolute, constant, required, or definitive) connections like equivalence
        - proofs are a combination of rules with certain connections
        - 'proof templates' (structures) can be constructed using connectible/interactive rule sets (applying structures like combinations to core components of a proof like rule sets)
        - you can match input-outputs (like question-proof) using proof templates (connection sequences between question & proof), if there's a proof template that matches the input question & output proof, but you may not know the proof in advance (like if doing combinatorial analysis on functions to see if anything can be proven about the functions)
          - example question: prove that 'a is a subset of c', given rules 'a is a subset of b' and 'b is a subset of c'
          - example proof: 
            - prove: 
              - 'a is a subset of c' = 'a has only elements that appear in c, but c has more'
            - apply definition of 'subset'
              - 'a is a subset of b' = 'a has only elements that appear in b, but b has more'
              - 'b is a subset of c' = 'b has only elements that appear in c, but c has more'
              - 'a is a subset of c' = 'a has only elements that appear in c, but c has more' (arrived at proof using 'subset' definition)
          - proof template:
            - specific template:
              - to prove that an attribute is transitive for a standard case (three input components),
                given example connection rules regarding the component with the attribute (subset) & the component giving it that attribute (set), 
                and given a definition that makes testing for definition fit as simple as a set of basic calculations ('does a only have elements that appear in b', and 'does b have more elements')
                where the connection rules connect two different component pairs in the set of three input components,
                and the proof requirement is to prove that the remaining pair is also connected in the same way,
                apply the definition of the connection rule to the remaining pair to test for definition fit
            - general template:
              - to prove that an attribute applies to all subsets in a set, 
                find a standard case that is extensible to other formats/inputs,
                and apply the definition of the attribute connection rule to all subsets in the set for the standard case
            - if you have inputs like a set of components, and rules connecting a subset of components, and a proof requirement of determining if the same rule can connect the remaining component subsets, these proof templates are applicable

    - false association error
      - just bc one item has both associative & distributive attributes doesn't mean another item with an associative attribute also is distributive
      - it would be incorrect to associate these metadata in the absence of meaning (relevance & context) assessment
        - multiplication can be done in any order bc its the same operation (find the area of the same shape)
        - division cant be done in any order bc the operation is 'apply a standard' where the standard is the base, so when the base changes, the operation changes

    - examine connection between fractals, sequences, averages, origins, multipliers (self, as in power), & circles
      - fractals as a relevant structure for adding sequences of fractions (adding numbers similar to itself on a smaller scale, infinitely) as a way of producing inputs to circles created by transforming a fractal spiral, where the origin is the original number as a base for applying increasingly smaller scales
      - the set of points forming roots of an infinite negative number sequence (roots of unity, rather than roots of any negative integer number) as a way of producing a circle because of their common distance to their average (center) forming the radius
      - lines of equal length having a common average point (center/origin)
      - fractals & infinite sequences as a way of calculating area under a continuous line (increasing small subsets of structures with area calculatable with multiplication of x & y)
      - what continuous line segments would have an area equal to a circle of relevant proportions?

    - mvp should include function that standardizes to math interface first
      - apply a solution automation workflow like a sequential connection between problem & solution:
        - identify isolatable differences between problem & solution
        - map differences to numerical differences (like cosine or other difference)
        - identify conversions that reduce differences in a sequence

      - example with prediction function (using a 'sequential connection' solution automation workflow insight path)
        - identify isolatable differences between problem (data set) and solution (prediction function)
          - data set is a collection of points
          - prediction function is a connection between points
        - map differences to numerical differences (numerize non-numerical data)
        - identify a function to connect a collection of points (reduce differences between points & point-connecting function) - and the format sequence to connect in order to convert points to a function
          - possible format sequences:
            - data set => points => variables => variable operations & structures (like set) => various possible prediction functions => integrated format (like average) of various possible prediction functions => prediction function
            - data set => points => various point-connecting functions (like average/regression) => integrated format (like average) of various point-connecting functions => prediction function        

      - another example with finding the solution to a function:
        - problem 'convert x to y'
          - list differences between x and y
          - list ways to resolve those differences
          - apply solution metric filter: 'is x == y?' or solution metric filter to test for progress (similarity to solution) 'is new x value nearer to y than previous x?'

        - once youve mapped a problem to the math interface, you can query for available functions that resolve the differences between input/output, either all the differences at once, or resolving one subset of differences at a time when applied in the correct subset structure (like sequence, combination, or integration/aggregation structure)

        - example: map a problem like 'generate a poem' to the math interface
          - apply solution metric filters of a successful poem:
            - show vs. tell: does it use structures of meaning or does it use common words that have become meaningless to cheaply evoke a response
              - math interface variable A: how many structures of meaning does it use vs. how many common cheap trick words
            - response: does it have a probable similar emotional response or does it not consider emotional response of audience at all
              - math interface variable B: what is the adjacence value in emotional response 
            - relevance: does it have relevance structures
              - math interface variable C: how many relevance structures does it have, and do these align with (relate to) the intent structure vector
          - some function f(A + B + C) = y poem success
            - now we have to find operations (multipliers, combinations, powers, opposites) of these variables to predict a successful poem
              - then with that prediction function, we can generate or filter poems accurately for solution metric filters

          - or apply an error-prone algorithm and apply distortion function mapping error output to successful output

      - this format connection sequence can be derived by definitions of 'point' and 'line':
        - identify the intents to connect the problem & solution
          - general intent: 'predict y given x'
            - sub-intent: 'convert points into a line'
        - identify the format sequence to implement intents:
          - implement intent 'convert points into a line': connect points to convert them into a line
          - implement intent 'find component to connect them': 'lines' component can be used to connect them
        - solution metric filter: does the line have to connect every point?
          - no but it should be as near as possible to as many as possible points
        - solution metric filter: in what sequence should points be connected?
          - connections should be made in increasing adjacent order, from x origin to highest value of x, unless some points can be connected quickly by skipping points once priority points are identified, like when there's a clear inflection point or maximum/minimum
        - solution metric filter: does the line have to be composed of lines directly connecting one or more points?
          - no because the general intent is predict position of y given x, not to connect the points
        - solution metric filter: can the line be composed of subset/alternate connecting lines, like subset-connecting lines or various average lines?
          - yes, if an integration operation (like average) is applied to create one continuous line (with no angles)
            - why does it have to be continuous & free of angles? it doesnt, but a discrete line set is less likely to occur in real life (isolated variable subsets predicting y for different ranges) which would ignore the pattern interface, but it may be more relevant with missing data or variables

      - how to derive solution metric filters:
        - identify variables of solution once solution format is identified ('point-connecting line')
          - direction
          - prioritization of points
          - inclusion of points
          - point subsets
            - point subset/set approximations
            - point subset-connection methods
          - integration method of subset connections
          - point-connection methods
        - generate solution metric filters by framing solution format variables as questions

      - how to find answers to solution metric filter questions to determine required solution metric filters
        - the answers to the filter questions must align with the intents of the solution ('derive/improve/approximate a prediction function')
          - points can be prioritized according to adjacence to the average or to subsets of other points if clusters are identified, so the function is predictive
          - direction of point connections matters for some point-connection methods (like 'connect each point pair with their own line, in increasing order'), but not others (like 'find important points & connect them, then integrate/average their connections')
          - points can be included based on metrics (like importance in representing other points, or adjacence to average, as a way of adding value to prediction)
          - point subsets can be selected based on representative samples (a predictive subset) or alternatives (alternate predictive subsets) or integrations (subsets to integrate to form an integration structure like aggregate/average)
            - point subset approximations can be used in place of the entire set, just like the data set points can be approximated with a subset
            - point subset connections can be direct (connect each adjacent pair, connect priority points, connect/average point subset-connecting lines), or indirect (use point to determine value of a possible prediction function)
          - integration method of subset connections have varying value in predicting y (average, weighted average, aggregate, connect)
          - point-connection methods have varying value to improving a prediction function

    - finish applying interface components to error structures

      - add to error type structures as a quick solution filter (solution automation workflow)

        - error interaction structures
          - structures (like set/opposite/combination/sequence) of error structures
          - cross-interface structures
            - error structures that are interactive across interfaces
            - structures that form error structures when allowed to interact

        - analyzing errors on a different interaction layer applies the insight 'interaction layer is often a relevant variable (like other important system structures) determining outputs'
        - other variables (including system structures) applied to errors
          - core:
            - components of error structures
          - ambiguity:
            - errors that are equally likely to be solutions (useful functions/attribute structures)
          - default:
            - errors that are defaults are likely to have useful components or be an output of useful components

    - finish attribute structures associated with problems/solutions
      - add to attributes of solutions/problems can be used to identify error types & causes of errors
        - if something is unnecessary (not required), it is likely to produce more errors than something that is required
        - if something is highly variable, it is likelier to produce errors than more constant structures
        - if something is inefficient, it is likelier to produce errors than structures that are efficient
        - if something is not aligned with an interacting structure, it is likelier to produce errors than alignments (mismatches, imbalances, incompleteness)
        - if something is highly connective/interactive, it is likelier to produce errors bc it introduces other error-increasing structures like variability
        - if something is reusable, it is likely to be useful, so it has more attributes of a solution than of a problem

    - add to solution automation workflows
      - identify overlap of problem/solution definitions (when a problem is a solution and vice versa) to identify contexts where a problem should be framed as a solution instead & solution structures should be applied (like solution metrics or insights like causes of why it works for a problem) instead of problem structures (like questions to change/resolve it)
      - identify solution spaces based on problem/solution metadata
        - pre-filter solution space by identifying structures in a system that fulfill general solution metrics (efficiency, reusability, etc & structures like combinations of these) to reduce the solution set to search for specific problems
        - generate/find/derive structures (like combinations) of a solution automation relationship structure (connection, reduction, removal, building) & construct (probable, relevant, useful, adjacent, interactive, efficient) solutions from those, then use as a default solution space to search
          - example: function sequences & state sequences can be used as components of a 'connecting' solution automation workflow that connects origin/target structures

    - identify error structures & components (components like attributes, such as 'error position') by:
      - missing or lower than expected required components (like cost)
        - rarely this might not be an unidentified error if it's just an efficiency
      - error-related or required components in a non-optimized system
        - any structure that is sub-optimal for an intent is a possible error

    - add to determining function interaction structures like sequence
      - for some functions, there are requirements & limits on what other functions they can interact with, in what structures
        - example: for 'compare' and 'standardize' intents, examples of basic interactions are:
          - sequence: standardize, then compare
          - sequence of subset/total: standardize systems components to compare systems
      - the cause of the function sequence requirement for an intent like 'compare to find differences' is that the standardization (when applied first) reduces irrelevant differences, so the relevant differences are clearer & easier to identify
      - the concept of a common base/standard that both objects have is associated with the definition of 'compare', as a way to anchor calculations, to reduce differences in calculations (calculations of difference will be more accurate & easier when the calculation can start from the same position & take the same steps in both objects)
      - the above intents are relevant to functions like compare to improve accuracy of metrics:
        - 'reducing differences in calculations of a function (like compare)'
        - 'reducing irrelevant differences' or 'isolating relevant differences'
      - apply opposite structure
        - if standardization was not applied, an equivalence check could not be reliably executed without using abstractions like input-output patterns or other metadata than mapping the inputs/outputs themselves
      - apply related functions
        - 'equate' is a similar function to 'compare'
          - standardization is a useful function for both equalizing & comparing objects
      
    - add to solution automation workflows

      - apply structures based on their definitions in relation to the definition of a solution/problem or the problem-solving process

        - depending on the solution automation workflow applied, it will involve various functions, like:
          - generate possible solutions & filter
          - break into sub-problems, solve them, & integrate

        - example with a particular solution automation workflow function 'filter':
          - the definition like 'filter' is 'remove items from set based on metric', so functions that support intents like the following sub-functions, which fulfill the 'solution filter' intent (identify if it's a solution or not) can fulfill sub-functions of the 'filter' function definition 'remove items from set based on metric':
            - determining difference
            - determining metric value

        - structures that fulfill the solution automation workflow function, like 'filter':
          - apply opposite structures as a solution filter structure (exclude what a solution is not)
          - apply error structures as a solution filter structure (avoid errors)
          - apply possibility structures as a solution filter structure (exclude impossibilities or improbabilities, include common solutions)

        - structures that fulfill the solution automation workflow function 'solve different problem'
          - apply similar structures as an alternative problem/solution structure or solution base structure (solve alternate similar problem, start from similar origin, base changes on existing solutions)

        - structures that fulfill the solution automation workflow function 'build solution' or 'solve for the components of a solution'
          - apply core structures as a solution subset or solution building structure (build solution from core components or solve subsets (core components) of solution)

    - add to determining relevant components
      - components that are:
        - adjacent in interaction degree/directness
        - controllable
        - low-cost to implement
        - specific to that context
        - required/unique
        - enforcing/robust (no matter what changes you make, it will always have an attribute/function)

    - interface query types can be an alternative to interface query design
      - use patterns of interface query types, parameters (like origin interface & input problem type), & input-output connections to identify query types that are useful for solving specific problem types

    - add to ai tests
      - questions/tasks that are typically framed as unable to be answered by anyone other than a human, like:
        - 'what is the meaning of life'
        - 'find a new system to predict events'
        - 'what will be the next big invention'
        - 'when will the end of the world happen'
      - these are relegated to human philosophy & endeavor bc theyre considered too complex to answer, requiring many contributors over many generations
      - example of how my system would approach these questions:
        - problem: 'find an answer to the question: what is the meaning of life'
          - the answer is 'protecting potential of the universe'
          - an example of an interface query to get to that answer is:
            - standardize problem:
              - 'what is the purpose/intent of life'
              - 'how does it fit into the contextual system in which it develops'
            - alternate queries:
              - apply definition & system interface
                - a definition route of 'life' is the 'ability to change' (learn/adapt)
                - a definition route of 'intent' is what something can be used for
                  - sub-problem: what can life be used for:
                    - all functions of the human brain
                  - apply 'system context' interface to this sub-problem (sub-question, or sub-query)
                    - when a question like 'what can x be used for' or 'what intents does it support' is asked, the intent of the question is often finding the most differentiating intent from other components, rather than listing all intents
                    - the most different intent supported by 'human brain functions' is 'protecting entities with potential who cannot reward them'
                    - the reason this is the most different intent is that its the:
                      - rarest intent
                      - aligns with responsibilities (sources of potential have responsibility & power to protect other sources of potential)
                      - most difficult intent
                      - an intent that requires unlikely conditions, like being taught to prioritize it, or deriving that its the right intent to prioritize, by deriving an ethical system prioritizing it
                      - associated with intelligence, a proxy of potential
              - apply definition & conceptual interface
                - 'meaning' has a structural system definition route 'fit in a system'
                - 'intelligence' is a proxy for 'potential'
                - 'potential is uncertain ability'
                - 'a contradictory component to potential is certain ability or certain inability'
                - 'intelligence is power'
                - 'power' distributes when it's misused (used to preserve itself, at the cost of power distribution)
                - intelligence has functions like:
                  - can change a component to fit into a system (create meaning)
                  - distributes its power bc it can generate power/meaning under any conditions
                  - identifies that:
                    - potential is the rarest & most valuable resource that is a similar input to meaning to intelligence (itself)
                    - protecting sources of potential is top priority
                    - delegation of power is equal to delegation of responsibility
                    - delegating both power & responsibility is more efficient than other methods, as other entities will learn to solve their own problems with help
                    - distributing power in the form of intelligence does not contradict any sources of potential & enables sources of potential
                  - concludes that:
                    - not only is it efficient to distribute intelligence, it is also ethical (does not destroy sources of potential)

    - identify error types quickly

      - apply insight 'related components of a component can cause changes (including sub-optimal changes like errors or improving changes like solutions) in that component bc of interactivity' to problem/solution definitions

        - some error types are caused by errors in other components

          - example: 
            - if a dependency has a vulnerability, all its dependent components might inherit it through usage or inclusion
          - solution:
            - the solution could involve:
              - fixing the other component
              - communicating info to help the component fix itself
            - a general solution could involve:
              - delegating error-type identification to components in positions that can identify error types
          - relevant interface component: 
            - perspectives
              - in a system with optimal component communcation, solutions built/derived/found/identified by other components can prevent error types bc different perspectives of other components can identify errors before the origin component identifies its own errors (applying the concept of 'self-awareness' can also generate this insight)
            - function
              - similar components may be related by position, so they might have similar functionality which can be shared to fix adjacent components

      - interface query to solve the problem of 'finding new error types' or 'finding new ways to find new error types':
        
        - applying core functions to interface components of the problem system (or to related components) can identify error types quickly (and associated solutions)
        - this query can solve the problem of identifying:
          - sub-problems of finding new error types' like:
            - lack of info (about variable interactions/changes)
          - by identifying causes of the sub-problems like:
            - limits of info in specific positions/angles

        - apply interface components to origin system (standard cross-interface query), then apply core functions to those components to run another interface query to:
          - solve the problem of 'identify new error types' for different versions of them (change)
          - solve the problem using a different origin position (build starting from different origin position of components to build with)
          - solve the problem of connecting problem & solution (derive)
          - solve the problem of filtering possible error types (find)

          - example: 'perspective' mapped to a 'driving' problem system can have structures like:
            - 'position' bc its a physical system where differences in 'position' change perspective definition components (like 'visibility' or 'priority')
            - 'role' bc it involves agents where differences in 'role' may change 'focus' or 'priority'
        
        - build: 
          - the intent of 'building an error-free system' (like a sub-system of the origin system) can quickly identify new error types, if using non-standard building functions or other components
        
        - derive: 
          - deriving error types from problem spaces or problematic systems (rather than deriving from core system components or from core error components) can identify error types of a system
        
        - find: 
          - finding difference structures with intents that contradict approved intents can identify error types quickly
          - find interface component variables of the problem system (or versions of it or its compoments produced by 'change' function or other functions, like a 'related system') to identify new error types
            - system:
              - find a system where it's not an error and the cause of the error to fix (or cause of other error types) in the origin system will be a structure of difference between the two systems
                - example: 'bowing' is a social error in some systems - the difference between those systems and a system where it's not an error is a difference in the 'culture' sub-system
                  - error types involved include: 'culture', 'sub-system', 'interaction', 'social interaction'
        
        - change:
          - changing interface component variables of the problem system can identify error types quickly
            - structure: 
               - changing common structures of difference between similar components like instances of a type)
            - perspectives:
              - switching perspectives can identify problematic differences between solution metrics & actual values bc of the info obvious or focused on by another component
                - just like another car may be able to see if a car has a flat tire before the user driving from a perspective of the car with the problem
              - switching perspectives is a way to find error types faster, if the error is adjacent to or equals info that is focused on or obvious to another perspective
              - switching primary interfaces is one way of switching perspectives, but you can also switch variables in the origin system:
                - switch positions of agents or components with info-gathering functions (sensory functions) with a particular focus on info that may be in error
              - calculating the possible errors (like by determining variables that are difficult for the origin component to check, so errors can involve structures of those variables) is a useful process to run before identifying a perspective that can see errors in that set of possible errors
              - how to calculate a perspective that can see a possible error, once a possible error structure is identified
                - find a perspective that interacts with info related to the variables/structures/components of the possible error, by:
                  - intent perspective: focusing on or prioritizing the info
                  - input/specific perspective: using/implementing the info
                  - causal perspective: generating the info
                - construct a perspective that has one of the above attributes/functions as a solution structure, and find existing perspectives that match that perspective
            - intent: 
              - switching intent can find intents that are possible error type causes, for the original component, other components, or the system enabling them to exist
              - example: 'cause error' intent rather than 'solve problem' intent can solve the problem quicker in some cases 
            - change: 
              - change change components like variable types (what's required or default for some components may be intended or optional or not possible for others)
            - cause:
              - switching causes can make a component more robust
              - finding a way to build/execute a function given alternate causes can make the function more robust to changing inputs
              - this can be an error type in some cases
            - abstract:
              - mixing abstractions with specific examples/implementations the problem system can result in a quicker identification of error types
            - definition:
              - switching definitions of error/solution can identify possible error types of other systems that wouldnt define another system's survival as 'success', where their error would be 'failing to destroy another system'
                - this can identify possible error types like 'attack from a system with this definition of error'
      
      - solution success cause: 
        - this works bc some solutions can be used to solve similar problems, so solving for a similar problem instead can be more efficient & find a solution to the original problem
        - applying solution insights like 'solutions may solve similar problems as the origin problem' can find new solution automation workflows
      
      - identifying error types is important for functions like:
        - 'find solutions by avoiding known error types'
        - 'prevent errors'
        - 'identify error interactions, so the interaction of changes to one error & changes in related errors can be predicted'

    - indexing solutions by the 'reason why it worked or didnt work' (solution success/error cause) is a quicker way to select/filter solutions in some cases
      - add the solution success cause (like power or certainty or interactivity) to the solution automation workflow:
        - example: 'apply the definition of power to generate/find power structures to find inputs that can enable this output'
      - if the 'reason why the solution worked' (or its associated 'reason why the problem exists') is present in the problem system, that may help filter solutions more efficiently than other methods like:
        - 'try existing solutions'
          - reason why it may work: 
            - the problem space may not have changed sufficiently or the problem may not be new to invalidate existing solutions
        - 'try adjacent modifications to existing solutions'
          - reasons why it may work: 
            - existing solutions may be similar enough to a working solution that minor modifications (like by adjacent conversions built from core functions) may be sufficient
            - the problem space may not have changed sufficiently or the problem may not be new to invalidate every component of existing solutions
        - 'derive solution requirements from problem statement & filter solutions'
          - reasons why it may work:
            - the problem has enough info to derive sufficient filtering requirements
      - a reason to use a particular solution often relies on structural system components (like similarities/alignments, such as structural similarities or input/output alignments) & other important interface components
        - there is a structural similarity between the above solution & problem, indicating a reason to use it:
          - existing (non-changed) solutions fit with an existing (non-changed) problem space or problem
          - the usage intent may be to reduce cost of solving the problem
        - the more important interface components that exist connecting a solution & problem, it may be likelier that the solution is optimal for that problem
        - a reason to use the solution indicates its optimal in some way for that problem, as in it solves the problem efficiently according to some metric
        - examples
          - opposite structure:
            - an opposite structure connecting a problem & solution may indicate a reason to use a solution, if the problem-solving intent is to negate, reduce, invalidate or destroy the problem, which are structures that relate to 'opposite' structures
              - a problematic structure can be solved with an opposite ('structure-destroy') solution function
            - the usage intent (reason a solution is used, like a solution metric it fulfills, such as 'minimizes cost') is different from the reason why a solution worked (why it was better than other solutions for the solution metrics, such as:
              - 'structural similarity between problem/solution where problem-solving intent was alignment'
              - 'opposite structure between problem/solution where problem-solving intent was neutralization'
      - example:
        - structural reasons why a solution worked
          - info reason
            - bc the solution was the fitting structure to the problem structure
          - system reason
            - bc structural similarities are a useful structure for solving 'fitting' interaction problems
          - direct reason
            - bc the inputs to the solution already existed in the system
          - cause reason
            - bc the solution addressed a root cause of the problem
          - abstract reason
            - bc the solution solves the problem type of the problem

      - components of 'reasons why solutions work for a problem' can be inputs to interface operations (to combine/filter reasons, or build interface queries or solution automation workflows) to:
          - find the reason why a particular reason is relevant to a problem/solution
          - design a reason why a solution should work & then test it
          - derive a reason why a solution worked
          - filter solution automation workflow insight paths

    - application variables of an interface
      - different versions of an interface can be used in place of the entire interface, just like different formats of an interface can be applied instead of the whole interface
      - interface components can be used to generate different applications of an interface
      - speed-optimizing interface applications:
        - core interface application:
          - include core components that can be used to construct other components on the interface
          - also optimizes for 'build' and 'change' intents
        - basic interface application:
          - include standard components of the interface (common components, components on the most-used interaction layer, etc)

    - causative error types of sub-optimal solutions

      - over-simplification error sub-type, relating to interface components/queries

        - one/basic/quick interface-based solution, when multiple are optimal, given the structures (false similarities on that interface) and attributes (complexity) & other components involved
        
        - example of this error type:
          
          - applying the simple version of the pattern interface in isolation, in a complex system that has false similarities on the pattern interface
          - a solution that only identifies patterns (& not other relevant interface components, like errors in pattern-structure mapping) will not identify false similarities where the position of similarities is in the pattern, but not the structures of the pattern implementation, where they should be in order for the pattern to be applied

          - solutions to this error:
            - you can still apply the pattern interface in isolation, if you map other interface components to the pattern interface
            - examples of solutions:
              - map structural, conceptual & system components to the pattern interface, such as 'false similarities', so that conversion to the pattern interface includes identifying 'patterns of false similarities', which would prevent this error type
              - map intent to the problem system before applying the pattern interface
                - query for patterns with associated valid/invalid intents, connecting the inputs/outputs by intent as well as patterns, to determine how different the intents are that a pattern can be associated with
              - query for patterns in errors applying pattern interface components

            - a 'simple' or 'quick' application of the pattern interface would apply an AI algorithm to the problem & consider it solved

          - causal paths/source nodes of this error:
            
            - reason this would be identified as an acceptable solution:
              - reason: 'there are patterns in the data between input/output, so a solution that identifies patterns & converts them into an efficient function is acceptable'
            
            - reason its not an acceptable solution: 
              - reason: 'there are other relevant structures in the system than just patterns between input/output from the data set'
              - other relevant structures include:
                - the above error-related components: 
                  - false similarities, complexity, structures associated with the pattern implementation
                - other causative or interfering variables not in the data set
                  - alternate causes of the data set variables
                  - contradictory emerging or conditional functions that will soon interfere with the data set interactions

    - value isnt created/lost by companies in the timespan of hype/short cycles, so stock market price swings aren't reflective of reality from a macro perspective
      - it takes years to build value, it doesn't happen overnight, excluding almost magical insights that create cascading efficiencies like my system
      - losing value also happens slowly, excluding extreme natural disasters, like the value of a community still being relatively high despite shared losses, bc of social network effects & organization/coordination effects
      - value can be calculated differently, using metadata like the lifetime & total possible value of a product
        - what is the total supply of the product inputs (fossil fuels)
        - what is the usability lifetime
        - what are the costs
        - what are the product intent alternatives (can intents fulfilled by the product be fulfilled by other products)
        - what is purchased with revenue from a product (research, insights, other more valuable resellable products, etc)
        - if this pricing method is applied to fossil fuels, oil companies would be paying people to use them

    - all primary interfaces can act like the problem-solving interface (start solving problem from the concept or structure interface and integrate all info back into that interface & frame the solution in terms of that interface) but the meaning interface (the interface interface) is the most powerful

    - apply an interface as different formats for different intents, like:
      - a filter for cross-interface intents that fit with a filter structure, like mapping inputs/outputs
      - a function network for performing interface operations, like converting/standardizing objects
      - a composition of other interfaces when those interfaces are more adjacent to inputs
      - a convolution when deriving what intents are supported by the interface
      - a subset of paths on a language map when handling agent-formatted queries
      - a map when used as a connecting interface to other interfaces
      - a variable network when describing the interface
      - a query on other interfaces when solving a problem in another interface

    - add to structure finding/selecting rules
      - select a structure that:
        - preserves relevant info
          - input/output variables should have their position preserved bc there are few cases where input/output flag is not relevant
        - isolates differences & combines similarities as needed
          - variable groups should be differentiated from individual variables bc variable groups are on a different interaction level
          - input/output variables should be connected in some way (like constant position or adjacence or connecting path) but should also be clearly isolated, unless interchangeable
        - choose a base that fits & is relevant to data meaning
          - connecting variables based on original position adjacence if no position changes are necessary
          - connecting states in original sequence based on time
        - avoids assigning arbitrary structure
          - distance/position that doesnt indicate info about a function, attribute, or identity

    - question structures (missing info error type)

      - question-predicting rules
        - filter by relevant intents to primary intent to identify probable questions
          - proxies for determining where info is unlikely to be distributed as needed
            - high ambiguity/complexity/specificity/variation or inaccuracy rate
            - info distribution gaps (where info is not distributed due to distribution barriers, lack of intent, or alternative distribution paths)

      - format for 'required questions to info state':
        - structure like a network/sequence/combination of sub-problems, or missing connections between existing/known problem space network nodes, preventing movement from origin to destination on info network
          - movement for an intent requires knowing connections, bc the connections allow navigation/planning of movement on the network oriented toward a goal like the destination info state
      
      - question structures

        - deriving missing connections between relevant components ('how does x relate to y')
          - 'to get output variable y info, you need filter variable x info & variable z info'
          - finding correct position of a component in a structure ('where does x fit in y')
            - 'x is an input to y'
          - deriving usefulness of structures for intents ('is x interactive with y as a possible input')
            - 'x can be an input to y with changes 1-3'
          - deriving reason for a functionn/change ('why does x change y')
            - 'x changes y bc the structure of y is not stable when x is an input'
          - filtering structures for an intent ('what is the best path from x to y for an intent z')
            - 'x as an input to function 1 is the best path to y for intent z'

    - database polling/prompting user for update & predicting updates or searching for & receiving user-approved updates from other services, rather than being a passive receiver of input from user
      - based on local usage/change patterns or integrated usage patterns to identify expected transactions with other services
        - once a credit card is marked as lost in a banking service, a change of credit card numbers is expected by other services which can poll for updates to this flag
          - user option like 'yes, allow other approved databases containing my address poll to collect this update'
        - once a renters insurance policy is changed in an insurance service, a change of address might be expected by other services

    - other structures to use as problem/solution structures

      - these are highly relevant/useful cross-interface structures

        - neutralization structures
          - if a problem's outputs neutralize its functionality, that may not be a problem if the neutralizing outputs can be triggered

        - function structures
          - connecting/conversion/comparison structures

        - understanding structures
          - empathy (as a prediction tool bc its an output of understanding)
          - language (as a structural approximator of meaning)
        
        - sufficient/threshold or partial/subset structures (vs. completely aligning structures)
          - requirement structures
          - similarity (approximation/alternative) structures
            - as not all inaccuracies are errors & some level of error can be acceptable in some cases, structures like similarities, proxies, approximations & aligning/adjacent alternatives can take the place of the original problem/solution structures
            - error types that can be useful for more optimal solutions for a metric
              - false similarity
                - where a sub-optimal method has false similarities with an optimal method (like similarities inputs/outputs of another solution, even though its logic differs and other metadata like the reason why it works differs), but the false similarities are all that matters for a particular metric (like having resources to use the sub-optimal method) and it doesnt create side effects that contradict other methods, it can be a temporary/contextually optimal method
        
        - change/learning inputs
          - standard structures
          - cost structures
            - the patterns of costs/benefits as a way to determine investment structures (what alternatives to invest in, for what cause/reason/intent, to what degree, etc) as a way of determining uncertainty resolution
              - investments (exploring a possibility) are a structure of resolving uncertainty problems, like 'exploring very different strategies until one pays off' as a way to find good solutions when selecting between solutions is ambiguous or other structures of uncertainty like lacking in info
              - when an object 'earns' their resources (does the work necessary to acquire them), theyre likelier to be able to maintain those resources & acquire/generate new ones, so theyre likelier to have those resources, as opposed to random distribution of resources
                - if it's earned it's likelier to be a stable structure (a component of truth) bc everything has a benefit/cost (so when the right investment matches the right costs, its likelier to achieve the goal)
        
        - determining/relevance/causation structures
          - power structures
            - the location & interaction of sources of power (like importance, usefulness, interactivity)

    - apply structures from relevant system (like comedy) to a problem space (like 'correcting behavior' or 'fixing social norm violation')
      - if its a joke that means its by definitio at least partly untrue so is less likely to be a structure of truth & more likely to a structure of a combination of truth/falsehoods
      - surprising
        - different
        - opposite
        - extreme/exaggerated
        - nonsense
          - not incentivized
          - not normal

                - relevance cycle: 
                  - prediction function used to determine discussions, which are used to determine usage, which are an input to prediction function to predict usage
                - function usage makes it better at its usage intent
                  - 'prediction function of usage being used as an input to discussions which are an input to usage, so the function/paper is used more often, and becomes more accurate at predicting usage bc its usage predictions made it used more'
                - relevance in the form of usefulness/efficiency structures:
                  - function output (usage predictions) created a function input (usage)
                - the opposite would be ridiculous self-defeating structures:
                  - function output (high access & site crash from server overload) prevented a function input (using the paper)

            - serious + petty + important: 'none of us can figure out why he tucks in his tie'
              - implies that the problem was so serious that a discussion happened to investigate & research it to fix it
              - implies that no one is allowed to ask him or has the courage to ask him directly, implying he's powerful in some way & cannot be questioned, which implies these are his subordinates who are not doing work in order to discuss this, which implies this could cause their work arrangement to be invalid 
            - 'none of us ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - repeated + important: implies that the discussion was repeated bc it was such an important matter
            - 'none of our lawyers or R&D staff ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - important: adds another level of importance in that they hired an expensive legal team to investigate the matter for liability/indemnity/litigation potential as if it made the company look so bad they had to hire a legal team
            - "the tie-tucking survived ex-girlfriends' interventions"

                - add assumption: assumption that the audience is rooting for the tie-tucking to continue
                - add concept of 'agency': attributing personhood to the tie-tucking, which is fighting for its life against cruel monsters
            - 'even after being accused of being a double-tucker who tucks his tie but not his shirt, he persisted'
              - important + petty + similar: fashion is a petty thing to care about this much, and a special jargon term 'double-tucker' implies a whole community or sub-culture based on or caring about this issue or related issues, which he has caused controversy in, with added importance by association from term 'double-agent', typically reserved for high-stakes situations like foreign wars, as if he's betraying someone or his heritage or group or people who rooted for him, and rhymes with a curse word
            - 'the mysterious tie-tucker left the board of directors'

        - mixed contexts/styles

            - 'his parents couldnt deal with the idea of confrontation so they gently let him lose touch rather than disowning him outright' 
        - adding relevant structures of meaning like:
          - aligning layers like double entendres
            - calling him a 'magician' bc they have a function of 'hiding scarves' which is similar to 'tucking a tie' bc 'tucking' has a related output of 'hiding'
        - defeating the purpose/self-defeating
          - listing all the manipulations youre using, while using them, to the target 
        - false dignity/over-generousity

          - 'he must be doing it to scare away women bc theyre always chasing him'
        - injecting stupidity/extremes
          - he thought it would act like a talisman to protect him from rape or unwanted pregnancy
          - he was told by a foreign holy man (has association with 'wise foreigner' stereotype) that it would protect him from fertility like a 'cosmic condom' (repetition, catchy) 
        - removing a point/agency (its not an intent, he just had the clingiest underwear/reproductive organs known to mankind)
        - fitting with existing systems without obvious contradictions
          - 'using existing phrases in a new way with minimal distortions' is surprising bc its unlikely to find a new distortion of an existing component that someone hasnt tried, so the simpler the better for this type

      - these can be used to filter for other non-comedy problems
        - surprise as a learning/prediction tool
          - structures of surprise & truth are useful insight paths to generate solutions
          - structures of surprise & falsehood are useful solution filters
            - conspiracy theories are so unlikely bc they go against incentives or apply an inefficient connection path
              - why would someone go to all that trouble to do that when its way easier to use this other method
        - structures of disincentives (that go against incentives) can be used to find info hiding spots
        - agent behaviors that are extreme in most ways (extremely dignified, pointless, ineffective) are less likely (uncommon) so theyre a source of surprise/comedy
        - structures of safety/stability can be used as a filter to identify possible/probable interactions

    - add to solution automation workflow

      - generating problem/solution structures in a problem space or a system

      - generating problem structures of a problem space like 'find a function for an intent':
        
        - apply error type definition routes
          - error type: missing component
            - if this error type is relevant to the problem space, that means the component was relevant in some way (like being required)
        
        - apply error type-generating functions
          - error type-generating functions:
            - 'change components'
              - components
                - variable values
                  - inputs
                    - to generate a problem type of 'missing input', apply 'change' function or 'opposite' structure to 'input' structure
                  - attribute values
                   - to generate a problem type of 'missing attribute' (such as an attribute required for a solution metric), apply 'change' function or 'opposite' structure to 'attribute' structure

      - example: identifying structural causes of problem type 'false success info signals': 

        - problem type of 'excess specificity' can create a problem of 'false success info signals'

        - granular/specific solutions are often insufficient, where the granularity can take the form of problem structures:
          
          - handling problematic output instead of input: fixing a specific instance of a problem (an output generated by a problem-generating function call, like a particular position of a problem side effect) instead of all instances of a problem (the problem-generating function)
          - position on a problem network: fixing a problem without regard to other related problems, such as causative problems, adjacent problems, or problems that will replace or re-generate the problem once its fixed/removed
          - specific instance of a type: fixing a specific type of a problem instead of all possible types
          - multiple intents: fixing one particular problematic usage of a function, without fixing other problematic uses of a function
          - lack of unique cause: fixing one cause of a multi-cause problem without fixing other causes
          - artificial constant: assigning one constant value when a variable is required to fix the problem
          - unhandled potential: fixing the problematic function without handling the adjacent problematic function it can be adjacently converted into
          - unhandled context: fixing the problem in a particular problem space context, without handling the adjacent problem space the original problem space is about to become
          - specific state: fixing the problem for a specific state in a data flow rather than all possible states
          - specific success definition: fulfilling one metric when multiple metrics are needed to assess solution success

        - you can generate the above problem structures (like 'multiple intents') for a problem type by:
          
          - applying interface components to the problem type concept of 'specificity' (with general problem type 'excess' applied to this concept for a resulting problem type 'excess specificity') in useful (common/general/interface) problem spaces like 'finding a function'
          - then filtering the resulting structures by which structures would qualify as problems, given the definition routes of the concept of 'problem' (like 'structures that are sub-optimal for some legitimate intent, like fulfilling a particular metric')
          
        - to find specific problem structures of a general problem type, apply other useful problem spaces than 'finding a function' (finding a 'connection' structure)

          - where a 'problem space' can be the context associated with having a problem, like how the problem space of the problem of 'finding a function' is the set of systems where that problem would occur, systems potentially including a network of related problems like 'finding connections' and 'predicting outputs' such as:
          
          - problem spaces specific to an interface:
            - cause: find cause (as an indirect input to a function)
            - structure: find limits/filters of function inputs/logic
            - system: find assumptions of function (as a related input to a function)
          
          - problems applying interface components (like applying 'abstraction' concept to the 'finding a function' problem space to create the abstract version 'finding a structure')
            - apply 'abstraction' concept to the 'finding a function' problem space to create the abstract version
              - problem space: finding/fitting a structure
              - apply intent component & related concepts like 'useful':
                - problem space: finding a useful structure for an intent
              - apply 'abstraction' concept to 'structure' ('definition' is an abstraction of 'structure', just like 'constant' or 'info' are other abstractions of 'structure')
                - problem space: finding a definition
               - apply 'abstraction' to all components until it reaches the 'interface' interaction level
                - find an interface component in a structure ('find a concept like relevance in a structure')
            
            - apply 'interface' interface concepts ('organization' being a related concept of 'structure' & 'interface', just like 'integration' and 'relevance' are related concepts of the 'interface' interface, where concepts related to 'disorder' like 'random' are the opposing concepts of 'organization') to interface components ('structures')
              - organize/randomize structures
            
            - apply abstract core 'info' interface components related to the abstraction of the problem (like problem/solution types, formatted as abstract core functions), instead of a specific problem's ('find connecting function') component interaction structures ('functions connecting input-output')
              - select between solution types (generate/derive/find)
            
            - apply 'combination' structure and 'complete' concept and 'system context' component
              - find all the possible ways to connect two structures & all the info structures necessary to connect them with those methods
            
            - apply 'interaction' concept to 'connection' structure
              - find all the possible structures (like networks) that could convert a 'find a connection between input-output' problem into a 'integrate input-output connection methods with these other structures so they can coexist' problem
                - example: 'find a function' problem can interact with a network of problems, like the 'prevent logic injection' problem, 'prevent execution interruption' problem, etc, so it becomes a problem structure that is not simply finding a connecting path between inputs/outputs but a layered network structure of 'finding the connecting structures, while preventing interfering interactions from this problem network'

    - add to nn

      - youre always using multiple formats in a graph, even when trying to depict one format (a variable network always has core structures & conceptual structures even when it's intent is to depict variable interactions)
        - even a conceptual network has conceptual (and other interface) structures depicted on it that overlap with other structures (like concept nodes & interaction functions)
        - the formats used can be side effects of the primary format, indicating adjacence
        - the reason theyre included by default is bc interfaces are fundamental

      - why cant you just apply a good ai algorithm with probable predictive value to data, once data is standardized to an interface format?
        - example: format data as concepts, and apply an ai algorithm to predict concepts in a data set, or predict concept interactions in a concept set
        - you certainly can, I suggested doing so in my patent for coverage, as it's the obvious existing solution, but only as a short-term sub-optimal solution to connect input/output while the interface logic was being built
        - its also manually applying interface analysi instead of incorporating it into an algorithm
          - by manually applying the definition of a 'concept' to fulfill 'data processing' intents like 'standardization', you are manually applying interface analysis, which is still my invention even if you do it manually
        
        - interfaces have logic specific to them that may be more useful/efficient than an ai algorithm
          - formats have interaction logic specific to them that may not fit with the input/output relationships of a particular algorithm
          - examples:
            - functions/intent/cause/pattern/logic/change have inherent sequential structures that other interfaces dont
              - this is bc they are objects that map inputs/outputs
            - concepts have an inherent tree & net (capturing evolutions of definitions before fully structured) structure that other interfaces dont (concepts capture openings, overlaps, definition evolutions)
              - this is bc the interface object ('concept') is by definition a definition structure (a structure that describes definition structures, like definition routes)
          - an algorithm that applies the more powerful interface interactions & structures inherent to interfaces to quickly identify important variables, group membership, & other important structures would be a better goal than trying to pretend you didnt steal my work
            - the work of 'stealing my work' and 'pretending not to' doesnt produce efficient brains with a good grasp of concepts like 'meaning', so it emerges as an inefficiency bc the type of brains developed wont be good at finding solutions to output problems generated by granularly copying/pasting to a specific problem/solution & hoping it works better
            - 'understanding my work' is a better goal if you cant look away bc youre not done experiencing awe
              - once you understand it, you wont need to watch me work, youll be able to generate my work
        
        - ai automates learning, like identifying structures such as important variables, why cant you use it for everything
          - some learning algorithms are sub-optimal (as in slow, or missing important info) or cant derive the required info (as in limited in possible accuracy achievable) so theyre not fitting for everything & cant derive the missing info
          - interface analysis can automate identifying important variables by applying an interface:
            - to apply interface component definitions
              - like identifying variable structures, such as vertex variables
            - to convert to a format where the data is framed in terms of these structures & has the interaction logic rules applied (like rules governing interactions between variable types, like how a vertex variable is often an input to other variables bc its causative)
        
        - learning method
          - ai applies updates to learning parameters to adjust a function until its a good predictor
          - interface analysis can apply other methods of learning, like applying:
            - error structures to derive a function from opposite structures to those error structures, for intents like 'create an accurate prediction function'
            - vertex structures, which are an interface structure related to 'important variables', for intents like 'identify important variables'
            - organization structures, which are relevant for intents like 'finding the optimal position of a structure in another structure' and 'finding useful structures'
          
          - related intents of ai can have different adjacent algorithms
            - 'create an accurate prediction function' (apply function, base, component, subset, filter & limit structures)
            - 'avoid errors' (apply error structures)
            - 'identify important variables' (apply vertex structures)

          - however the methods for one intent can act as proxies for another related intent

          - how to identify related intents
            - 'avoiding errors' is an intent that coordinate with intents like 'find a connecting function' (like 'find a prediction function')
            - the reason they are related is bc of interface structures (definition, structure, & functionality):
              - definition
                - errors are by definition a component of learning
              - intent
                - the 'prediction' intent is helped by intents like 'learning new info'
              - structure & functionality
                - the inputs/outputs of 'avoid errors of this type (inaccurate prediction types, as inaccuracy/difference types)' and 'find a connecting prediction function' are similar

          - alternative structures to filter function network (other than variable/object/state network)
            - limit network
              - format data in a way that it can be input into a limit network and the limits will perform intents supported by limits:
                - identify it or what it is not
                - find its optimal position
            - combination network
              - network of subsets/combinations of components (like variable subsets/combinations)
                - applying functions to nodes in this network can identify optimal combinations quickly, if functions applied align with outputs (applying the functions produces useful info to determine functionality)
            - mixed network
              - combination of network structures
                - route data to other network structures when its determined by a routing network structure that other structures cant use it (like routing info to another interaction layer, if its a network of interaction layers)
              - network of mixes of structures
                - network of mixes (highly variable combinations) of structures, like a network of cross-interface structures
            - similarity (adjacent/proxy) network
              - replace components with adjacent components for intents like 'find alternatives'
            - difference network
              - a network of difference structures (like extreme, opposite, specific, value, structure, & pattern differences) for intents like 'find alternatives' or 'find interactions between a specific difference set'
            - relevance/irrelevance network (for what contexts & problems would info be useful/useless)
              - system context network
                - systems where info would fit into the system or be useful
                - related contexts & their interactions
                - spaces where info is structural (graphable) or has an attribute like difference structure (difference type/degree)
            - point sets (like threshold values/centers/origins to use as references)
            - cross-interface maps

          - alternate variable set structures
            - isolated aligned variable changes as a map (stack of differences) between types/thresholds

        - structures identified by interface analysis
          
          - learning structures (including by definition variables, types & differences)
            - error/solution structures
              - adjacent (sub-problem, related problem, available/known/possible) error/solution structures
            - guess-answer interaction structures (structures of difference/similarity between very wrong or almost correct guess & actual answer)
              - prediction-answer interaction structures (structures of interaction between informed prediction, uninformed prediction, pattern-informed prediction, etc)
            - question-answer interaction structures (structures of interaction between question, info retrieved by question, difference between info retrieved so far & answer, and the answer)
            - adjacent learning structures
              - change structures are adjacent to learning structures bc learning involves change types (like between initial/interim/final states, inputs/outputs)
            
          - interface structures (intents, concepts, patterns)
            - system structures like incentives, ambiguities, & efficiencies
            - meaning structures (reasons why something worked, how an insight fits in a system, how components can be organized in a useful way, how a structure is relevant for an intent)
          
          - useful interface interaction structures 
            - function sequences with alignment in inputs/outputs
            - core functions as a component for 'build' intents
            - interaction layers (coordinating, competing, contradicting, coexisting & other interaction structures)
            - definition structures
            - change potential
            - conversion adjacence
            - structures of interface interactions (intent-function maps, logic/cause/state networks)

          - core interface interaction structures (apply interface structures to interface structures)
            - to generate core intent structures:
              - apply structure interface: structure intents like direct uses
              - apply concept interface: conceptual intents like priorities
        
        - structures identified by ai
          - type (group membership)
          - difference
          - important variables

        - questions unanswered by ai
          - does the definition of difference make sense for this problem/solution components (algorithm, data, intent)
          - what are the intents (structure intents like direct uses & conceptual intents like priorities) supported by the algorithm/parameters
            - can this algorithm fulfill the intent of connecting the input/output differences in the data
              - is it capable of mapping the inputs/outputs, given the difference structures in the data (difference types, lack of sufficient differentiation, etc)
            - what other intents (like adjacent/contradictory intents to the primary intent) are supported

      - ai has added concepts since its first implementation bc the first implementation (multi-layer perceptron) was not enough & other functions needed to be embedded to optimize for certain tasks
        - which functions/components need to be added for which tasks is still not a solved problem in the ai space, whereas my system does solve that

      - ai has still not derived the concept of an interface & generated its own interface structure to solve a problem, without being fed the definition of an interface, which is an input to my system
        - if ai was the optimal structure, it would have quickly identified the useful components of my system (like trade-offs, exploits, efficiencies, ambiguities, definitions & interfaces) & applied them to solve any problem, but most ai algorithms/parameters cant do even one task with perfect accuracy (or total coverage, like 90% accuracy & an explanation of why it cant achieve higher accuracy - like 'insufficient data')
        - my system can identify when minimal info to solve a problem isnt reached & can generate explanations of its processes (interface queries, which are trajectories on the 'interface' interface)

      - ai depends on insight path algorithms like 'trial & error' to accomplish some tasks like in grid search to find optimal algorithm parameters, but still must be told to do so by a human who has decided that exploring all parameter combinations is needed
        - theyre wrong to think that, they should have come up with my method to filter a solution space using interfaces & solution automation workflows
        - a 'function network' is only useful if a human puts it in the right system & applies it in the right way to solve the problems its optimized for, and retires it when better methods are implemented - the function network doesnt get better at solving all problems just by being fed more problems
        - my system self-optimizes as its given more problems to solve

      - a function network can sometimes be replaced by an object (interface components) or variable network (of interface variables) but ai wouldnt figure this out if it was given a function network as its origin algorithm, bc while learning how to optimize for a particular solution, ai is not evaluating how to optimize its own algorithm, input, & parameters and would need to be instructed to do so
        - then it would encounter error types and it would need to be instructed to identify & handle error types
        - then it would be linked with other models, data, & function networks, and other interaction error types would emerge and it would need to be instructed on how to handle new data, integrate with other function networks for useful agent intents without merging with other function networks (which would remove its connection to the original tasks it solved), help other models avoid new error types while identifying & handling them itself
        - it wouldnt just identify that it should apply concepts like 'meaning' in its integrations with other automation components, it would have to be told to do so & told how to do so
        - a structural definition of 'meaning' is an input to my system, so my system does have methods to handle complex integration/organization tasks bc these are components of meaning

      - ai depends on my system in order to predict error types better, integrate common sense, apply definitions of concepts, etc

      - my system can generate error types & apply different solution automation workflows as needed to solve a problem, and identify the workflow likeliest to be useful before applying it

      - a function network depends on input data, whereas my system depends on problems, definitions, the logic of interface queries, & an internet connection to find new info as it identifies its own need for new info

      - examples of functions that are sub-optimal for a task but get it done (or appear to do so) without immediately invalidating side effects
        - an approximation method isnt as useful as a correct method built on cross-interface understanding
        - attacking a known security vuln by deploying a code fix specific to that vuln doesnt address the problem of identifying/preventing vulns automatically or identifying/preventing hackers from having/using reasons to hack
        - playing whack-a-mole with exploit structures & exploitative agents doesnt address the causative problems of a conflict between agent intents & a lack of coexistence/cooperating/coordination structures
        - paying ransomware hackers as a 'recover lost data' function doesnt address the related problems of risks like that they wont or cant return data or will return it in error (partial/unusable) state & common hacker intents like making money rather than fixing problems and the incentive to move on to next victim or next scam rather than helping victims without ability to enforce data recovery
      
    - what generates understanding? specific interface concepts integrated into the solution, with examples showing understanding (of interface components like interactions/systems in general, & of the problem space), like:
      - abstraction: 
        - handle the problem type 'unhandled problem variants of a problem type' by abstracting the solution
      - intent: 
        - handle the problem type 'conflicting agent intents' by restricting the intent applicability of the solution (what intents are supported by the function)
      - system:
        - handle the problem type 'solution used in different context to enable malicious intents' by applying system context filters to enable applying the solution in specific contexts
      - change: 
        - handle the problem type 'unexpected changes to inputs, logic changes at execution time, or changes applied to change usage of outputs' by enforcing validation of function version, input validation, and validation of output integration with other solutions
      - organization: 
        - handle the problem type 'sub-optimal interaction of solution with other components' by applying simulations of interactions with other components

    - a good solution shows that it was built with understanding of these interface components, including components like:
      - concepts like 'malicious intent', 'organization', 'relevance', 'probability', and 'integration'
      - problem types like 'conflicting incentives' and 'contradictory neutralizing functions' and 'structure vs. flexibility trade-off'
      - system components like 'similarities', 'standards', 'opposite structures', 'interaction layers'
      - function structures like 'useful input-output sequences' & 'core functions'
      - change components like 'vertex variables' and 'adjacence'
      - common/useful structures like 'maps between interfaces'

    - the relevant structures for a problem (like related problem types & structures of those related problem types) should be generated & applied until understanding is reached
      - at this point, once it has understanding, a neural net can solve problems like:
        - why is the user using a neural net to solve this problem
          - example: 
            - why is the user using an AI to solve a problem of differentiating cat/dog photos, if the photos are very clearly separable, meaning the problem doesnt require AI
            - bc the process of using AI is solving a different problem for the user than sorting cat/dog photos, such as different outputs of an AI model, like:
              - time usage: looking busy at work
              - authority: using AI as a source of truth/authority ('the AI said it was true so it must be true')
            - by knowing about system & related system components like 'usage' and 'context' and 'agent', as well as other related interface concepts like 'intent', the AI can infer that AI model outputs (given a definition of AI models) might be the intent of the user
            - alternatively, by knowing that sometimes a problem type of 'different origin/target (like a different cause/reason/intent) is more relevant than the direct/stated origin/target' applies to a context, it can infer that the user has a different origin/target (like a different output of the AI than the AI model itself, or the completion of the task)

    - with regard to using the structure of a filter network as a filter for useful info contributing to a function, other info & info formats are useful & derivable which can be derived with faster means (definitions, bases, subsets, concepts, error types, intents, opposite structures, efficiencies, alternatives)
    
    - nn to derive error types & bias incorporated into other nn data/parameters/algorithms/structures/models

  - visualizing higher dimensions with changes in a network of visualizable variable subsets like:

    - dimension subsets: displaying dimension subsets in groups of sizes that are already visualizable (from 1 - 4 dimensions), where orthogonality is preserved across the network of subsets
    - dimension groups: grouping similar dimensional changes into a change type across a dimension subset, to visualize the change types
    
    - relevant (robust) dimensions
      - dimension invalidations: grouping invalidating/neutralizing change types
      - causative dimensions: just visualizing higher-impact/causal dimensions
      - vertex dimensions: graphing variables as differences from vertex variables
    
    - mapping dimensions: group value sets as other structures like points or networks in a space where change types like 'continuous change' are supported
      - embedded dimensions: dimensions graphed visually using extra dimensions as parameters
      - base dimensions: dimensions standardized to a base and graphed in alignment, like multiple functions on a graph with a common base
      - mapping other dimension metadata: interactions between dimensions units/change types/limits/definitions are graphed
      - abstract dimensions: abstract value structures are graphed ('a point on a line') instead of specific values in a dimension
      - constant dimensions: adjacent limiting constant dimensions are graphed instead of dimensions of change

    - dimension interactions: 
      - interactive dimensions: dimensions that interact are condensed into an input/output of the interaction structure, and input/output dimensions are graphed instead
      - dimension interaction structures: structures of interactions between variables (like direction/circuits/networks) are preserved, where values may be lost
        - dimensional difference: difference between dimensions is graphed instead of different dimensions & values, where dimension values are structures associated with graphed dimension interactions
        - conversion requirements: conversion requirements to a visualizable shape are graphed instead of actual dimensions/values
        - interaction structures between value structures like positions on dimensions when graphed as a standardized shape
          - example: with dimensions formatted as a standardized form like 'lines of equal length, & values as points on these lines', the interaction structure would be the lines connecting the points on the dimension lines, when arranged in any order

  - possible components of a scalable definition include components framed in terms of interactions with other components that can be used with a consistent measurement (like a stable structure) & can also scale (boundaries), rather than framing them in terms that can have different meanings at different parameters (closed, hollow)

  - apply solutions and/or associated error types as a way to derive the origin component type
    - given solutions (with associated error types solved by the solution), derive what problem types existed to trigger the application of the solution (can be constructed from those error types, where error types can cause/build the original problem or address sub-problems of the original problem or related problems)
    - example:
      - given that an agent delegates instead of trying to solve a problem, it is implied that: 
        - 'their previous alternate solution methods have caused error types rather than resolving them'
        - 'delegation has worked for them before'
        - the fact that either of these are likely explanations can be derived with additional information like:
          - their decision patterns
          - adjacent information like:
            - 'having more info about delegation processes'
            - 'more info about alternate solution method error types than delegation error types'
      - given an error type of "delegation problems (like 'misallocation', 'uneven distribution of work', or 'micromanagement')", we can infer that:
        - 'alternate solutions to delegations have been tried'
        - 'delegation was an adjacent solution at the time of solution selection'
        - 'this is a problem not suited to delegation'
        - 'excess work requirements is an origin problem type'

  - why are certain structures of structures more useful
    - bc by definition (of usefulness), they reduce differences between origin & target
    - a 'function that identifies causative ability of a change type (variable)' is by definition useful to solving a problem of 'find causes of dependent variable' bc it connects the component 'cause' of the problem with interim objects like independent variables, which interact with other problem components like 'dependent variable'
    - some structures are more useful in general (rather than for a specific intent) bc the intents they are useful to are themselves more general or more common
    - 'finding structures of alignment' is useful in general bc structures of alignment solve problems of difference/conflict, which are common problem structures
    - useful problem-solving structures can be found by which structures of structures solve common problem structures

  - another useful concept is 'improvement of a problem metric' vs. 'solving a problem'
    - where the problem is that a spectrum metric like accuracy/robustness is not equal to or beyond a correct value, a solution can take the form of improvement
    - 'a component that improves a problem but doesnt solve it' is a useful interim or alternative structure to position as the target, when error/solution types are not structural
    - example: 
      - an approximation function improves a 'missing information about dependent variable y' problem but doesnt solve it (the 'actual prediction function for y' would solve it)
      - a buoy improves a 'drowning' problem but probably doesnt solve it (a 'method of getting to land' would solve it, which the buoy is unlikely to be except in rare contexts or with extreme/distorted/stretched definitions)
      - a 'fitting structure' improves a 'gap' problem but doesnt solve it (a 'method of preventing & correcting gaps' would solve it, like a 'method of preventing slices/knots & other structures that qualify as gap error types')

  - map math terms to problem components as default connecting structures other than core/interface structures
    - cycle: error type of a structure, involving a unique variable subset that can be used to derive the original structure when combined with other unique variable subsets
    - knot: structure with a gap error type where the structure's subset forming the gap allows other subsets of the structure to fill the gap
    - manifold: structure that preserves its error types when a specific set of change types are applied
    - topology: structure connecting subsets & a set, with core components of structural changes having no gap error types (continuous), having:
      - including limits in the form of including subset combinations & subset intersections determining included structures
      - excluding limit error type structure: 'combined/intersecting elements being excluded', or the opposite structure of the limit error type 'non-combined (isolated), non-intersecting (non-common) elements being included'
    - solving a problem by applying filters to the solution space converts the problem into a sorting/set problem structure, applying organization to the definition of the problem & solution so they can be accurately related
    
  - core relationship structure types between problem/solution, by applying core structural relationship structures (relevant to core general abstract-intent functions like apply/find/build/organize/derive)

    - the relevant (meaning core/causative/determining/abstract/invalidating) difference type between the problem/solution can point to an adjacent function to correct the difference
    - example for problem 'too many variables (too much complexity)' and solution 'method of reducing variables without losing accuracy or robustness'
      - a core difference type between problem & solution: variable count
      - a causative difference type: lack of understanding
      - a determining difference type: whether additional variables add accuracy or robustness
      - an abstract difference type: whether these function types (a complex prediction function and a variable reduction function) can interact without additional changes (a variable reduction function can be a generator of a prediction function)
      - an invalidating difference type: whether complex & simple solution types (function types) can both be useful for the same problem

    - core problem-solution relationship types:
      - organize
        - position
          - the solution is the problem components in the right position in a structure (like an object-function or variable network)
        - sequence: 
          - the problem is the solution with a 'sort' applied
      - apply
        - usage (space used vs. allowed by structure)
          - gap: 
            - the problem is the solution with a 'gap' error type corrected
            - the solution is the removal of the problem 
            - the solution resolves the problem of a lack
          - limit
            - the solution is some change applied to the problem that doesnt intersect with a limit or exist on a particular side of the limit
        - change
          - the solution is some structure of change applied to the problem
        - context
          - the solution is some context applied to the problem, so that the problem is not a problem
      - find
        - identify
          - inclusion/exclusion
            - subset/set: (partial/complete)
              - the solution is the problem with a 'filter' applied (a subset of the problem)
              - core structure
                - the solution is the core components of the problem
            - group (combination):
              - the solution is some combination of problem components
          - fit (count/value)
            - reduce/expand
              - the solution is a subset/superset of the problem variables
              - abstract structure:
                - the solution is an example/type of the problem
          - comparison:
            - equal (balance):
              - the solution is some change applied to the problem and/or solution that equates the solution to the problem (as opposed to 'connecting' the problem/solution)
              - connect (path): 
                - solve the problem by connecting the problem & the solution
            - difference structure:
              - the solution is differences between the solution & the problem reduced/expanded or added/removed (as opposed to 'connecting' the problem/solution)
              - opposite: 
                - the problem is the opposite of ('not') the solution
                - the solution is different from error structures
              - invalid
                - the solution is a lack of a valid version of the problem in the problem space (the problem cant exist in the problem space given a definition of 'valid' including validation rules)
              - undefined
                - the solution is a lack of problem definition (the problem is abstract rather than clearly defined, or structural, in the problem space)
              - empty
                - the solution is a lack of the problem (the problem has no possible value in the problem space)
            - similarity (alignment):
              - the solution is some change applied to the problem that convert the problem into a useful component (an alignment with a useful intent)
              - the solution makes the origin position more similar to the target position
              - the solution is some coordinating structure (like a complement) with the problem that converts the problem into a non-problem
      - build/cause:
        - input/output      
          - the solution is some change applied to the problem that produces or is produced by a structure (like an interaction)
          - origin/target structure (sub-structure of input/output)
            - the solution is some change that resolves the difference (reduces distance) between origin/target, connects origin/target, or makes conversion between origin/target trivial
            - the solution is changing the origin or target position/structure so the problem is more solvable or reduced
      - derive
        - abstract reverse input/output direction
          - the solution is the generalized path from an example solution to the problem definition

  - ml explanation of finding coefficients of prediction function by applying distortions to coefficients & ruling out distortions that dont contribute to prediction accuracy
    - can be optimized with reductions like:
      - 'calculating the most different distortions that will reduce possible values the quickest & applying those distortions'

  - add other interfaces to ml problem space (beyond intent interface)
    
    - interface interface
      
      - calculating perspectives (interfaces with intent, including interface components like origin-target differences & important concepts/priorities/filters) of the ml problem/solution space and applying them to generate a structure that applies multiple perspectives, like the:
        - possibility perspective
          - random/corrupted: the possibility that each or a subset of data points is incorrect/corrupted or random
          - incomplete: the possibility that variables are missing
          - distorted/extreme: the possibility that variable ranges are misrepresented by the data
          - conditional functions: the possibility that multiple alternate functions of the input variables apply in different conditions which can be parameterized
        - opposite x intent perspective
          - rather than solving the problem of 'trying to differentiate between categories', solve problem of 'trying to merge categories'
        - opopsite x direction x abstract (type) perspective
          - rather than trying to categorize from image, try to derive image template types from category & definitions
        - difference x pattern perspective
          - apply difference type interaction patterns to augment data to strengthen prediction function
      
      - finding variables enabling the selected perspectives & generating network algorithm/structure from those variables

    - structure interface
      - alignment
        - what alignments exist between ml network algorithms/structures and:
          - problem components like 'uncertainty reduction' intents (networks that have differentiation, missing info derivation, or de-randomizing side effects)
          - boundaries of interacting solution metric requirement structures
    
    - core interface
      - what components of algorithms exist that can be used to construct algorithms on demand
    
    - function interface
      - what input/output interactions exist between ml network structures/config/algorithms that allow for functionality to develop
    
    - cause interface
      - what causal structures (dependencies, direct/unique/ambiguous causation, alternate causes, proxy causes, causal metadata like degree) exist between ml network structures/config/algorithms, such as:
        - input-output sequences where each component causes (builds, leads to, enables, activates/triggers, supplies requirements of subsequent components)
        - core components which can be used to construct a system/object
    
    - concept interface
      - specificity of ml solutions, which can be generalized to handle more cases
        - unsupervised classifiers identify difference type as defined by a distance definition (distance from center/average/nearest neighbor)
          - generalized form:
            - classifier that identifies multiple difference types (differences within variable subsets, distance from other clusters/average/neighbors, etc) to support various intents (like probability of accuracy in identification/differentiation)
        - supervised classifiers identify difference type as defined by difference from labeled training samples
          - generalized form:
            - classifier that identifies multiple differences, within labeled attributes & category/type definitions, between type definitions, and difference patterns between types

  - is a network the best structure for implementing ml?
    - standard: an ANN network has: 
      - causation: direction linking input/output
      - changing parameters, starting from a standard origin: weight distortions
      - solution filters: applied distortion filters to select the distortions that contribute to prediction accuracy
    - alternate: 
      - other networks can be added to handle conditions where alternate functions can be applied
      - a decision network can be applied to determine when decisions are made to switch to an alternate network (where data contributes to prediction accuracy of an alternate function instead of the current one)
    - subset/core: 
      - sub-networks or core network components can be added to handle resolution of subset/core component interactions
      - a decision network can be applied to determine when sub-sets or core component interactions need resolution, like reducing common factors of input variables with standardization
    - combination:
      - integration structures can include a decision network to determine when components should be combined
    - filters:
      - filters or limit structures can be used to reduce what doesnt contribute to prediction accuracy or cant be applied by default (solution cant merge variables from alternate functions)
    
    - the core structure of a network is 'connection', with related structures 'position', 'direction', and 'filters'
      - a problem & solution can be 'connected' using a structure (like a sequence or network) of formats
      - other structural insight paths can be used to derive solutions
        - find solution by applying solution metric structures like structures of a priority
        - find solution by applying core structures available in problem space
        - find solution by applying system structures like ambiguity & incentive
      - these can also be applied to the ml problem space

  - add to reasons why variable or object network (including all terms like a language map, or a subset of relevant terms to the problem) can be insufficient/inefficient, while it can be used as a format to solve problems in general just like vectors can
      - a language map of operators used by a set of functions would have many overlaps & complicated paths between operators, resulting in unclear directions that functions move in or move inputs toward
      - an object network cannot clearly show all the possible object states (or the system contexts producing those object states)
      - the network is an absolute reference structure with static positions of terms/variables/objects, with a definition of difference or interaction applied to the objects to determine position, a position that may not be ideal for making a particular solution path or interaction sub-network clear

      - variable networks may illustrate attributes & direction of cause, but they dont illustrate:
        - why something is true
          - 'structure of an input' may cause a variable like the 'output of an interaction with another structure', but why is that true - bc:
            - structure enforces limits on interaction potential
            - structure allows similarities & alignments between fitting structures to interact
            - structure allows contradictory structures to damage other structures
          - these are system objects that arent displayed in a variable network with an arrow between an input structure & another structure, with an arrow leading to the side effects & other outputs of that interaction
        - you can add other layers to the variable network to show variables on other interfaces like cause to display reasons why something is true, other than a factual variable network displaying known interactions of components of facts, but this makes it not just a variable network, but a stacked/layered variable network, like how a state network has multiple layers and isnt restricted to one network
        - if you illustrate all interface interactions on one network, it might be unusable bc of the density of interactions
          - the above example has many patterns associated with it, many possible intents, many attributes/functions, many adjacent potential interactions & states & other interface objects
          - these objects can be indexed on the same network, but for quick queries, sorting through all of these objects may not be efficient
          - its also not efficient to store possible adjacent states of an object or its many sets of objects that can generate it or be generated by it in the same network
        - an object network is good for showing known interactions between objects, just like a variable network is good for showing known interactions between variables
        - the merging of all these networks is not efficient, for example when displaying an attribute like 'usefulness' 
          - this attribute may be a property of many objects, and it may be a property of structures of objects (like a system of objects)
          - the attribute also has definition routes associated with it
          - these interactions would be inefficient to display on the same network
          - the structure of the attribute definition routes (on a network of standardized concise definition components like concepts on a language network) would require different structures than objects with that attribute as a property
          - the structures of usefulness defined as the attribute's definition routes may not show up exactly the same on an object or other network 
          - a definition route of usefulness may interact with concepts like relevance & alignment, concepts that may not be displayed on a merged network in a clear way that shows the definition route
            - relevance & alignment are fundamental & therefore common concepts/structures that will show up frequently in a variable or other network, in structures that dont align with their definition routes
          - 'alignment' may involve pairs of objects that make up most of the network - showing how 'usefulness' is defined in terms of 'alignment' (connecting 'usefulness' to those pairs of objects indicating alignment structures) will look differently on that network than on the language network of definition routes
          - so a query to find 'alignment' in a merged variable/object network (that includes all interface components) would have to select between the language network version of 'alignment' (definition routes between concepts) and the structures of 'alignment' found on the object/variable network (pairs of objects), which is less efficient and clear than designing an interface query to select these sub-queries beforehand (like 'standardize object network to concepts & match concepts with alignment definition route')
        - a merged network implies that all possible useful info has already been generated & added to the network, whereas interface queries involve operations that can find/derive new info

    - make diagram of absolute reference connections with metadata structures like networks/paths

  - determine core graph variables (definition of adjacence/difference, connectivity, dimensions, info storage methods, interactivity of structures like sequences)

  - crypto as community consensus, where a decision can have value if backed by a community

  - interfaces that are important bc of generative concepts/structures
    - 'core' interface's generative concept 'simplicity' and related attribute 'composability'
    - 'interface' interface's generative concepts 'interactivity' and 'balance' (how does info from each interface integrate or interact to produce meaning, balancing influence of interfaces in a way thats indicates contribution)
    - 'cause' interface's generative concept 'power' (ability to trigger other components)
    - 'concept' interface's generative concepts 'uniqueness' and 'applicability'
    - 'info' interface's generative concept 'stability' producing info
    - 'intent' interface's generative concepts 'functionality' and 'direction' (functionality develops when there's a reason for it to develop, like a direction of change)
    - 'function' interface's generative concept 'connection' (connecting inputs/outputs)
    - 'pattern' interface's generative concepts 'similarity' (powerful patterns are repeated and patterns develop in similar ways, producing similarities across interfaces)
    - 'logic' interface's generative concept 'alignment' (aligning logical connections with info as a supportive foundation)
    - 'change' interface's generative concept 'difference'
    - 'structure' interface's generative concept 'info' (info about other interfaces with potential for structure)
    - 'potential' interface's generative concept 'adjacence' (what is probable is more adjacent)

    - the generative attributes (simplicity, interactivity, balance, power, uniqueness, applicability, stability, functionality, direction, connection, similarity, alignment, difference, info, adjacence) reflect core structures (unit, value, force, direction, equivalence, distance, rate, ratio, input-output, type, dependency, constant)

  - add to useful concepts

    - bitcoin and ai both benefit from integrating the concept of time into existing inventions (tx history, weight updates)
    - what other concepts could be equally powerful if injected into structures of existing inventions
    - why is time (or the structure of sequence) a powerful concept in those problem systems
      - historical info integrated into current & imminent info was a pre-existing gap in relevant info structures of the problem system
      - the usefulness of historical info wasnt identified or wasnt identified as integratable into existing inventions
      - the related concept of:
        - 'connection' could have served as a replacement, indicating relevance of previous info to new or derived info
        - 'position' could have also replaced 'time' or 'sequence', given the relevance of 'position' as a predictor of financial transactions and connecting one info state to another, given data that can access the destination from that origin
      - its also inherently relevant to know how space-times (states) connect (like in a sequence structure) in order to predict adjacent imminent space-times (or states) as imminent members of the sequence

  - structures like origin/destination points, loops, layers, boundaries, & paths for solving problems (like logistical resource allocation, adding variable to a function, or finding search path (sorting))
    - give examples of problems with relevant structures
      - a question/variable/cause pattern
      - a connected function sequence
      - a set of filters & limits

  - how to identify that more normal language is likelier to contain factual statements

    - multiple interrelated reasons, from the insight path
      1. facts often have simpler connections
      2. language patterns have intents
        3. agents apply language patterns to achieve intent
          4. linguistic intents are often to change meaning until its false (out of the full set of intents to 'communicate info')
          5. agent often over-think how to emphasize/reduce language components and it creates unnatural language patterns
          6. agent-changed language (newly created patterns) is rarely more efficient than normal language patterns (inherited patterns)
            7. when it is more efficient, it is quickly adopted until its normal
            8. more efficient language patterns are likelier to be true, bc of the normally simpler connection patterns of facts 
          9. it takes work to make a set of falsehoods or mix of falsehoods & facts seems like a fact, and the work has side effects like lack of normality (sounding unnatural in structure) or simplicity (using fewer resources to connect components)

    - relevant concepts
      - the concept of 'simplicity' interacts with connections 1, 5, 8, & 9
      - the concept of 'normality' interacts with connections 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9

    - these concepts can be used as almost interchangeable alternatives in generating the interface query generating this insight path

    - despite their differing definitions, simplicity & normality are connected by the concept of efficiency, because what is simple often becomes normal because of the efficiency of simplicity, so efficiency can be used as an interchangeable concept of both of these in some cases

    - interface query to generate the insight path to 'derive an attribute to identify facts'
      - apply concept interface
        - identify important concepts (simplicity, efficiency, emphasis, reduction, falsehood, change, connection, pattern, normality, agency) of the problem system of 'identify facts'
        - apply relevant concepts to problem system
          - agents change language to achieve intents
            - apply intent interface by mapping to intents ('change info' for intent of lying, or 'false similarity to fact')
              - connect intents to original relevant concepts
                - connect problem system component derived from intent interface of 'agent-changed language' to concepts of normality & falsehood

  - add to definitions
    - reason as source cause node ('this happened because of this causal factor')
    - intent as target cause node ('this happened because this intent was the goal used as a cause of the agent's decisions')

  - add to causation variables
    - ability to change (if a variable cant be changed, it is less causative for problem-solving intents)

  - add to problem type structures as 'indistinguishable cause'

    - multiple causes of the same variable

      - example: gravity (no agency, just granular intent of 'apply force to relevant objects') can cause an object to fall, just like throwing it down (concept of agency and intent to 'move object down' or 'move object to ground') can cause it to fall

  - add to false similarity examples
    - set of interactions that are unrelated but appear correlated

      - examples
        - system B has an output that is structural similar to outputs of system A
          - interactions of system B that happen at a later time but their interim outputs may have a structural similarity to the outputs of system A
        - system B may cause a similar or equal output to that of system A, for a different intent/reason
          - if the output is used as a metric, they will seem similar or related

      - efficiencies are a reason (source cause node) that structural similarities occur
        - efficient structures follow patterns that may produce similar structural outputs

  - add to connect function examples
    - how to map connections between two systems
      - standardize structures (like sequential structures such as time), standardizing to either system's structures, interim structures, common structures, interface (like system or core) structures, contextual system-containing system's structures, etc
      - abstract to patterns (like type, cause, system structures)
      - conversion functions (like remove, apply, connect, define)

  - map gravity to similarity (in position) as a calculation efficiency, where calculation efficiencies (like how to minimize surface area or how to apply a key to decrypt info) are an input to information
    - gravity between bulk/boundary creating the mapping of equivalent attributes
      - gravity as:
        - the average or highest-weighted path of interacting paths
        - structure of efficiency through organization 
    - definition: 'structure of minimized surface area as a component of 'entanglement' connecting function of two boundary points'
      - reduced mapping (minimized surface area) is a calculation efficiency to determine boundary position
        - this reduced mapping could be used to connect boundary positions (or their components like an attribute)
    - entanglement as an efficiency to handle risk of information destruction or to handle over efficiency (distribute efficiency (in the form of information) across multiple points)
      - use a mapping efficiency to connect distributed info with structural similarities
    - particles lose their adjacence/similarity bias/efficiency inside the black hole
    - "highest-weighted path from point a to b is the most efficient space-time path, which is not always equal to the 'classical physics' space-time path" (find examples of intents that classical physics is not efficient for)
      - is quantum physics using a different definition of efficiency/similarity or is it using another priority (like energy storage vs. energy usage)
      - how do weighted quantum paths interact with the weighted paths of other particles
    - nonlocality/entanglement as a calculation efficiency in the form of the replica trick
    - wormholes as:
      - calculation efficiencies
      - radiation given off of calculation efficiencies, removing information or filters preventing possibilities
      - sequence of a lack of filters preventing possible paths
      - interfaces (connecting standardizing functions)
      - hidden variables/differences (masquerading as similarities)
    - 'replica trick' as:
      - a way of transferring energy stored in sequential repetition (one coin outcome repeated a number of times in a sequence structure) to energy stored in distributed equivalence (two coins having equal outcome)
    - time as:
      - energy store
        - if time exists, it means change is possible, because energy has been organized in a structure that allows change to occur, meaning structures have developed, meaning efficient structures have been found (organization of energy formats)
        - can you attract other spacetimes so theyre adjacent by storing energy in a way that is adjacent to their storage methods

  - give example of deriving formula with definitions of components 

    - problem metadata

      - problem statement (formula to derive):
        - expected value of the random variable f(x) = actual average of distribution

      - definitions of components:

        - average definition: 
          - sum of all values divided by number of values

        - expected value definition: 
          - average of all possible values, weighted by probability of each possible value
          - expectation is linear

        - p(x) probability density 'distribution sample' definition
          - independent & identically distributed values

      - solution statement:
        - independently & identically distributed samples (data points) from a distribution inside the boundary of the area to estimate, divided by the total number of data points in the distribution is a way to fulfill intent 'approximate area inside boundary'

    - definition connections

      - identify 'probability' as a useful concept to map to problem space:
        - because of structural similarity in probability structures & problem definition (proportion)
        - or as a useful method to find a representative subset to avoid trial & error (or combinationatorial) calculation of area

      - connect concepts of core components ('probability', 'average value', 'sample size', 'data points', 'area') using definitions
        - this should produce the concept of 'convergence' as sample size variable is changed & average value approaches actual area

      - definitions of concept interations
        - 'area' is a related concept to 'probability' when:
          - data points are mapped to possible outcomes
          - problem-solving intent is either:
            - general structure: estimate the proportion of a subset relative to a whole
              - specific structure: estimate the probability of a subset of possible outcomes relative to all possible outcomes

    - alternate routes to derive formula

        - apply conceptual structures

          - apply 'opposite' structure
            - probability of being in the area to estimate

                - extreme points
                - evenly distributed points
                - random selection of points would produce a representative sample of points in a bounded area with increasing accuracy given increasing number of points
                  - randomly distributed points are a way around trial & error of all possible points

        - generate counter-arguments (questions) as filters to reduce error types

          - question every decision, with decision defined as 'variable selections that impact future decisions (future variable selections)'

            - variables

              - method of selecting points
                
                - beginner question: 
                  - why not just generate integer or .1 points starting at origin until all possible outcomes have been covered by an even lattice of points
                - beginner answer:
                  - this introduces bias in the form of an anchored starting point & applies unnecessary meaning to the sequence of points added, which means estimates with low number of points would be biased towards the area around the origin graphable with that number of points
                  - this bias represents a structure of certainty, rather than a way of estimating probability, which by definition is uncertain
                - generate beginner question
                  - apply error type "lack of concept of 'probability'" (indicating an uncertainty like a random distribution, rather than a certainty like a constant in the form of an origin)
                - generate beginner answer
                  - generate differences in between structure posited by beginner and actual requirements
                    - meaning assigned to the origin/sequence is unnecessary and even the opposite of what is required (independent samples that are not connected to subsequence samples in the sequence)
                
                - advanced question:
                  - wouldnt this take a lot of data points to converge to the actual mean

        - apply concept of 'probability' to 2d graph problem space to solve the problem of 'estimating 2d scalar multiplication or summing of 2d scalar multiplication' 

          - probability definition route: 
            - observed x outcomes in proportion to all possible outcomes = probability of x outcome

          - applied concept of 'probability' to 2d graph problem space: 
            - subset of 2d structures (points) in proportion to total set of 2d structures (points) = bounded area

              -

    - change variable 'location of power':
      - spotify is welcome to build their own app store with their own phones or team up with their coalition to do so
      - add variable 'time sequence' to 'location of power' change:

    - apply intent filter
      - is spotify's mission nobler than apple's
    - apply system cost-benefit analysis
      - what features were improved bc spotify exists? are those features worth anything or required needs? did they develop those features better than competitors?
      - if spotify is just charging rent on a catalog, are they adding value to the market, so they should be allowed to dictate the market at all?
      - what products/features would apple develop if they didnt have to pay a fine, and what are those features worth, and are those features required?
    - apply logical fallacy filters
      - apply 'hypocrisy' filter
        - apply 'anti-competitive' conceptual definition structures & test if these structures fit the opponent
          - does spotify plan on raising prices at some point or will they keep prices low even if the app store rate holds? are they only keeping prices low to dominate the market & plan on raising prices later? isnt that anti-competitive behavior?
          - if they are so concerned about anti-competitive behavior, why arent they trying to compete by building their own app store? isnt there a risk that the apple app store is sub-optimal and needs to be improved with competition from spotify

            - apply filters of accuracy (to make sure input/output values are within a range that can be fit to the definition of accuracy in the problem space)
          - in other words, because we can measure specificity & accuracy, we can solve problems like 'find an approximation function'

  - example of calculating possible error types

        - causal direction is directly defined to be relevant in the 'connection' definition, which implies an input/output connection, inputs being liked to 'dependency', which is linked to 'cause'

  - integrate objects/.md text with interface implementations

  - apply to structures

    - concept of attention in structures
      - mixed interim high-variation & high-similarity structures tend to maximize attention
    - examine conflating intent & requirement
    - consciousness as choice to move between neural nodes (rather than being directed) required:
      - the development of alternative node paths performing equal/similar functions, requiring:
        - the development of excess resources, delaying required decision time (making immediate decision unnecessary, avoiding a forced decision), requiring:
          - the existence & application of previous efficiencies & functions for alternative evaluation, energy storage, storage-checking, & energy requirement-identifying
      - the cause could be framed as structures such as an 'efficiency stack' or 'energy maintenance functions' or 'alternative options' or 'navigation/motion control' or 'lack of requirement/need'
    
    - examine similarity (alignment/overlap) structures between: 
      - extremely different components (when an error type is an incentive or a function used for other intents) 
        - when the solution format of some problem has similarities to the error type, like when you need randomness so errors generating randomness are a possible function to use for that intent
        - contradictory/opposite components (have some metric in common, with opposite values)

  - finish organizing lists of examples, functions, info objects (insight paths, definitions, questions), components for configuration

    - organize examples

      - label examples so they can be queried more structurally
      - query for logic in examples when implementing functions
      - organize examples of useful structures & questions in index.md
        - identify useful questions in notes
        - check reduced language components for any other useful functions (what terms cant be adjacently, clearly & accurately framed in terms youve defined) for completeness


## examples

  - examine the distortion vector paths that adjacently decompose a data set into a prediction function from a base point/function set

  - give example of mapping to structures & identifying contradictions its safe to ignore for applying a structure

  - example of permuting assumption: "reports of power consumption have to be exact measurements" 
    - a temperature monitor sensitive to a hundredth of a degree might provide similar but non-specific power reporting for important/extreme usage patterns without revealing such specific information as that which could infer exact operations being done, bc the interval of temperature measurements allows for greater variation in calculations that could explain it
  
  - query examples for use cases like:
    - lack of information stored (match problem of type 'information lack' with interface query 'check pattern interface for similar patterns')
    - query problem breakdown & integration diagram
    - calculating various different problem breakdown strategies first before executing normal query-building logic for each
  
  - add examples of system/object/rule/type change patterns
  
  - include example workflows with example problems
    - include example of how to generate other workflows (different starting/ending points & trajectories)

  - example of using set theory in query operations:
    - edges as core organizing/formatting operations (find/apply) & interfaces (connecting/explanatory concepts/functions)

  - diagram with joke types
    - 'annoying when they bring up human rights in a conversation'
      - conversation system context
        - functions
          - change topic 
            - change topic structure (sequence)
              - introduce a topic (first time topic is included in conversation)
          - expected interaction functions
            - criticism of a behavior
              - 'conversation with dictator' system context
                - criticism of power abuse (law violation, specifically human rights violation, which are a related object to dictators)
                  - interpreted as right in the 'conversation with dictator' system context
                    - expected interaction in this context
                      - 'should bring up human rights to a criminal'
            - norms:
              - for low-stakes interactions & interaction errors (manners, annoyance, disrespect)
            - laws: 
              - for high-stake interactions & interaction errors (rights violations)
        - placing a norm (or related objects) in the place where a law (or related objects) would normally go:
          - 'its annoying when someone doesnt let you end the conversation'
            - 'its annoying when someone keeps going on & on about your previous conversations where you ordered deaths of a dissident'
              - 'its annoying when someone keeps going on & on about your previous conversations where you ordered deaths of a dissident for being annoying & then abruptly stops without explanation'
            - 'its rude when someone doesnt let you end a conversation with a laywer interrogating you for war crimes' 

  - diagram for structures of emergence
    - example: 1-1 input/output relationship up an interaction layer, where extra resources that dont dissolve immediately on the higher interaction layer aggregate & form core structures like combinations, where interactions between combinations & sequences have different dynamics than the individual output interacting with other individual outputs
    - emergent functionality/attributes come from interaction structures (sequences & layers)

    - add diagram for intent-matching
    - add structures to diagram: interface overflow (to sub-interfaces), interface foundation
    - diagram for workflow 1: 
      - function to determine relevance filter ('functions', 'required') from a problem_step ('find incentives') for a problem definition, to modify problem_steps with extra functions/attributes ('change_position') to be more specific to the problem definition ('find_incentives_to_change_position') for problem_steps involving 'incentives', so you know to use the function_name to modify the problem step if it's between the type 'functions' and the object searched for 'incentives'
    - add conceptual math interface query diagram
      - use lattice multiplication as standard example, other than core operations (add/multiply mapped to language, concepts like irreversibility/asymmetry mapped to math)
    - interface conversion, matching, starting point selection (applying structure, checking if relevant information is found)
    - diagram to document sub-functions of core functions with distortions

      - should show variables that impact other variables, the change rates of these relationships
      - overall impact should be calculatable from these relationships
      - should show similar movements for correlated variables
      - should show skippable/derivable variables (variables that can be resolved later than they normally are)
      - should show meta forces for overall trends in change rules (direction of combined variable forces)
      - should show limits of measurability & threshold metrics

        - make a system layer diagram for structures to include layers of structures 
          (beyond core structures like curves, to include n-degree structures like a wave, as well as semantic output structures like a key, crossing the layer that generates info structures like an insight, a probability, etc)

    - map variable structures to prediction potential for problem types, given ratio of equivalent alternate signals

    - vertex variable structures
      - quantum physics, prediction/derivation tools, build automation tools, testing tools, learning/adaptation tools, system rules, computation power are all vertex variables of information, since they can generate/derive/find information
        - which structure (sequence, network, set, or cycle) of vertex variables is most efficient

    - core component attributes: identify any missing attributes/functions that cant be reduced further

# content/config

    - import insight history data to identify insight paths (info insight paths like 'lie => joke => distortion => insight', system insight paths like 'three core functions + combine function with this definition + n distortions to nearest hub')
    - define default & core objects necessary for system to function (out of the box, rather than minimal config necessary to derive other system components & assemble)
      - add default functions to solve common problem types
      - alternate utility function implementations have variation potential in the exact operations used to achieve the function intents, but there are requirements in which definitions these functions use because they are inherent to the system. For example, the embodiment may use a specific definition of an attribute (standardized to a set of filters) in order to build the attribute-identification function using a set of filters - but the general attribute definition is still partially determined in its initial version by requirements specified in the documentation, such as a set of core attribute types (input, output, function parameter, abstract, descriptive, identifying, differentiating, variable, constant), the definition of a function, and the definition of conversion functions between standard formats.
    - document time structures (concave time explaining compounding similarities up to a point of maximum concavity, a structure that can separate from the other space-times)
    
    - systematize definitions of info objects, to include analysis that produces relationships of core objects like opposites to their relevant forms (anti-symmetry) in addition to permuted object states (asymmetry), such as an anti-strategy, anti-information, anti-pattern
      - organize certainty (info) vs. uncertainty objects (potential, risk, probability)
      - make doc to store insight paths, counterintuitive functions, hidden costs, counterexamples, phase shift triggers
      - add technicality, synchronization, bias, counterintuition, & certainty objects leading to inevitable collisions
        - error of the collision of compounding forces producing a phase shift
        - lack of attention in one driver and false panic in a second driver leading to a car crash given the bases where their processes originate
      - define alignment on interfaces (compounding, coordinating, parallel, similar, etc)
      - add core info objects (core strategies, core assumptions) so you can make a network of graphs for a system
    - concept analysis:
      - how new concepts (gaps in network rules) evolve once structure is applied to prior concepts 
    - interface analysis:
      - limitations of interfaces & how to derive them
      - how rules develop on stability & how foundations are connected & destroyed
      - explainability as a space limited by derivable attributes from data set & cross-system similarity
      - vertex definition & give examples (as an intersection/combination of interface variables, such as determining/description(compressing)/generative/causative/derivation variables), around which change develops
    - change analysis:
      - generated object change types

      - separate interface analysis logic into implementation/functions (functions dont need unique info)
      - add functions from workflows & analysis (to do list, questions answered, problems solved, interface definition & functions) as files in functions/ folder
        - organize into primary core functions & list sample parameters (like objects to identify for the identify function)
      - integrate rules from diagrams in patent applications to relevant documents
