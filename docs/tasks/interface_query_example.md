- interface queries are structures generated by the program in response to a user request for information, to find/derive/generate information, such as how to connect two information structures/formats

- alternate interface queries

  1. start with standardized problem definition

    - apply solution automation workflow 'vectorize problem': 

      - start with inputs & outputs and connect
      
      - apply function interface
        
        - find functions that have a data set as input and a function as output
          - filter by functions whose outputs are evaluated by a metric, indicating variation in output metric like accuracy
          - filter by functions that are later updated with a lower-dimensional function, indicating the original function was a guess (approximation/prediction function)
          - filter by functions that are associated with a data set used as input to a function that generated the function
          - filter by functions that are tested on variable data sets, indicating the function is a guess that can be optimized
