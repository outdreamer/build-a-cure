      - apply an interface as a standard to another interface:
          - intent / structure interface: assess intent interface by a standard of structure interface (which structures can simplify the intent interface)
      
          - concept-structure traversal (a multi-interface traversal linking the concept & structure interfaces, so a target concept combination/set/path or target structural attribute can be achieved with a combination of filters & limits or functions applied to adjust the structure until it matches the target structural attributes or concepts) 
            - general: - find a structure for a certain intent that matches a conceptual priority (like relevance, organization, robustness, equivalence, or trust) - modify a structure with a certain intent so it matches a conceptual priority (like power or a conceptual structure like power distribution) 
            - specific: - find a structure in the finance space that minimizes trust in transactions - modify a multiplication method to find a method minimizing larger calculations 
          
          - structure-math interface mapping 
            - general: use a multi-interface traversal to map problem structures to math objects to apply math insights to problem structures 
            - specific: if the problem is 'predict the shape of the boundary of an even distribution of change across directions from the same origin' (for problems like 'finding a container needed for an experiment growing microorganisms given the requirement of the same origin and non-overlapping paths', or 'predicting the threshold marker needed for comparing speed metrics'), apply the 'circle' definition route using the 'evenly distributed outward motion' route to infer that the boundary could be circular, with variable advantages depending on problem metadata 
          
          - a question-answer interface traversal 
            - general: frame a question as missing information structured as a source position and a target position on a network, and the answer as the most robust path, the most relevant path for a particular intent & objects related to it, the path that moves the nearest to the target position, or the quickest path that moves in the prioritized direction on the network 
            - specific: - frame a question like 'how to build a filter' as an optimal path-finding problem on the network between some undefined starting component set & the destination filter object - frame a question like 'why would you build a filter' as a adjacent object- finding problem to find objects that can be produced if the filter is the starting point (input) or to find intent directions moved in when you follows paths to build the filter (reasons to build it) or subsequent paths using the filter (other applications of the filter) 
  
      - merge interfaces:
          - function + pattern interface: merge networks of functions & patterns into one standard interface definition (input/output/logic + metadata of both objects)
      
      - expand an interface by another interface:

          - function * pattern interface: 
            function patterns (what patterns are there in functions), pattern functions (what functions generate patterns)
            function pattern functions (what functions generate function patterns), pattern function patterns (what patterns are there in functions that generate patterns)
          - cause * type interface: 
            causal type interface (what types of cause are there), type cause interface (what causes types)
            causal type cause (what causes causal types), type cause type (what types of type causes are there)

      - combine interfaces: 
        - combining the pattern & intent interface with combination type 'group' would produce patterns grouped with intents 
        - combining the pattern & intent interface with combination type 'merge' would produce merged objects containing attributes common to both patterns & intents 
          - function to merge interfaces: 
            - function + pattern interface: merge networks of functions & patterns into one standard interface definition (input/output/logic + metadata of both objects) 
        - combining the pattern & intent interface with combination type 'unify' would produce unified objects like intents distorted by patterns  
      - inject interfaces: 
        - injecting the pattern interface in the intent interface would produce: 
          - intent examples & abstractions (applying the definition of 'pattern' to include specific & abstract patterns) 
      - apply interfaces  
        - applying the pattern interface to the intent interface with would produce intent patterns, intent component patterns (intent function patterns), intent interface related object patterns, etc  
        - function to apply an interface to another interface: 
          - intent / structure interface: assess intent interface by a standard of structure interface (which structures can simplify the intent interface)
        - function to expand an interface by another interface: 
          - function * pattern interface:  
            function patterns (what patterns are there in functions), pattern functions (what functions generate patterns) 
            function pattern functions (what functions generate function patterns), pattern function patterns (what patterns are there in functions that generate patterns) 
          - cause * type interface:  
            causal type interface (what types of cause are there), type cause interface (what causes types) 
            causal type cause (what causes causal types), type cause type (what types of type causes are there)
