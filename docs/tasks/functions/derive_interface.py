''' function to derive an interface definition if not found (step 3 of program flow)

    1. obtaining input information from a program or user (like a data set of possibly related variables, or objects in a relational database) 
    2. retrieving an interface definition 
    3. deriving the interface definition if not found 
    4. determining relevant interfaces or interface structures 
    5. determining an interface query structure to organize relevant interfaces or interface structures 
    6. execute query, checking for information needed after each interface or interface structure traversal 
    7. applying the interface definition to standardize the information to the interface format, which involves: 
    8. integrating output into a structure relevant to the requested intent (on the meaning or interface-interface), which involves applying structure to the output information as designated in the interface query design         

- deriving an interface definition from examples of objects/functions/outputs of that interface or a source of unhandled variation: 
          - 'searching for examples of the interface on other interfaces' 
          - 'aggregating unhandled variance into the new interface as a potential change type formattable on that interface', 
          - 'filtering examples of an interface into core components, which can be used to generate the examples' 
          - 'assuming common core components & patterns for the interface from other interfaces and applying distortion functions until the interface examples can be generated'
