	- Blocking fatty acid oxidation impairs tumor growth and reduces CD47 anti-phagocytosis

- vitamin d 
	- taking this throughout the day is useful for preventing some cancer activity, which needs continuous suppression to be fully treated, otherwise it'll keep coming back at night when your morning vitamin d supplement wears off, or you can take other supplements at night

- increase MTAP by activating 9p21-related genes (p14ARF, p15INK4b and CDKN2A)
	- interactive substances
		- tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A (downregulated by resveratrol)
		- turmeric inhibits MTAP, so avoid turmeric (depending on the cancer type/state, turmeric may be helpful for some cancers and harmful for others)
			- p14ARF is downregulated by p53, so substances that decrease p53 like turmeric may be useful, for increasing p14ARF
	- these genes interact with p53 (by inhibiting mdm2 which promotes p53)
		- Dysregulation of p53 pathway in GBM is mostly due to TP53 mutation, amplification of MDM2, or loss of expression of CDKN2A-p14ARF
		- Both p16INK4a and p14ARF are involved in cell cycle regulation. p14ARF inhibits mdm2, thus promoting p53, which promotes p21 activation, which then binds and inactivates certain cyclin-CDK complexes, which would otherwise promote transcription of genes that would carry the cell through the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle
		- Loss of p14ARF by a homozygous mutation in the CDKN2A (INK4A) gene will lead to elevated levels in mdm2 and, therefore, loss of p53 function and cell cycle control
	- Situated at 9p21 gene cluster region, p14ARF and p15INK4b anti-oncogenes have essential actions in controlling cell growth
	- MTAP loss increases MTA levels and immune checkpoint inhibitor failure in melanoma and urothelial tumors
	- Excess MTA in the TME impairs CD4+ and CD8+ T cells via ADO agonism and PRMT5 inhibition
	- PEG-MTAP delivery to MTAP−/− tumors controls tumor growth dependent of CD8+ T cells
	- MTAP and IO combination therapy is proposed for the treatment of MTAP-deficient cancers
	- Chromosomal region 9p21 containing tumor suppressors CDKN2A/B and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is one of the most frequent genetic deletions in cancer
		- 9p21 loss is correlated with reduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy
		- it is loss of MTAP that leads to reduced TIL density
		- MTAP loss causes accumulation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) both intracellularly and extracellularly and profoundly impairs T cell function via the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and by adenosine receptor agonism
		- Administration of MTA-depleting enzymes reverses this immunosuppressive effect, increasing TILs and drastically impairing tumor growth

- inhibit HMGB1 (glycyrrhizin)
	- High mobility group B1 (HMGB1) has been recognized as a proinflammatory cytokine and more recently, as a proangiogenic factor
	- HMGB1 itself may signal through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and via toll-like receptors, TLR2 and TLR4
	- Activation of these receptors results in the activation of NFkappaB, which induces the upregulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors and inflammation
	- high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1), an alarmin protein released from dying tumor cells, acts as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling
	- inhibiting HMGB1 may reduce cancer progression

	- also inhibit IGF2BP2/IMP2/VICKZ2/p62, (a let-2 inhibitor) as well while increasing let-2, so that let-2 can increase
		- Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IGF2BP2 gene
			- This gene encodes a member of the IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (IMP) family
		- growth hormone increases IMP2, so increasing the growth hormone inhibitor somatostatin is useful to decrease IMP2

- inhibition of cell cycle checkpoint proteins
	- WEE1 inhibitors
		- inhibit WEE1 to synergize with AURKA inhibition and induce cell death
	- PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors (immune checkpoint proteins)
		- the interaction of PD-L1 on the tumor cells with PD-1 on a T-cell reduces T-cell function signals to prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor cells. Use of an inhibitor that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 receptor can prevent the cancer from evading the immune system in this way

- activate Fas, which is required to kill cancer cells
	- inhibit the oncogene KRAS (which inhibits Fas)
		- inhibiting KRAS activates Fas (required for cancel cell death), inhibits PI3K-STAT3 signaling, increases miR-34a, increases T cells in tumors, increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, decreased myeloid infiltration
		- combining an investigational Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor with a KRAS inhibitor or a WEE1 inhibitor was useful in cancer cells with resistance to KRAS inhibition

			- Through its antioxidant properties, lactoferrin can prevent DNA damage, thereby preventing tumor formation in the central nervous system
			- lactoferrin specifically activates the p53 tumor suppressor gene
			- binds to polysialic acid, a tumor surface sugar
			- anticancer activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) has demonstrated anticancer effects, possibly by suppression of phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2)
			- in another experiment done on hamsters, bovine lactoferrin decreased the incidence of oral cancer by 50%
			- has multiple mechanisms including: cell membrane disruption, apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, and cell immunoreaction
			- also has high bioavailability after oral administration, high selectivity toward cancer cells, and a wide range of molecular targets controlling tumor proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and metastasization
			- it is able to promote or inhibit cell proliferation and migration depending on whether it acts upon normal or cancerous cells, respectively
			- it can prevent development or inhibit cancer growth by boosting adaptive immune response
	- inhibit BRAT1 cancer protein
		- Curcusones are compounds that come from a shrub named Jatropha curcas
			- curcusone D is extremely effective at shutting down cancer cells
			- BRAT1 protein regulates DNA damage response and DNA repair in cancer cells
			- BRAT1 encodes BRCA1-associated ATM activator 1 protein, thought to play a role in the DNA damage pathway regulated by BRCA1 and ATM
			- curcusone D damages cancer cells' DNA and keeps them from repairing it, thereby stopping cancer cells from growing and stopping their migration and therefore also metastasis
	- inhibit carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) cancer protein 
		- saccharin and acesulfame potassium
			- ACE K is more selective than saccharin
			- ACE K completely fills the CA IX binding site and binds directly to a catalytic zinc ion

- inhibit aneuploidy
	- when cell division goes wrong, it can lead to the creation of new cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy, which is found in some tumors

- increase enzymes that regulate cell division
	- increase TTLL11
		- tubulin tyrosine ligase like 11 (TTLL11) is an enzyme that specifically modifies the spindle microtubules by adding glutamate chains to the surface of the microtubule (polyglutamylation), which defines the dynamism and stability of the spindle microtubules, which in turn protects against chromosome segregation errors (chromosomal instability)
		- without TTLL11, cells were much more likely to undergo chromosome segregation errors
		- Microtubules need to establish stable connections with the chromosomes to align them and pull them apart, but these connections also need to be flexible enough to be corrected on time to avoid any errors during segregation. 
		- Microtubules in cancer cells have low levels of TTLL11, making them too stable, thereby favoring the segregation of chromosomes in the presence of attachment errors that will result in aneuploid cells

- prevent mutations that can cause cancer in higher amounts
	- hematopoietic stem cells that reside in the bone marrow and give rise to all of the body's different blood cells gradually acquire mutations in their DNA
	- Most of these mutations have no effect, but some can enhance a particular stem cell's ability to survive and proliferate, resulting in large numbers of blood cells that carry the same mutation
	- prevent aging-related mutations with substances like senolytics
	- prevent specific mutations like Dnmt3a mutations which can cause clonal hematopoiesis (repeated mutation in blood cells leading to cancer)

- inhibit STING pathway, associated with a negative immune response
	- STING1 gene makes a protein called STING that activates an inflammatory response when it detects foreign DNA molecules in the cytoplasm
	   		- STING pathway triggers a strong inflammatory response that protects the body from foreign and unhealthy cells. But prolonged activation of the same pathway leads to a desensitization and ultimately to a "rewiring" of cellular signaling, which aids and abets cancer's spread, the researchers found.
	- long-term activation of the STING pathway leads to changes in cellular signaling that attracts cells that suppress the immune response to the area in and around the tumor
	- chromosomal instability (frequency at which chromosome segregation errors occur) is an important driver of cancer's ability to spread
	- cooperation between cancer cells with chromosomal instability and immune cells is driven by STING
	- treating a fibroblast with a STING agonist creates a strong initial immune response, after which the cells become desensitized to this pro-inflammatory pathway very quickly, and started to signal stress response pathways that dampened the immune response, thus having the opposite effect
	- low chromosomal instability or where STING had been depleted from cancer cells, they trigger a different response - a strong immune response that attacked the cancer cells
	- activating STING in these patients isn't very effective because most patients' cells are already desensitized to it, due to the persistent activation of the pathway from chromosomal instability, so these patients may actually benefit from STING inhibition
	- the subset of patients whose tumors can still mount a strong response to STING activation could be better candidates for STING agonists
	- Treatment of study mice with STING inhibitors reduced chromosomal instability-driven metastasis in melanoma, breast, and colorectal cancer models

			- bacillus subtilis, white ginseng, ahcc, cordyceps, maitake, beta glucans, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus zeae, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum
		- avoid IL-12 inhibitors
			- chlorella, vitamin d/e, turmeric, NAC/glutathione, corticosteroids, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, and calcium phosphate
	  	- avoid IL-25 inhibitors like sitosterol

	- increase TH1
		- berberine, broccoli, ginger, chinese skullcap

	- inhibit TLR4 (a receptor in an inflammatory signaling pathway)
		- sulforaphane
			- relatedly, NAC reversed these effects of sulforaphane
		- turmeric
		   	- inhibits tumor markers that can be causes of cancer (vimentin/PCNA)

	- inhibit vimentin
	    - withaferin A (ashwagandha) inhibits vimentin

	- inhibit CCND1 (a proliferation associated gene)
		- Stephania tetrandra S. Moore/Tetrandrine
		- methyl jasmonate
	
- reduce prenylation
	- reduce DNA prenylation of useful genes
		- atorvastatin

- suppress factors that are upregulated in cancer
	- suppress expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM)
		- kencur (Kaempferia galanga)
			- main component of KGE is ethyl p-methoxycinnamate (EMC)
			- EMC suppressed cancer cell proliferation by inducing downregulation of cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21
			- EMC decreased the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) but did not significantly change mitochondrial DNA copy number and membrane potential
			- Phosphorylation at Ser62 of c-Myc, a transcription factor of TFAM, was decreased by EMC treatment, which might be due to the suppression of H-ras expression

- inhibit glycogen phosphorylase/glycogenolysis
	- Chinese skullcap

- related treatment targets
	- lower purines
		- impaired purine metabolism is associated with the progression of cancer
	- lower oxalates
		- chronic exposure of cells to oxalate promotes the transformation of cells from normal to tumor cells, inducing the expression of a proto-oncogen as c-fos
	- increase MAO-A
		- Monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors have been shown to decrease the progression of glioblastoma (GBM) and other cancers
	- avoiding unnecessary medications (treat conditions like acidosis that lead to gout and lower purines in diet, rather than using allopurinol)
		- allopurinol also blocks the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine, xanthine (released from dead cancer cells) leading to their accumulation in the body
	- lower cholesterol
		- high/low cholesterol is associated with increased risk of cancer
	- increase insulin sensitivity/treat diabetes
		- PI3Ks relate to the sensitivity of cancer tumors to insulin and IGF1, and in calorie restriction
	- reduce nitric oxide/hydrogen sulfide
		- Hydrogen sulfide and nitric oxide are mutually dependent in the regulation of angiogenesis and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation
		- hydrogen sulfide, produced by cystathionine-β-synthase, stimulates bioenergetics, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis in colon cancer
