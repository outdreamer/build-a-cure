- Epigenetic anticancer strategies (as opposed to genetic strategies, as epigenetic changes can also cause cancer on their own)
	
	- https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-05-cancer-reversible-molecular.html

	- Different cells in tumor tissues exhibit variable epigenetic modification patterns throughout the genome or at individual genes; this suggests that there is epigenetic heterogeneity at the cellular level [67]. The reversibility of abnormal DNA methylation and acetylation patterns is a common target of cancer treatment. Many small-molecule inhibitors targeting chromatin- and histone-modifying enzymes to reverse epigenetic alterations in tumors and restore the normal epigenetic state are successful as cancer therapeutics in clinical trials (Table 1). The therapeutic effect is variable in solid tumors owing to the lack of biomarker-driven targeted therapies, which leads to a highly heterogeneous response. The clinical benefits of epigenetic monotherapy remain unknown; however, our understanding of tumor epigenetic regulation has expanded, leading to progress in the analysis of epigenetic therapies in clinical trials.

		- DNMT Inhibitors
			Aberrant inherited DNA methylation and gene silencing accumulates in cancer cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of DNA methylation were developed to reverse epigenetic changes via DNMT inhibition. Azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) are the first clinically used DNMT inhibitors (DNMTis) that have been approved by the FDA to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) [68, 69]. These two azanucleosides contain a nitrogen at the C-5 position of their pyrimidine ring that blocks the catalytic activity of DNMTs, resulting in DNMT1 degradation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, and facilitating the re-expression of tumor previously silenced by DNA methylation [70]. These inhibitors lead to the preferential upregulation of genes with promoter DNA methylation and exhibit high targeting selectivity in cancer cells.

			AZA is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms [71]. Meanwhile, DAC performs well in first-line and salvage therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that have a poor prognosis and are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy [72]. Additionally, CP-4200 and SGI-110 are respective analogs of AZA and DAC that exhibit potential DNMT inhibitory activity in AML [73, 74]. MG98 is a promising human DNMT1 antisense inhibitor that does not require incorporation into DNA since it downregulates DNMT1 expression and cancer cell proliferation by reducing the cellular mRNA concentration in a dose-dependent manner in renal cell carcinoma [75]. Moreover, nanaomycin A has a selective inhibitory effect on DNMT3B and antiproliferative effects in hepatocellular carcinoma [76]. The antitumor efficacy and characteristics of these inhibitors define DNMT drivers and potential targets in cancer.

		- HDAC inhibitors
			Cancer often exhibits abnormal acetylation modifications that can lead to the silencing of key tumor suppressor genes [77]. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) can block HDAC deacetylase activity. This restores cellular acetylation homeostasis and results in unrestricted HAT activity. This leads to increased gene transcription and ultimately triggers a series of biological responses to hinder tumor cell growth or survival, including chromatin remodeling, tumor suppressor gene transcription, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. In particular, the main mechanism of HDACis is the activation of intrinsic apoptosis pathways [78]. HDACis selectively target tumor cells in preclinical studies. This results in the approval of several drugs to treat certain hematologic malignancies.

			HDACis highlight treatment stratification in solid tumors. For example, non-YAP1-driven small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain tumors with IDH1/2 mutations represent cancer subsets that are suitable for HDAC-targeted therapy [79]. HDACis are divided into selective and nonselective inhibitors according to target selection. The most widely studied and commonly used are non-selective HDACis. Vorinostat (SAHA) and romidepsin (depsipeptide) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) [80, 81], whereas belinostat (Beleodaq/PXD101) and panobinostat (LBH-589) have been approved for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM), respectively [82, 83]. The emergence of selective HDACis provides a reliable tool to resolve the function of HDAC subtypes, and a safer and more effective option than broad-spectrum HDACis. Trichostatin A (TSA) is an inhibitor of class I and II HDACs with noncompetitive effects and potent dose-dependent antitumor activity against breast cancer [84]. Notably, tubacin is a specific selective HDACi of class IIb that can increase the extracellular release of CD133+ extracellular vesicles (a cancer stem cell marker) in human FEMX-I metastatic melanoma and Caco-2 colorectal carcinoma cells [85]. MC1568 and MC1575 are derivatives of arylyl-pyrrole-hydroxyamide that are selective for class IIa HDAC and HDAC6, respectively, and exhibit antiproliferative effects in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells [86] and human melanoma cells [87]. Moreover, the HDAC6-selective inhibitor ricolinostat (ACY-1215) significantly inhibits GBM cell growth [88]. Meanwhile, newly developed HDACis shows promising prospects for tumor diagnosis and treatment. For example, IN-2001 exhibits potential antitumor activity in human breast cancer cells [89], whereas AR-42 demonstrates potential in the diagnosis and treatment of meningiomas. Moreover, givinostat (ITF2357) exerts antitumor activity and selectively kills cancer cells in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [90, 91]. Collectively, HDACis show considerable value in the diagnosis and treatment of various cancers.

		- BET family inhibitors
			Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, including BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT can recognize lysine acetylation that is closely associated with DNA replication, DNA damage repair, chromosomal remodeling, and oncogene transcription. Each BET family member contains two tandem N-terminal bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) and an extra C-terminal domain that functions as a key epigenetic reader of oncogenic networks in various cancers [92]. BRD4 is considered a universal transcriptional regulator with enrichment on super-enhancers that drive the expression of cancer-specific genes [93]. Meanwhile, BET inhibitors are a new generation of selective anticancer drug that interfere with transcriptional initiation and elongation by blocking BET functions. BET inhibitors displace BRD4 from the regulatory region to inhibit gene expression, and the antitumor efficacy of BET family inhibitors is particularly promising for cancers with increased expression of oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-Myc.

			BRD4 contributes to the maintenance of c-Myc expression to promote the abnormal self-renewal of AML cells [94]. Meanwhile, JQ1 is a prototype BRD4 inhibitor with proven therapeutic benefits in MM [94], AML [95], diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [96], prostate cancer [97], and breast cancer [98]. OTX015 (MK-8628) is a first-in-class BRD2/3/4 inhibitor that inhibits cell proliferation in hematological malignancies and neuroblastoma, and downregulates the expression of c-Myc, MYCN, and other oncogenes associated with super-enhancers [99, 100]. Furthermore, MS645 is a bivalent BRD4 inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells by blocking the binding of BRD4 to MED1 and YY1 transcription factors [101]. ABBV-075 is a novel BET inhibitor that triggers apoptosis in AML cells, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and MM cells [102], whereas ABBV-744 selectively targets the BD2 domain, displaces BRD4 from androgen receptor (AR)-containing super-enhancers, and inhibits AR-dependent transcription. This shows better antitumor activity than ABBV-075 in a mouse xenograft model using human prostate cancer cells [103]. CC-90010 is another next-generation BET inhibitor with encouraging antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors [104]. The abundances of BRD2 and BRD4 are significantly increased in GBM. Therefore, treatment with BET protein inhibitor (I-BET151) inhibits GBM cell proliferation [105]. Moreover, OTX015 exhibits a higher antiproliferative effect than its analog (JQ1) in GBM cell lines [106]. Meanwhile, JQ1 and I-BET 762 effectively interfere with multiple pathways associated with cell growth in pancreatic cancer [107]. Overall, the traditional small-molecule BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 and the newly developed BET inhibitors show promising results in various human cancers.

		- KMT & KDM inhibitors
			The past decade has seen tremendous progress in the characterization of the regulation of methyl modifications by KMTs and KDMs. Inhibitors of these two enzymes have also attracted much attention in the treatment of cancer. For instance, the effect of a LSD1/KDM1A selective inhibitor (ORY-1001) was evaluated in patients with blood disorders [104, 108]. BIX-01294 is a small-molecule inhibitor of EHMT2 that inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of cancer cells in DLBCL [109] and human neuroblastoma [110]. Similarly, UNC0638 is a EHMT2 inhibitor that substantially reduces cell growth and induces apoptosis in non-SCLC cells [111]. The involvement of DOT1L in multiple cancer processes provides compelling support for its inhibition as a basis for targeted therapeutics against cancers. Pinometostat (EPZ-5676) is a first-in-class small-molecule DOT1L inhibitor, for the treatment of adult acute leukemia [112]. EPZ004777 is another potent selective DOT1L inhibitor that selectively kills cells carrying MLL-associated gene translocation and prolongs survival in vitro [113]. Treatment with GSK126 (an EZH2 inhibitor) inhibits the growth of immune-deficient tumor cells [114]. In addition, small-molecule EZH2 inhibitors eliminate tumor cell growth in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma through a mechanism induced by the tumor suppressor protein, p16INK4A [115]. These studies and clinical trials suggest that KDMs and KMTs inhibitors are prospective for cancer clinical diagnosis and treatment.

	- MDR genes, such as MDR1 and MDR2, are highly responsible for anticancer resistance, since they increase epigenetic gene expression, EMT, and anti-apoptotic factors and significantly decrease P53 tumor antigens
		- the most common drug resistance mechanism is the efflux of hydrophobic drugs, mediated by ATP-dependent ABC transporters, such as P-gp, an integral membrane protein that is overexpressed in various malignancies
		- the broad substrate specificity and abundance of ABC transporter proteins represent significant challenges to circumventing ABC-mediated MDR in vivo. However, several new drugs, small molecules, and monoclonal antibodies have been identified that directly target oncogenic factors. 

	- increase cancer-favoring decreased drug absorption/usage

	- decrease cancer-favoring increased drug excretion/deactivation/detoxification/sequestration

	- increase in target potency and selectivity, identifying alternative chemical scaffolds, changing mechanism of action (covalents, PROTACs), increasing blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP), targeting of allosteric pockets

	- restore cancer-favoring altered metabolism

	- restore cancer-favoring altered drug target site

	- activation of alternative signalling pathways

	- decrease cancer-favoring improved DNA damage repair
		- Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) participates in DNA damage repair in cancer cells
			- inhibit PARP1 to prevent cancer cells from repairing their DNA

	- increase cancer-favoring inhibited cell senescence (decrease cancer-favoring apoptotis suppression)
		- decrease BCL-2 which is anti-apoptosis
		- increase Topo II, Bax/Bak, p53 which are pro-apoptosis
		- upregulated BCL-2 and loss-of-function mutated p53 (TP53), and downregulation of topoisomerase II (Topo-II) decrease apoptosis and thereby increase cancer cell resistance
		- ATP and LRP remove anti-cancer drugs from cancer cells
			- ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter is an ATP-activated transporter
				- cells express ABC transporters to remove foreign structures (like anticancer drugs) from the cell
				- ABC transporter proteins include:
					- multi-drug resistant protein 1 (MRP1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and P-gp (p-glycoprotein, a product of the MDR1 gene)
			- lung resistance protein (LRP) is in cytoplasmic vaults and contributes to exocytosis of foreign structures (like anticancer drugs)
		- MDR1/MDR2 (a phosphatidylcholine transporter) 
		- ABCC5 with FOXM1 (Fork headbox (FOX) molecules) was highly expressed in cancer cells that were paclitaxel-resistant
	
	- targeting tumor neo-antigens

	- deactivate a possible target receptor that becomes activated, either through overexpression or a secondary mutation (like the kinase domain/ectodomain mutation of EGFR or the overexpression of a truncated version of the target receptor)
	- reverse bypass activation, leading to the amplification of other isoforms

	- restore cancer-favoring epigenetic changes (methylation, demethylation, phosphorylation, etc)
		- inhibit genes that favor cancer-resistance
			- transcription factor inhibitors
			- allele-specific inhibitors
			- restoring tumor suppressors
		- reverse gain-of-function mutations in downstream components (including PIK3CA, BRAF, KRAS)
		- reverse loss-of-function mutations (including p53, PTEN, a well-known inhibitor of the downstream pathway)
		- signaling pathway genes
			- Ras, v-mos, src, protein kinase C (PKC), and other oncogenes involved in signaling pathways can mediate multi-drug resistance
		- ABCB1/MDR1, ABCC1/2/5, ABCG2, Bcl-2, EGFR, TP53 are resistance-related genes
		- P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP are the three most implicated transporters in cancer drug resistance
		- subclonal driver mutations in ESR1 and in genes of the PI3K pathway are sufficient to drive resistance to targeted therapies
		- genes with high response rates: HER2, ALK, NTRK, BRAF, mutant-selective EGFR
		- genes with low response rates: anti-PI3K, MEK, FLT3, mTOR - owing to either off-target inhibition of other closely related mutant proteins or on-target inhibition of the wild-type protein (which can cause marked side effects as a result of the critical role of the protein in normal homeostasis)

	- other mechanisms
		- advanced tyrosine-kinase inhibitors
		- allosteric inhibitors

	- decrease cancer-favoring target gene amplification

	- decrease cancer-favoring immune system evasion

	- decrease cancer-favoring cancer stem cells

	- decrease cancer-favoring tumor microenvironment/tumor heterogeneity/metabolism
		- Tumor cell metabolism is a prototypical example of dynamic, heterogeneous, and adaptive phenotypic trait, resulting from the combination of intrinsic [(epi)genetic changes, tissue of origin and differentiation dependency] and extrinsic (oxygen and nutrient availability, metabolic interactions within the TME) factors, enabling cancer cells to survive, metastasize and develop resistance to anticancer therapies
		- amino acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism support the growth of therapy-resistant cancers and/or cellular subpopulations
		
	- decrease cancer-favoring epithetial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells

	- decrease cancer-favoring intracellular/extracellular ATP in cancer cells which promotes drug resistance 

	- Some mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint blockade have been elucidated, including the loss of β2-microglobulin (which impairs tumoral antigen presentation) and JAK1 or JAK2 mutations (which render tumour cells insensitive to interferon gamma)

	- the most formidable oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes include MYC, RAS and TP53
		- miniproteins that prevent MYC dimerization
		- allele-specific inhibitors that trap and inactivate mutant KRAS(G12C)
		- small molecules that covalently bind to p53 to restore its normal (wild-type) function

	- RAF inhibitors that inhibit the formation of RAF homodimers and heterodimers
		- Other oncogenic drivers, such as class 2 mutations in BRAF (which result in mutant BRAF proteins that signal as RAS-independent constitutive dimers), are only partially inhibited by existing allosteric MEK inhibitors, owing to an inadequate therapeutic index

	- target indifference (in which the effects of targeting an oncogenic driver are attenuated by downstream or parallel alterations in the pathway) can drive resistance, such as in resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colon cancer, which can be mediated by downstream KRAS/NRAS-activating mutations

	- Adaptive mechanisms are often the result of non-genetic relief of negative feedback of signalling pathways and/or epigenetic modulation, which causes the activation of parallel pathways, or reactivation of the initial pathway
		- For example, BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers are insensitive to BRAF inhibitors, owing to reactivation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, but BRAF-mutant melanomas express only low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this relief of negative feedback

	- resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is frequently driven by gatekeeper mutations and other driver mutations, which maintain oncogene dependence by preventing access to the site where ATP-competitive TKIs bind
		- Other acquired causes of TKI resistance include amplification of the gene and splice variants

	- Characteristic mutations that are associated with acquired resistance can also develop in the ligand-binding domains of nuclear hormone receptors, resulting in ligand-independent transcription

	- Another mode of acquired resistance to kinase inhibition is the amplification of an upstream gene, which can bring about resistance to therapy that targets a downstream molecule; this is exemplified by MET amplification driving resistance to EGFR inhibitors

	- Tumour suppressor mutations can also drive resistance to targeted therapies, including mutations in PTEN (which drive PI3Kβ signalling in response to PI3Kα inhibitors) and reversion mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in response to PARP inhibitors

	- phenotypic changes may occur, such as how transformation to aggressive neuroendocrine phenotypes has been noted in prostate tumours that are initially responsive to antiandrogens, and in EGFR-mutant NSCLC that is initially responsive to TKIs
		- these tumours acquire the loss of RB1 and TP53 and become resistant to antiandrogens or EGFR TKIs
		- Investigations into the mechanisms of changes in cell plasticity have implicated the SOX2 transcription factor, which is upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer
		- We speculate that additional transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms drive lineage plasticity in cancers that are responsive to targeted therapies, leading to target independence

	- multiple agents of differing potency or robustness to resistance mechanisms are available, and upfront application of the best inhibitor or combination appears to result in improved outcomes, compared to sequential use
		- For example, treatment with the more-potent EGFR-mutant-selective inhibitor osimertinib, or the ALK inhibitor alectinib, prolongs progression-free survival in NSCLC compared to first-generation EGFR or ALK inhibitors
		- In chronic myeloid leukaemia, dual targeting of ABL by a combination of catalytic and allosteric inhibitors drives a potent response that is sustained even when treatment is discontinued
		- For example, patients with germline BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer who show an apparent partial or complete response after platinum-based chemotherapy can be driven into an even deeper response with two years of maintenance olaparib
		- The resulting efficacy data, which demonstrate a remission rate of 60% at three years after the start of PARP inhibitor therapy, suggest that this approach is increasing the fraction of patients that are cured of their disease. 

	- PI3K inhibitors yield low response rates as monotherapy, but when used in combination with anti-endocrine therapy in ER+ PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer they improve progression-free survival
		- combining PI3K inhibitors with a ketogenic diet that blunts adaptive exogenous insulin signalling and resensitizes cells to PI3K inhibitors
		- the combination of CDK4/6 inhibition with PI3K inhibition can resensitize cells to PI3K inhibition

	- Some oncogene targets (such as BCR–ABL in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gene fusions in members of the NTRK family in a variety of tumour types, or mutant EGFR in lung cancer) do not result in an adaptive response that is meaningful
		- classically, these tumours respond to their respective targeted therapies for prolonged periods of time until mechanisms of acquired resistance eventually take over. 
		- however, adaptive responses are the norm when components of key cellular pathways such as the HER2–PI3K–AKT–mTOR and RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathways are targeted
		- Similarly, targeting ER in breast cancer and AR in prostate cancer induces rich cellular responses that reduce the effects of internal or external perturbations

	- To some extent, these adaptive cancer dependencies can be identified through experimental testing
		- genes that confer resistance to inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway in BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic melanoma have been identified through gain-of-function genetic screens and genomic or transcriptomic sequencing of melanomas that are resistant to therapy
		- These large datasets of putative genes that confer drug resistance converge on ERK-dependent, ERK-independent and pathway-indifferent states that induce cellular pathway reactivation

	- mechanisms that downregulate the presentation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in cancer cells (such as mutation of Β2M, JAK1 or JAK2) predominate among the known mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy

	- Studies have shown that the selective TRK inhibitor larotrectinib is highly efficacious in an age- and tumour-agnostic manner in TRK-fusion-positive cancers

	- combination of ER and CDK4/6 antagonists in the treatment of ER+ breast cancer, which results in a synergistic control of disease compared to anti-ER therapy alone
