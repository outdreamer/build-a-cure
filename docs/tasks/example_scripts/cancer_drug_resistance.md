				- strategy for Aurora-A inhibitors in RB1, ARID1A and MYC gene mutation tumors, and potential synergistic strategy for mTOR, PAK1, MDM2, MEK inhibitors or PD-L1 antibodies combined with targeting Aurora-A kinase
						- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37521867/
						- Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A), a serine/threonine kinase, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including mitotic entry, centrosome maturation and spindle formation. 
						- Overexpression or gene-amplification/mutation of Aurora-A kinase occurs in different types of cancer, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. 
						- Alteration of Aurora-A impacts multiple cancer hallmarks, especially, immortalization, energy metabolism, immune escape and cell death resistance which are involved in cancer progression and resistance
						- Specifically, the mechanisms of Aurora-A kinase promote acquired resistance through modulating DNA damage repair, feedback activation bypass pathways, resistance to apoptosis, necroptosis and autophagy, metastasis, and stemness

- targets

	- MDR genes, such as MDR1 and MDR2, are highly responsible for anticancer resistance, since they increase epigenetic gene expression, EMT, and anti-apoptotic factors and significantly decrease P53 tumor antigens
		- the most common drug resistance mechanism is the efflux of hydrophobic drugs, mediated by ATP-dependent ABC transporters, such as P-gp, an integral membrane protein that is overexpressed in various malignancies
		- the broad substrate specificity and abundance of ABC transporter proteins represent significant challenges to circumventing ABC-mediated MDR in vivo. However, several new drugs, small molecules, and monoclonal antibodies have been identified that directly target oncogenic factors. 

	- increase cancer-favoring decreased drug absorption/usage

	- decrease cancer-favoring increased drug excretion/deactivation/detoxification/sequestration

	- increase in target potency and selectivity, identifying alternative chemical scaffolds, changing mechanism of action (covalents, PROTACs), increasing blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP), targeting of allosteric pockets

	- restore cancer-favoring altered metabolism

	- restore cancer-favoring altered drug target site

	- activation of alternative signalling pathways

	- decrease cancer-favoring improved DNA damage repair
		- Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) participates in DNA damage repair in cancer cells
			- inhibit PARP1 to prevent cancer cells from repairing their DNA

	- increase cancer-favoring inhibited cell senescence (decrease cancer-favoring apoptotis suppression)
		- decrease BCL-2 which is anti-apoptosis
		- increase Topo II, Bax/Bak, p53 which are pro-apoptosis
		- upregulated BCL-2 and loss-of-function mutated p53 (TP53), and downregulation of topoisomerase II (Topo-II) decrease apoptosis and thereby increase cancer cell resistance
		- ATP and LRP remove anti-cancer drugs from cancer cells
			- ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter is an ATP-activated transporter
				- cells express ABC transporters to remove foreign structures (like anticancer drugs) from the cell
				- ABC transporter proteins include:
					- multi-drug resistant protein 1 (MRP1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and P-gp (p-glycoprotein, a product of the MDR1 gene)
			- lung resistance protein (LRP) is in cytoplasmic vaults and contributes to exocytosis of foreign structures (like anticancer drugs)
		- MDR1/MDR2 (a phosphatidylcholine transporter) 
		- ABCC5 with FOXM1 (Fork headbox (FOX) molecules) was highly expressed in cancer cells that were paclitaxel-resistant
	
	- targeting tumor neo-antigens

	- deactivate a possible target receptor that becomes activated, either through overexpression or a secondary mutation (like the kinase domain/ectodomain mutation of EGFR or the overexpression of a truncated version of the target receptor)
	- reverse bypass activation, leading to the amplification of other isoforms

	- restore cancer-favoring epigenetic changes (methylation, demethylation, phosphorylation, etc)
		- inhibit genes that favor cancer-resistance
			- transcription factor inhibitors
			- allele-specific inhibitors
			- restoring tumor suppressors
		- reverse gain-of-function mutations in downstream components (including PIK3CA, BRAF, KRAS)
		- reverse loss-of-function mutations (including p53, PTEN, a well-known inhibitor of the downstream pathway)
		- signaling pathway genes
			- Ras, v-mos, src, protein kinase C (PKC), and other oncogenes involved in signaling pathways can mediate multi-drug resistance
		- ABCB1/MDR1, ABCC1/2/5, ABCG2, Bcl-2, EGFR, TP53 are resistance-related genes
		- P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP are the three most implicated transporters in cancer drug resistance
		- subclonal driver mutations in ESR1 and in genes of the PI3K pathway are sufficient to drive resistance to targeted therapies
		- genes with high response rates: HER2, ALK, NTRK, BRAF, mutant-selective EGFR
		- genes with low response rates: anti-PI3K, MEK, FLT3, mTOR - owing to either off-target inhibition of other closely related mutant proteins or on-target inhibition of the wild-type protein (which can cause marked side effects as a result of the critical role of the protein in normal homeostasis)

	- other mechanisms
		- advanced tyrosine-kinase inhibitors
		- allosteric inhibitors

	- decrease cancer-favoring target gene amplification

	- decrease cancer-favoring immune system evasion

	- decrease cancer-favoring cancer stem cells

	- decrease cancer-favoring tumor microenvironment/tumor heterogeneity/metabolism
		- Tumor cell metabolism is a prototypical example of dynamic, heterogeneous, and adaptive phenotypic trait, resulting from the combination of intrinsic [(epi)genetic changes, tissue of origin and differentiation dependency] and extrinsic (oxygen and nutrient availability, metabolic interactions within the TME) factors, enabling cancer cells to survive, metastasize and develop resistance to anticancer therapies
		- amino acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism support the growth of therapy-resistant cancers and/or cellular subpopulations
		
	- decrease cancer-favoring epithetial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells

	- decrease cancer-favoring intracellular/extracellular ATP in cancer cells which promotes drug resistance 

	- Some mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint blockade have been elucidated, including the loss of Î²2-microglobulin (which impairs tumoral antigen presentation) and JAK1 or JAK2 mutations (which render tumour cells insensitive to interferon gamma)

	- the most formidable oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes include MYC, RAS and TP53
		- miniproteins that prevent MYC dimerization
		- allele-specific inhibitors that trap and inactivate mutant KRAS(G12C)
		- small molecules that covalently bind to p53 to restore its normal (wild-type) function

	- RAF inhibitors that inhibit the formation of RAF homodimers and heterodimers
		- Other oncogenic drivers, such as class 2 mutations in BRAF (which result in mutant BRAF proteins that signal as RAS-independent constitutive dimers), are only partially inhibited by existing allosteric MEK inhibitors, owing to an inadequate therapeutic index

	- target indifference (in which the effects of targeting an oncogenic driver are attenuated by downstream or parallel alterations in the pathway) can drive resistance, such as in resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colon cancer, which can be mediated by downstream KRAS/NRAS-activating mutations

	- Adaptive mechanisms are often the result of non-genetic relief of negative feedback of signalling pathways and/or epigenetic modulation, which causes the activation of parallel pathways, or reactivation of the initial pathway
		- For example, BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers are insensitive to BRAF inhibitors, owing to reactivation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, but BRAF-mutant melanomas express only low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this relief of negative feedback

	- resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is frequently driven by gatekeeper mutations and other driver mutations, which maintain oncogene dependence by preventing access to the site where ATP-competitive TKIs bind
		- Other acquired causes of TKI resistance include amplification of the gene and splice variants

	- Characteristic mutations that are associated with acquired resistance can also develop in the ligand-binding domains of nuclear hormone receptors, resulting in ligand-independent transcription

	- Another mode of acquired resistance to kinase inhibition is the amplification of an upstream gene, which can bring about resistance to therapy that targets a downstream molecule; this is exemplified by MET amplification driving resistance to EGFR inhibitors

	- Tumour suppressor mutations can also drive resistance to targeted therapies, including mutations in PTEN (which drive PI3KÎ² signalling in response to PI3KÎ± inhibitors) and reversion mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in response to PARP inhibitors

	- phenotypic changes may occur, such as how transformation to aggressive neuroendocrine phenotypes has been noted in prostate tumours that are initially responsive to antiandrogens, and in EGFR-mutant NSCLC that is initially responsive to TKIs
		- these tumours acquire the loss of RB1 and TP53 and become resistant to antiandrogens or EGFR TKIs
		- Investigations into the mechanisms of changes in cell plasticity have implicated the SOX2 transcription factor, which is upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer
		- We speculate that additional transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms drive lineage plasticity in cancers that are responsive to targeted therapies, leading to target independence

	- multiple agents of differing potency or robustness to resistance mechanisms are available, and upfront application of the best inhibitor or combination appears to result in improved outcomes, compared to sequential use
		- For example, treatment with the more-potent EGFR-mutant-selective inhibitor osimertinib, or the ALK inhibitor alectinib, prolongs progression-free survival in NSCLC compared to first-generation EGFR or ALK inhibitors
		- In chronic myeloid leukaemia, dual targeting of ABL by a combination of catalytic and allosteric inhibitors drives a potent response that is sustained even when treatment is discontinued
		- For example, patients with germline BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer who show an apparent partial or complete response after platinum-based chemotherapy can be driven into an even deeper response with two years of maintenance olaparib
		- The resulting efficacy data, which demonstrate a remission rate of 60% at three years after the start of PARP inhibitor therapy, suggest that this approach is increasing the fraction of patients that are cured of their disease. 

	- PI3K inhibitors yield low response rates as monotherapy, but when used in combination with anti-endocrine therapy in ER+ PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer they improve progression-free survival
		- combining PI3K inhibitors with a ketogenic diet that blunts adaptive exogenous insulin signalling and resensitizes cells to PI3K inhibitors
		- the combination of CDK4/6 inhibition with PI3K inhibition can resensitize cells to PI3K inhibition

	- Some oncogene targets (such as BCRâABL in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gene fusions in members of the NTRK family in a variety of tumour types, or mutant EGFR in lung cancer) do not result in an adaptive response that is meaningful
		- classically, these tumours respond to their respective targeted therapies for prolonged periods of time until mechanisms of acquired resistance eventually take over. 
		- however, adaptive responses are the norm when components of key cellular pathways such as the HER2âPI3KâAKTâmTOR and RASâRAFâMEKâERK pathways are targeted
		- Similarly, targeting ER in breast cancer and AR in prostate cancer induces rich cellular responses that reduce the effects of internal or external perturbations

	- To some extent, these adaptive cancer dependencies can be identified through experimental testing
		- genes that confer resistance to inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway in BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic melanoma have been identified through gain-of-function genetic screens and genomic or transcriptomic sequencing of melanomas that are resistant to therapy
		- These large datasets of putative genes that confer drug resistance converge on ERK-dependent, ERK-independent and pathway-indifferent states that induce cellular pathway reactivation

	- mechanisms that downregulate the presentation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in cancer cells (such as mutation of Î2M, JAK1 or JAK2) predominate among the known mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy

	- Studies have shown that the selective TRK inhibitor larotrectinib is highly efficacious in an age- and tumour-agnostic manner in TRK-fusion-positive cancers

	- combination of ER and CDK4/6 antagonists in the treatment of ER+ breast cancer, which results in a synergistic control of disease compared to anti-ER therapy alone
