- various mechanisms of action of inhibiting cancer (and associated anti-tumor substances)


	- the point of these lists is to group substances with functions/effects/structures that either inhibit specific processes that favor cancer, or activate specific processes that suppress/reduce cancer in specific cells/genes/pathways
		- this includes processes such as:
			- angiogenesis, prenylation, phosphorylation, methylation, mutation, activation, oxidation, protein ubiquitination, acetylation, inflammation, ubiquitinization (adding a ubiquitous regulatory protein called 'ubiquitin' to another protein)
		- cancer variables
			- cholesterol
			- nitric oxide
			- tumor necrosis factor alpha
			- p53 and other relevant proteins
			- pro/anti-inflammatory interleukins
			- antioxidants to block reactive oxygen species
			- white blood cells
			- B/T cells
			- NK cells
			- growth factors
			- oncogenes and anti-cancer genes


	- general treatment strategies

		- treat other systemic conditions with treatment such as those mentioned in other_condition_treatments.md so the system has extra resources to fight cancer

		- reduce inflammation
			- anti-inflammatory substances
				- bromelain, cinnamon, berberine, chaga/maitake/reishi/shiitake, algae, fucoidan, magnesium, arginine, glucosamine, coq10, grape seed, fenugreek, taurine, propolis/honey/royal jelly (chrysin from pollen), ginger, indole carbinol, turmeric, ALA, NAC, pomegranate, chamomile, ginseng, zinc, aloe, dandelion, glutamine, olive leaf, nettle, vitamin c, resveratrol, ginkgo, Ashwagandha
			- antioxidants (to reduce negative impact of Reactive Oxygen Species) and reduce inflammation
				- medicines: N-acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, and dexamethasone
				- antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C powder, vitamin E, copper, zinc, selenium, glutathione, alpha lipoic acid (spinach, broccoli, tomatoes)
				- an antioxidant that helps protect your cells against the effects of free radicals
				- free radicals are molecules produced when your body breaks down food or is exposed to tobacco smoke and radiation from the sun, X-rays or other sources
				- Free radicals might play a role in heart disease, cancer and other diseases
				- Your body's cells naturally produce some powerful antioxidants, such as alpha lipoic acid and glutathione. 
					- The foods you eat supply other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E. 
					- Plants are full of compounds known as phytochemicals—literally, "plant chemicals"—many of which seem to have antioxidant properties as well. 
					- For example, after vitamin C has "quenched" a free radical by donating electrons to it, a phytochemical called hesperetin (found in oranges and other citrus fruits) restores the vitamin C to its active antioxidant form. Carotenoids (such as lycopene in tomatoes and lutein in kale) and flavonoids (such as flavanols in cocoa, anthocyanins in blueberries, quercetin in apples and onions, and catechins in green tea) are also antioxidants

		- avoid vitamin deficiencies/overdoses, and avoid vitamin antagonists which can cause deficiencies
			- https://return2health.com.au/articles/vitamin-mineral-antagonists
			- avoid when correcting vitamin deficiencies:
				- anti-convulsants (Barbituates, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Primidone, Valproic Acid, Zonisamide), birth control/estrogen, aminopterin, antibiotics, some anti-inflammatory agents, blood pressure medications/diuretics, metformin, alcohol, chlorogenic acid, caffeine/coffee/tea, raw fish, aspirin
			- calcium binders/antagonists: avoid excess oxalic acid, which is present in too-large amounts in spinach, rhubarb, beets and beet greens, Swiss chard and chocolate
			- vitamin a antagonists (nitrosamines, air pollutants, mineral oil, Blood-thinning medications and other drugs, including aspirin, phenobarbitol, arsenicals and dicumarol)
			- vitamin k antagonists (antibiotics, dicumarol and hydrocoumarol, which are used by medical people to relieve thrombosis (abnormal formation of blood clots in the blood vessels)
			- vitamin c antagonists (cigarette smoke, ammonium chloride, stribesterol, thiouracil, atropine, barbituates, antihistamines, alcohol, stressors such as surgery or extreme temperatures)
			- thiamine antagonists (ortho/para-hydroxyphenols, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, tannic acid, quercetin and rutin)
			- b vitamin antagonists:
				- alcohol
				- folate deficiency
				- Cortisone
				- chloroalanine, acetylenic compounds (e.g. propargylglycine) and vinylic compounds (e.g. vinylglycine), α-methyl and amino-oxy substrate analogs (e.g. α-methylglutamate)
				- Levothyroxine (pyridoxal-5-phosphate)
				- The inactive form pyridoxine competitively inhibits the active pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (symptoms of vitamin B6 supplementation in the pyridoxine form can mimic those of vitamin B6 deficiency, an effect which can be avoided by supplementing with P5P instead)
				- AlaP (alanine phosphonate) inhibits alanine racemases, but its lack of specificity has prompted further designs of ALR inhibitors
				- Gabaculine and Vigabatrin inhibit GABA aminotransferase
				- Canaline and 5-fluoromethylornithine inhibit ornithine aminotransferase
				- Amino-oxy SAM inhibits ACC synthase
				- egg whites (avidin)
				- antifolate dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (antimicrobial trimethoprim, the antiprotozoal pyrimethamine and the chemotherapy drug methotrexate, and the sulfonamides (competitive inhibitors of 4-aminobenzoic acid in the reactions of dihydropteroate synthetase))
				- Valproic acid/valproate, amoxicillin, erythromycin, methotrexate and pyrimethamine, proton pump inhibitors, h2 inhibitors, metformin, colchicine, extended-release potassium products, and antibiotics such as gentamicin, neomycin and tobramycin, Anti-seizure medications (phenobarbital, pregabalin, primidone and topiramate)


- relevant structures to cancer

	- oncometabolites
		- these compounds can trigger cancer when their metabolism is dysregulated and when they are produced/available in that dysregulated state
		- Cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis, which is reached through defects in enzymes involved in normal cell metabolism, this allows the cancer cells to meet their energy needs and divert acetyl-CoA from the TCA cycle to build essential biomolecules such as amino acids and lipids
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncometabolism
			Oncometabolite			Role														Oncogenes							Enzyme affected								Associated malignancies
			D-2-hydroxyglutarate	Inhibits ATP synthase and mTOR signalling					IDH1 IDH2 							Isocitrate dehydrogenase					Brain cancer, Leukemia
			Succinate				Inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase					SDHA,SDHB,SDHC,SDHD,SDHAF1,SDHAF2	succinate dehydrogenase						Renal and Thyroid tumors
			Fumarate				Inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase					FH									Fumarate hydratase							Leiomyomata, Renal cysts

			Lactate					Induces local immunosuppression								LDHA								Lactate dehydrogenase A						Various types of cancer
			Glutamine*				Primary carbon-source for the biosynthesis of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate
		- oncometabolites include: 
			- 2‐hydroxyglutarate, glucose, fumarate, succinate, sarcosine, glutamine, asparagine, choline, and lactate
			- these are suggested as biomarkers in glioma, prostate, gastrointestinal, breast, and endocrine cancers
		- for example, 2‐hydroxyglutarate (the D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) form of the TCA cycle intermediate, α‐ketoglutarate) is in limited quantity in normal tissues but is at a higher concentrations in cancer cells
			- This oncometabolite is the result of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1 or IDH2) gene mutation commonly occurring in gliomas and acute myelogenousleukemias (AMLs)
			- Increasing D2HG can change dioxygenase function requiring α‐ketoglutarate, change the epigenome of the cell (like prolylhydroxylation of 5‐methyl cytosine in DNA), and inhibit histone lysine demethylase
	
	- oncogenes
		- for example, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor is a possible treatment target, bc EGFR is an oncogene
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene
		- oncogenes, grouped by type
			- Growth factors, or mitogens
				- such as c-Sis													
				- induces cell proliferation

				- involved in signalling a major pathway leading to cell proliferation
			- Transcription factors
				- such as myc gene

		- chicory 
			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912540/
			- A first group of nine Diet-induced gene expression profiles, modified by the chicory diet, is involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, and their deregulation suggests a cell growth arrest and a putative anti-cancer effect
		- Uncaria tomentosa
			- reduce tumor growth
			- increased apoptosis
			- Treatment with ethanolic extracts of Uncaria tomentosa were much more effective than treatment with aqueous extracts
			- U. tomentosa was also shown to inhibit B16-BL6 cell growth in C57/bl mice in vivo
				- Histochemical analysis of the B16-BL6 tumours showed a strong reduction in the Ki-67 cell proliferation marker in U. tomentosa-treated mice and a small, but insignificant increase in terminal transferase dUTP nick labelling (TUNEL) staining
		    - reduced angiogenesis
		    - reduced infiltration of T cells into the tumours

			- anti-proliferative agent, interfering with the cell cycle in several ways
			- inhibits the activity of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
				- The anti-inflammatory action is due to deacylation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB by sirtuin 1
			- upregulate glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant
				- It has direct activity as a reducing agent, chemically reacting with reactive oxygen species to neutralize them. Studies suggest that it lodges in cell membranes and prevents oxidative damage to lipids in the cell membrane


	- inhibit mutations/bacteria/fungi/viruses that cause cancer (Li-Fraumeni syndrome, EBV, HPV, Herpes, Hepatitis)
		- inherited mutations
			- Abnormalities of the p53 gene can be inherited in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which increases the risk of developing various types of cancers
		- fungi
			- wherever fungi can cause cancer, they can often be inhibited by antifungal compounds such as:
				- holy basil (has eugenol, which disrupts fungal cell wall) and citicoline
					- Holy basil might lower thyroxine levels. In theory, this could worsen hypothyroidism (this might also interfere with inhibiting PCNA)
				- other substances commonly found in antifungal supplements:
					- oregano (thymol, carvacrol), undecylenic acid, pau d'arco (lapachol), black walnut, garlic, olive leaf, elderberry, grape seed, danshen, chinese skullcap (baicalen), caprylic acid, turmeric, ginger, sitosterol, neem, jatoba, beta-glucanase, hemicellulase, fulvic acid, licorice, star anise, cordyceps, reishi, ashwagandha, quercetin, lactic acid-producing bacteria, bacillus subtilis, wormwood, artemisin, apigenin, lactoferrin, horopito (polgodial)

					- reishi, cordyceps, milk thistle, NAC, schisandra, irish sea moss, black cumin seed oil, burdock, bladderwrack, black pepper, turmeric, beet root, artichoke leaf, chanca piedra, dandelion, choline, chicory, yarrow, jujube, celery, ginger, alfalfa, caper bush, arjuna, tamarisk, black nightshade, cassia occidentalis, zinc, L-methionine, feverfew, grape seed, yellow dock root, raspberry, berberine HCL, l-cysteine HCL, rutin, amla 
					- nattokinase/serrapeptase are also found in liver supplements, but have some cardiac/blood pressure side effects
					- enzymes like papain/bromelain are also found in liver supplements, possibly to reduce the work of the liver
				- alpha lipoic acid: regenerates liver tissue, reverse the complications of diabetes mellitus, slow or stop the growth of cancer cells, and chelate heavy metals
				- Licorice root contains an active compound called glycyrrhizic acid, which may help reduce inflammation in the liver and regenerate damaged liver cells
					- licorice impacts the heart and blood potassium negatively so avoid licorice where possible
				- supplements associated with liver cirrhosis treatment:
					- spironolactone, thiamine, caffeine/coffee, NAC, fish oil, glutathione, sea buckthorn, cocoa, danshen, astragalus, selenium, taurine, l-carnitine, Bacillus Coagulans, L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate, Casein Protein, choline, peony, branched-chain amino acids
				- avoid
					- a damaged liver is stressed by excess iron, niacin, and vitamin A (the retinol type)
			- HPV
				- factors
					- oncoproteins E6/E7 are involved in HPV carcinogenic activity
						- HPV protein E6 binds to p53 tumor suppressor and inhibits it, and HPV protein E7 targets the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
					- when mRNA genes UBE2L3 and CYP1A1 are over-expressed or activated, HPV activity is suppressed
					- when IFN-β is suppressed, HPV activity is suppressed
				- suppressors
					- withaferin A
						- suppresses oncoproteins E6/E7
					- AHCC
						- suppression of the IFN-β level to less than 20 pg/ml correlated with clearance of HPV infections
						- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35814366/
					- indole-3-carbinol
						- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35678668/
						- I3C induces the mRNA Overexpression of UBE2L3 gene and Cell Proliferation Arrest
						- I3C is a natural AhR ligand (AHR reduces tumor growth and impacts UBE2L3 gene, which impacts HPV proteins E6/7)
						- HPV virus oncoprotein E6 binds to p53, resulting in its degradation and allowing uncontrolled cell proliferation
						- HPV E7 protein maintains host cell differentiation by targeting retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
						- The host cell can ubiquitinate E6 and E7 through UBE2L3 gene, whose expression depends on the interaction between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) with Xenobiotic Responsive Elements (XREs) located in the UBE2L3 gene promoter
						- We found that I3C promotes the activation of AhR and decreases cell proliferation, possibly through UBE2L3 mRNA induction, which would result in the ubiquitination of HPV E7
			- EBV
				- green tea suppresses EBV
					- EGCG, a polyphenol in green tea, has shown in a study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA, gene transcription, and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV lytic genes Zta, Rta, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by Rta), however, the highly stable EBNA-1 gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein–Barr_virus
				- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868022/
				- EBV causes Multiple Sclerosis, and can also cause cancer by mutating certain genes
					- EBV-associated cancers are mainly lymphomas derived from B cells and T cells and carcinomas derived from epithelial cells
					- EBV can induce oncogenesis in its host cell by activating various signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), Janus kinase/signal transducer and transcription activator (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and Wnt/β-catenin, which are regulated by EBV-encoded proteins and noncoding RNA
					- It has been found that EBNA1 may induce chromosomal breakage in the 11th chromosome, specifically in the 11q23 region between the FAM55D gene and FAM55B, which EBNA-1 appears to have a high affinity for due to its DNA-binding domain having an interest in a specific palindromic repeat in this section of the genome. While the cause and exact mechanism for this is unknown, the byproduct results in errors and breakage of the chromosomal structure as cells stemming from the line of the tainted genome undergo mitosis. Since genes in this area have been implicated in leukemia and is home to a tumor suppressor gene (such as tumor suppressors p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX activated by ATM serine/threonine kinase) that is modified or not present in most tumor gene expression, it's been hypothesized that breakage in this area is the main culprit behind the cancers that EBV increases the chance of.
					- ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)
						- a defect in ATM has severe consequences in repairing certain types of damage to DNA, and cancer may result from improper repair
				- Therapy/drug							Target					Function																		Cancer/disease				
					CTL									LMP1/LMP2				Stimulates LMP-specific T cell expansion										NK/T cell lymphoma				
					TCR									EBNA1/LMP1/LMP2A		Stimulate and expand EBV-specific CD8 + T cells in patients						Progressive multiple sclerosis

					AT13387								Hsp90					Inhibits AKT/p-AKT expression/cancer cell proliferation/restores p27 function 	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
					- Inhibitors of USP7 (ubiquitin-specific processing protease 7)
						- Stabilization by USP7 is important for the tumor suppressor function of p53
						- Compromising the function of p53 by sequestering USP7 is one way EBNA1 can contribute to the oncogenic potential of EBV	

	- inhibit oncometabolites (useful when metabolism of relevant structures are dysregulated)
		- 'repairing/inhibiting oncometabolite dysregulation (or their production, when already dysregulated)' is a treatment target for avoiding states where these metabolites become carcinogenic
			- inhibit glycolysis/lactate production
				- inhibit glycolysis/lactate, by inhibiting hexokinase 2
					- 2HG, suggested as an identifier oncometabolite of brain cancer and leukemia patients is a potential target of drugs that targets their coding gene IDH1
					- hexokinase 2 is a major contributor to high glycolysis and lactate production, hence targeting hexokinase 2 in the rabbit VX2 tumor model for liver cancer was suggested
				- inhibit glycolysis
					- The small molecule 3‐bromopyruvate (3BP), a glycolysis inhibitor, has a potent anticancer activity and has the capacity to eradicate cancers in different animal models

				- Glutaminolysis in many cancers is the prominent target in cancer therapy
					- some compounds showed cytotoxic effects against several malignant tumors types like leukemia and colorectal cancers
						- 6‐diazo‐5‐oxo‐l‐norleucine (DON) and acivicin


	- reduce factors in specific cancers
		- reduce mammary density (a risk factor for breast cancer)
			- boswellic acid, betaine, and myo-inositol
		- Piperlongumine
			- an amide alkaloid used to neutralize glioblastoma cancer cells


	- avoiding known carcinogens
		- regulations currently allow many poisonous substances in products and on shelves, so buy as few unnecessary products as possible
		- toxicities
			- avoid toxicities such as overdoses of lipid-soluble vitamins like vitamin A which is involved in T-cells/immunity/cancer (avoid over-using supplements or retinol or other substances that you dont know all the effects of)
			- remove/reduce toxic heavy metals like lead/cadmium which can be carcinogenic (heavy metal exposure can trigger double strand breaks, the most serious types of DNA damage, and inhibit subsequent repair)
				- chlorella
				- cilantro 
				- avoid foods that can have higher levels of lead/cadmium than other foods (unless the manufacturer explicitly removes them)
					- basil, oregano, thyme, rice, fruit juice, coffee, chocolate
				- these foods were more often found to have safer levels of lead/cadmium
					- black pepper, coriander/cilantro, curry powder, garlic powder, saffron, sesame seeds
			- agglutinins
				- various agglutinins have immune system effects (peanut agglutinins have a positive assocation with cancer, wheat germs have an unclear association, whereas abrus agglutinins may be helpful in reducing cancer)
			- coumarins
				- Citrus fruits are high in secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, limonoids, and coumarins, which are associated with a reduced risk of cancer
				- however citrus 'juices' were also associated with higher risk of non-melanoma skin cancer https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33946526/
			- avoid animal protein during cancer treatment (which is high in methionine/cysteine compared to most vegetable protein)
				- a low protein diet with vegetable protein delayed tumor growth
		- plastics (PFAS, BPA)
			- that means washing clothes twice before wearing, using non-toxic laundry detergent and soap and anything else that touches your skin, not buying plastic anything such as shower curtains, not trying on new clothes without washing them first, looking for ways to clean PFAS from your water, avoiding food that binds to PFAS such as kale, avoiding soda cans made with BPA (avoiding canned food at all, similarly avoiding ceramic containers that may contain lead, instead using wood/pyrex where possible), etc
			- these can cause organ failure which can make it more difficult to fight cancer and can also cause cancer directly
			- plastics in products often accompany other harmful substances like formaldehyde which is a carcinogen
		- artificial sweeteners
			- monk fruit and stevia and possibly xylitol might be the only safe artificial sweeteners other than natural sugars like honey
		- TCE (Trichloroethylene) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichloroethylene
			- may still be used to separate some substances in food, like separating caffeine from coffee, also may be found in potato chips, processed meat, and other highly processed foods which may have had a reason to use a separating agent (such as separating grease from the food)
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen

			- Ionizing radiation/Ultraviolet light/Infrared light
			- air pollutants	
				- wear a Sundstrom mask (or use an activated carbon filter in your own mask) wherever possible, especially under chemtrails, around airports, in high ozone/pollution areas, when not in a room with good air filters
				- use air scrubbers to filter your air or air filters which filter most pollutants out
			- silica/VOCs like formaldehyde
				- avoid fragrances, and other substances where its difficult to determine the ingredients, and especially paint, which has carcinogens like silica and VOCs like formaldehyde in it
			- tobacco smoke
				- most important tumorigenic compounds in tobacco smoke were, in order of importance, acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide, and isoprene
				- smoke also triggers free radicals, antagonizes vitamin C, and exposes people to lead
				- Most of these compounds cause DNA damage by forming DNA adducts or by inducing other alterations in DNA
			- acetaldehyde
				- in a lot of foods naturally, but also in a lot of pollutants
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde
			- avoid alkylating agents 
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylating_antineoplastic_agent (when not using temozolomide for treatment)
		- other compounds can trigger cancer when used in large amounts or when other errors have occurred
			- nicotinamide
			- folate
			- bpc-157
