- various mechanisms of action of inhibiting cancer (and associated anti-tumor substances)

	- the point of these lists is to group substances with functions/effects/structures that either inhibit specific processes that favor cancer, or activate specific processes that suppress/reduce cancer in specific cells/genes/pathways
		- this includes processes such as:
			- angiogenesis, prenylation, phosphorylation, methylation, mutation, activation, oxidation, protein ubiquitination, acetylation, inflammation
		- cancer variables
			- cholesterol
			- nitric oxide
			- tumor necrosis factor alpha
			- p53 and other relevant proteins
			- pro/anti-inflammatory interleukins
			- antioxidants to block reactive oxygen species
			- white blood cells
			- B/T cells
			- NK cells
			- growth factors
			- oncogenes and anti-cancer genes

	- remove/reduce heavy metals like lead/cadmium
		- chlorella
		- cilantro 
		- avoid foods that can have higher levels of lead/cadmium than other foods (unless the manufacturer explicitly removes them)
			- basil, oregano, thyme, rice, fruit juice, coffee, chocolate
		- these foods were more often found to have safer levels of lead/cadmium
			- black pepper, coriander/cilantro, curry powder, garlic powder, saffron, sesame seeds

	- specific compounds for reducing factors in specific cancers
		- a formulation of boswellic acid, betaine, and myo-inositol helped reduce mammary density, a risk factor for breast cancer
		- coumarins
			- Citrus fruits are high in secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, limonoids, and coumarins, which are associated with a reduced risk of cancer
			- however citrus juices were also associated with higher risk of non-melanoma skin cancer https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33946526/
		- avoid animal protein during cancer treatment
			- a low protein diet with vegetable protein delayed tumor growth

	- reduce inflammation
		- Bromelain, cinnamon, berberine, chaga/maitake/reishi/shiitake, algae, fucoidan, magnesium, arginine, glucosamine, coq10, grape seed, fenugreek, taurine, propolis/honey/royal jelly (chrysin from pollen), ginger, indole carbinol, turmeric, ALA, NAC, pomegranate, chamomile, ginseng, zinc, aloe, dandelion, glutamine, olive leaf, nettle, vitamin c, resveratrol, ginkgo, Ashwagandha

	- antioxidants (to reduce negative impact of Reactive Oxygen Species)
		- medicines: N-acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, and dexamethasone
		- antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C powder, vitamin E, copper, zinc, selenium, glutathione, alpha lipoic acid (spinach, broccoli, tomatoes)
		- an antioxidant that helps protect your cells against the effects of free radicals
		- free radicals are molecules produced when your body breaks down food or is exposed to tobacco smoke and radiation from the sun, X-rays or other sources
		- Free radicals might play a role in heart disease, cancer and other diseases
		- Your body's cells naturally produce some powerful antioxidants, such as alpha lipoic acid and glutathione. 
			- The foods you eat supply other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E. 
			- Plants are full of compounds known as phytochemicals—literally, "plant chemicals"—many of which seem to have antioxidant properties as well. 
			- For example, after vitamin C has "quenched" a free radical by donating electrons to it, a phytochemical called hesperetin (found in oranges and other citrus fruits) restores the vitamin C to its active antioxidant form. Carotenoids (such as lycopene in tomatoes and lutein in kale) and flavonoids (such as flavanols in cocoa, anthocyanins in blueberries, quercetin in apples and onions, and catechins in green tea) are also antioxidants

	- avoid vitamin deficiencies/overdoses, and avoid vitamin antagonists which can cause deficiencies
		- https://return2health.com.au/articles/vitamin-mineral-antagonists
		- avoid when correcting vitamin deficiencies:
			- anti-convulsants (Barbituates, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Primidone, Valproic Acid, Zonisamide), birth control/estrogen, aminopterin, antibiotics, some anti-inflammatory agents, blood pressure medications/diuretics, metformin, alcohol, chlorogenic acid, caffeine/coffee/tea, raw fish, aspirin
		- calcium binders/antagonists: avoid excess oxalic acid, which is present in too-large amounts in spinach, rhubarb, beets and beet greens, Swiss chard and chocolate
		- vitamin a antagonists (nitrosamines, air pollutants, mineral oil, Blood-thinning medications and other drugs, including aspirin, phenobarbitol, arsenicals and dicumarol)
		- vitamin k antagonists (antibiotics, dicumarol and hydrocoumarol, which are used by medical people to relieve thrombosis (abnormal formation of blood clots in the blood vessels)
		- vitamin c antagonists (cigarette smoke, ammonium chloride, stribesterol, thiouracil, atropine, barbituates, antihistamines, alcohol, stressors such as surgery or extreme temperatures)
		- thiamine antagonists (ortho/para-hydroxyphenols, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, tannic acid, quercetin and rutin)
		- b vitamin antagonists:
			- alcohol
			- folate deficiency
			- Cortisone
			- chloroalanine, acetylenic compounds (e.g. propargylglycine) and vinylic compounds (e.g. vinylglycine), α-methyl and amino-oxy substrate analogs (e.g. α-methylglutamate)
			- Levothyroxine (pyridoxal-5-phosphate)
			- The inactive form pyridoxine competitively inhibits the active pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (symptoms of vitamin B6 supplementation in the pyridoxine form can mimic those of vitamin B6 deficiency, an effect which can be avoided by supplementing with P5P instead)
			- AlaP (alanine phosphonate) inhibits alanine racemases, but its lack of specificity has prompted further designs of ALR inhibitors
			- Gabaculine and Vigabatrin inhibit GABA aminotransferase
			- Canaline and 5-fluoromethylornithine inhibit ornithine aminotransferase
			- Amino-oxy SAM inhibits ACC synthase
			- egg whites (avidin)
			- antifolate dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (antimicrobial trimethoprim, the antiprotozoal pyrimethamine and the chemotherapy drug methotrexate, and the sulfonamides (competitive inhibitors of 4-aminobenzoic acid in the reactions of dihydropteroate synthetase))
			- Valproic acid/valproate, amoxicillin, erythromycin, methotrexate and pyrimethamine, proton pump inhibitors, h2 inhibitors, metformin, colchicine, extended-release potassium products, and antibiotics such as gentamicin, neomycin and tobramycin, Anti-seizure medications (phenobarbital, pregabalin, primidone and topiramate)

	- inhibit bacteria/fungi/viruses that cause cancer (EBV, HPV, Herpes, Hepatitis)
		- fungi
			- wherever fungi can cause cancer, they can often be inhibited by antifungal compounds such as:
				- holy basil (has eugenol, which disrupts fungal cell wall) and citicoline
					- Holy basil might lower thyroxine levels. In theory, this could worsen hypothyroidism (this might also interfere with inhibiting PCNA)
				- other substances commonly found in antifungal supplements:
					- oregano (thymol, carvacrol), undecylenic acid, pau d'arco (lapachol), black walnut, garlic, olive leaf, elderberry, grape seed, danshen, chinese skullcap (baicalen), caprylic acid, turmeric, ginger, sitosterol, neem, jatoba, beta-glucanase, hemicellulase, fulvic acid, licorice, star anise, cordyceps, reishi, ashwagandha, quercetin, lactic acid-producing bacteria, bacillus subtilis, wormwood, artemisin, apigenin, lactoferrin, horopito (polgodial)
		- bacteria
			- Helicobacter pylori
				- the following are commonly found in Helicobacter pylori supplements, but the activity of these is unclear
					- uncaria tomentosa (cat's claw), lactobacillus reuteri, green tea, licorice, berberine, bismuth citrate, mastic gum, broccoli sprouts, zinc
					- Lactobacillus Reuteri Pylopass, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Lactobacillus Salivarius Lactobacillus Casei, Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, Lactococcus Lactis, Bifidobacterium Longum, Bifidobacterium Bifidum, Bifidobacterium Breve
					- probiotics/wine/beer, pepto bismol, sodium butyrate, saccharomyces boulardii
		- viruses
			- Hepatitis B/C
				- the following are commonly found in liver supplements, but the activity of these is unclear
					- reishi, cordyceps, milk thistle, NAC, schisandra, irish sea moss, black cumin seed oil, burdock, bladderwrack, black pepper, turmeric, beet root, artichoke leaf, chanca piedra, dandelion, choline, chicory, yarrow, jujube, celery, ginger, alfalfa, caper bush, arjuna, tamarisk, black nightshade, cassia occidentalis, zinc, L-methionine, feverfew, grape seed, yellow dock root, raspberry, berberine HCL, l-cysteine HCL, rutin, amla 
					- nattokinase/serrapeptase are also found in liver supplements, but have some cardiac/blood pressure side effects
					- enzymes like papain/bromelain are also found in liver supplements, possibly to reduce the work of the liver
				- alpha lipoic acid: regenerates liver tissue, reverse the complications of diabetes mellitus, slow or stop the growth of cancer cells, and chelate heavy metals
				- Licorice root contains an active compound called glycyrrhizic acid, which may help reduce inflammation in the liver and regenerate damaged liver cells
					- licorice impacts the heart and blood potassium negatively so avoid licorice where possible
				- supplements associated with liver cirrhosis treatment:
					- spironolactone, thiamine, caffeine/coffee, NAC, fish oil, glutathione, sea buckthorn, cocoa, danshen, astragalus, selenium, taurine, l-carnitine, Bacillus Coagulans, L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate, Casein Protein, choline, peony, branched-chain amino acids
				- avoid
					- a damaged liver is stressed by excess iron, niacin, and vitamin A (the retinol type)

			- HPV
				- factors
					- oncoproteins E6/E7 are involved in HPV carcinogenic activity
						- HPV protein E6 binds to p53 tumor suppressor and inhibits it, and HPV protein E7 targets the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
					- when mRNA genes UBE2L3 and CYP1A1 are over-expressed or activated, HPV activity is suppressed
					- when IFN-β is suppressed, HPV activity is suppressed
				- suppressors
					- AHCC
						- suppression of the IFN-β level to less than 20 pg/ml correlated with clearance of HPV infections
						- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35814366/
					- indole-3-carbinol
						- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35678668/
						- I3C induces the mRNA Overexpression of UBE2L3 gene and Cell Proliferation Arrest
						- I3C is a natural AhR ligand (AHR reduces tumor growth and impacts UBE2L3 gene, which impacts HPV proteins E6/7)
						- HPV virus oncoprotein E6 binds to p53, resulting in its degradation and allowing uncontrolled cell proliferation
						- HPV E7 protein maintains host cell differentiation by targeting retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
						- The host cell can ubiquitinate E6 and E7 through UBE2L3 gene, whose expression depends on the interaction between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) with Xenobiotic Responsive Elements (XREs) located in the UBE2L3 gene promoter
						- We found that I3C promotes the activation of AhR and decreases cell proliferation, possibly through UBE2L3 mRNA induction, which would result in the ubiquitination of HPV E7
			- EBV
				- green tea suppresses EBV
					- EGCG, a polyphenol in green tea, has shown in a study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA, gene transcription, and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV lytic genes Zta, Rta, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by Rta), however, the highly stable EBNA-1 gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein–Barr_virus
				- EBV causes Multiple Sclerosis, and can also cause cancer by mutating certain genes
					- EBV-associated cancers are mainly lymphomas derived from B cells and T cells (Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)) and carcinomas derived from epithelial cells (nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma). EBV can induce oncogenesis in its host cell by activating various signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), Janus kinase/signal transducer and transcription activator (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and Wnt/β-catenin, which are regulated by EBV-encoded proteins and noncoding RNA
					- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868022/
					- EBV infected B-cells have been shown to reside within the brain lesions of multiple sclerosis patients
					- It has been found that EBNA1 may induce chromosomal breakage in the 11th chromosome, specifically in the 11q23 region between the FAM55D gene and FAM55B, which EBNA-1 appears to have a high affinity for due to its DNA-binding domain having an interest in a specific palindromic repeat in this section of the genome. While the cause and exact mechanism for this is unknown, the byproduct results in errors and breakage of the chromosomal structure as cells stemming from the line of the tainted genome undergo mitosis. Since genes in this area have been implicated in leukemia and is home to a tumor suppressor gene (such as tumor suppressors p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX activated by ATM serine/threonine kinase) that is modified or not present in most tumor gene expression, it's been hypothesized that breakage in this area is the main culprit behind the cancers that EBV increases the chance of.
					- ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)
						- a defect in ATM has severe consequences in repairing certain types of damage to DNA, and cancer may result from improper repair
				- Therapy/drug							Target					Function																		Cancer/disease

        	- triggers the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
        	- In contrast to the cytotoxicity of betulinic acid against a variety of cancer types, normal cells and tissue are relatively resistant to betulinic acid, pointing to a therapeutic window.
 		- propolis 
			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9499605/
			- Anticancer activity of propolis and its compounds relies on various mechanisms: 
				- cell-cycle arrest and attenuation of cancer cells proliferation, reduction in the number of cancer stem cells, induction of apoptosis, modulation of oncogene signaling pathways, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, prevention of metastasis, anti-angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory effects accompanied by the modulation of the tumor microenvironment (by modifying macrophage activation and polarization), epigenetic regulation, antiviral and bactericidal activities, modulation of gut microbiota, and attenuation of chemotherapy-induced deleterious side effects. 
				- Ingredients from propolis also ”sensitize“ cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, likely by blocking the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB).
		- chicory 
			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912540/
			- Diet-induced gene expression profiles were analyzed in the liver, ileum enterocytes and caecum of mice after 30 days of daily ingestion of aqueous extracts of Chic, Fru, CGA or STL solutions. 
			- A total of 57 profiles were found differentially expressed during the chicory diet in these different tissues
			- A first group of nine DEGs, modified by the chicory diet, is involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, and their deregulation suggests a cell growth arrest and a putative anti-cancer effect
		- Uncaria tomentosa

	- inhibit angiogenesis
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor (angiogenesis is formation of new blood vessels which can feed tumors)
		- Some common components of human diets also act as mild angiogenesis inhibitors and have therefore been proposed for angioprevention, the prevention of metastasis through the inhibition of angiogenesis. In particular, the following foods contain significant inhibitors and have been suggested as part of a healthy diet for this and other benefits:
			- Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) extract	
			- Liquorice (glycyrrhizic acid)	
			- Red wine (resveratrol)	
			- Antiangiogenic phytochemicals and medicinal herbs	
			- Royal Jelly (Queen bee acid)	
			- Green tea (catechins)	
			- Soy products such as tofu and tempeh, (which contain the inhibitor "genistein")	
			- Maitake mushrooms (via inhibition of VEGF)	
			- Lingzhi mushrooms (via inhibition of VEGF and TGF-beta)	
			- Trametes versicolor mushrooms (Polysaccharide-K. .  
			- Phellinus linteus mushroom. (via active substance Interfungins A inhibition of glycation)	
			- Agaricus subrufescens mushrooms (contain the inhibitors sodium pyroglutamate and ergosterol.	
			- Withaferin A 

	- inhibition of various cancer-progressing pathways
		- inhibit mevalonate pathway, inhibit Ras prenylation, decrease activation of Ras and downstream signaling pathways (Erk, rS6 and eIF4E), effectively targeting the MEK and other signaling pathways
			- Atorvastatin alone dose-dependently inhibits growth and survival of multiple glioblastoma cell lines
			- statins like atorvastatin exert anticancer activity via inhibiting the mevalonate pathway

	- induce/activate/promote DNA repair (associated substances that help with DNA repair)
		- avoid excess bile acids, which can damage DNA
		- Uncaria tomentosa
			- 80% lower levels of growth and increased apoptosis compared to vehicle controls. Treatment with ethanolic extracts of Uncaria tomentosa were much more effective than treatment with aqueous extracts. U. tomentosa was also shown to inhibit B16-BL6 cell growth in C57/bl mice in vivo. Mice injected with both the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of U. tomentosa showed a 59 ± 13% decrease in B16-BL6 tumour weight and a 40 ± 9% decrease in tumour size. Histochemical analysis of the B16-BL6 tumours showed a strong reduction in the Ki-67 cell proliferation marker in U. tomentosa-treated mice and a small, but insignificant increase in terminal transferase dUTP nick labelling (TUNEL) staining. Furthermore, U. tomentosa extracts reduced angiogenic markers and reduced the infiltration of T cells into the tumours
			- black garlic rich in S-allylcystein, polyphenols from cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa), devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens), camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia), and blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum), and citrus fruit extracts rich in hesperidin, have similar or greater effects than other, more extensively studied extracts such as tea and cocoa
				- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30012980/
			- Phytochemicals in Uncaria tomentosa root bark include oxindole and indole alkaloids, glycosides, organic acids, proanthocyanidins, sterols, triterpenes, tannins, polyphenols, catechins, rhynchophylline, and beta-sitosterol
		- grapeseed
			- Rich in polyphenols, especially oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), grapeseed extract contains powerful phytochemicals whose antioxidant power is 20 times greater than vitamin E and 50 times greater than vitamin C. They play a role in several cancer-associated genes, and research links OPCs with a reduced risk of colorectal and other cancers. Grapeseed extract also protects against the accumulation of age-related DNA damage in the central nervous system and various brain regions–critical in lowering the likelihood of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s. These potent antioxidants are found mainly in red and black grapes, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries
		- alpha-lipoic acid 
			- reduced DNA damage from chemicals, especially hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing industrial toxin. In other research, alpha-lipoic acid significantly decreased DNA damage from alcohol–when alcohol is metabolized, it forms toxic compounds that harm DNA and, over time, can lead to cell death and cancer. Red meat and organ meats are the highest sources
		- CoQ10 
			- enhances recovery from DNA damage to lymphocytes—white blood cells critical for healthy immune function. CoQ10 can also mitigate DNA damage involved in the development of cardiovascular disease, and research suggests people with heart disease have significantly lower levels of CoQ10. Organ meats, beef, chicken and fatty fish are the richest sources
		- sulforaphane
			- triggering a specific family of enzymes involved in the replication of DNA, and a high intake of sulforaphane is linked with greater protection against DNA strand breaks and lower rates of cancer
		- selenium
			- prevents oxidative damage to DNA and boosts the activity of enzymes and pathways involved in DNA repair; some research suggests it may also benefit people who carry the BRCA1 and BRAC2 carriers–genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast, prostate, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Meat, seafood, eggs and some nuts—especially Brazil nuts—are the richest sources
		- carotenoids
			- carotenoids - lycopene, lutein, astaxanthin and zeaxanthin - have consistently been shown to lessen oxidative stress, significantly reduce DNA damage and enhance DNA repair
				- Lutein, astaxanthin and zeaxanthin are especially protective against harmful UV radiation (including sunlight), minimizing DNA damage and prompting repair. 
				- Tomatoes, leafy greens, egg yolks and dark orange fruits and vegetables are high in lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin; astaxanthin—found mainly in salmon, shrimp
		- N-acetylcysteine 
			- is necessary for the production of glutathione — the body’s “master antioxidant” that fights free radical damage and protects DNA. NAC may mitigate genetic changes involved in the development of cancer, and many studies suggest it significantly lessens the risk of various kinds of cancer. It’s also protective against lead and other heavy metals—important, since heavy metal exposure can trigger double strand breaks (the most serious types of DNA damage) and hamper subsequent repair. NAC occurs as cysteine in chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese and other high protein foods
		- fisetin (apples, strawberries)
			- increase apoptosis by blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
				- In many cancers, this pathway is overactive, thus reducing apoptosis and allowing proliferation
			- Fisetin has roughly twice the senolytic potency as quercetin
			- anti-proliferative agent, interfering with the cell cycle in several ways. Like some other flavonoids, it has been found in lab studies to be a topoisomerase inhibitor, which may turn out to be a carcinogenic activity or an anti-cancer activity
			- inhibits the activity of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The anti-inflammatory action is due to deacylation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB by sirtuin 1
			- upregulate glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant.	 It has direct activity as a reducing agent, chemically reacting with reactive oxygen species to neutralize them. Studies suggest that it lodges in cell membranes and prevents oxidative damage to lipids in the cell membrane	
		- rapamycin
			- rapamycin as immunosuppressive agent enabled us to understand its mechanism of action. It inhibits T-cell proliferation and proliferative responses induced by several cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IGF, PDGF, and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), inhibiting angiogenesis and therefore tumor growth
		- silymarin (milk thistle)
			- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34611448/
			- Silibinin also has a number of potential mechanisms that could benefit the skin. These include chemoprotective effects from environmental toxins, anti-inflammatory effects, protection from UV induced photocarcinogenesis, protection from sunburn, protection from UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia, and DNA repair for UV induced DNA damage (double strand breaks)

				- ahcc
					- AHCC is thought to modulate tumor immune surveillance by regulating innate and adaptive immune system responses. The compound may act as a biological response modifier by enhancing natural killer cell activity, interleukin 12 (IL-12) and tumor immunity production, and spleen cell proliferation and cytokine production
					- release of small bioactive molecules that act as nontoxic agonists for toll-like receptors (TLRs), specifically TLR-4, initiating a systemic anti-inflammatory response. AHCC is believed to bind to TLR-2 and TLR-4, and act as an immune modulator. as Immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells will produce cytokines by either cytokine stimulation by dendritic cells or ligand binding to TLRs.

   			- withaferin A (ashwagandha)
		- inhibit PCNA
			- inhibit bacterial/eukaryal DNA clamps
				- Inhibitors of bacterial (β-clamp) and eukaryal DNA clamps can also inhibit proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (B clamps and PCNA are structurally similar)

			- increase T2AA to inhibit PCNA
				- T2AA is a small molecule analog of triiodothyronine (T3) that inhibits translesion DNA synthesis (Punchihewa et al., 2012). 
				- T2AA was found to inhibit PCNA interaction with p21 and Polδ by binding in the PIP site
				- thyroid hormone 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3) is a potent inhibitor of the PCNA–PIP peptide interaction

			- modified peptides and small molecule inhibitors
			- natural products (Griselimycin or cyclohexyl-Griselimycin)
			- modified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (modified NSAIDs)
				- carprofen, bromfenac, and vedaprofen bound to subsite 1 on β-clamp. 
				- These molecules bury a hydrophobic group into subsite 1 and an aromatic group into an adjacent region. 
				- The lack of interaction with subsite 2 is likely the reason for the relatively weak interaction with β-clamp (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC > 1,250 μM) and relatively weak inhibition as compared to antibiotics such as ampicillin (MIC = 125 μM) and Chloramphenicol

			- Retinoblastoma protein (pRb). pRb was the first tumor-suppressor protein discovered in human retinoblastoma; however, recent evidence has also implicated pRb as a tumor-survival factor. RB1 gene is a gatekeeper gene that blocks cell proliferation, regulates cell division and cell death. Specifically pRb prevents the cell cycle progression from G1 phase into the S phase by binding to E2F and repressing the necessary gene transcription. This prevents the cell from replicating its DNA if there is damage.
			
			- p53. TP53, a caretaker gene, encodes the protein p53, which is nicknamed "the guardian of the genome". p53 has many different functions in the cell including DNA repair, inducing apoptosis, transcription, and regulating the cell cycle. Mutated p53 is involved in many human cancers, of the 6.5 million cancer diagnoses each year about 37% are connected to p53 mutations. This makes it a popular target for new cancer therapies. Homozygous loss of p53 is found in 65% of colon cancers, 30–50% of breast cancers, and 50% of lung cancers. Mutated p53 is also involved in the pathophysiology of leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, and neurogenic tumors. Abnormalities of the p53 gene can be inherited in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which increases the risk of developing various types of cancers.
			
			- BCL2. BCL2 is a family of proteins that are involved in either inducing or inhibiting apoptosis. The main function is involved in maintaining the composition of the mitochondria membrane, and preventing cytochrome c release into the cytosol. When cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria it starts a signaling cascade to begin apoptosis.	
			
			- SWI/SNF. SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeling complex, which is lost in about 20% of tumors. The complex consists of 10-15 subunits encoded by 20 different genes. Mutations in the individual complexes can lead to misfolding, which compromises the ability of the complex to work together as a whole. SWI/SNF has the ability move nucleosomes, which condenses DNA, allowing for transcription or block transcription from occurring for certain genes. Mutating this ability could cause genes to be turned on or off at the wrong times.

						- is a steroidal lactone that is found to down regulate expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins, induce accumulation of p53, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest, alters the expression levels of apoptotic markers Bcl2, Bax and caspase3, and tumor volume
						- Anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity of withaferin A is due to the inhibition of chymotrypsin
						- induction of apoptosis is due to the inhibition of protein kinase C (also done by tamoxifen)
						- inhibits B/T cells
							- immunosuppressive effects on mouse thymocytes as well as human B and T lymphocytes by withaferin A and a related steroid lactone withanolide E
								- At very low concentrations, these molecules inhibit the E rosette and EAC rosette formation by normal B and T lymphocytes

							- A recent study had elaborated the role of Withaferin in inhibition of Zap70 kinase activity, which is critical for T-cell function in health and disease
						- inhibits tumor growth through ATP-independent inhibition of heat shock protein 90 HSP90
						- increases Mcl-1 expression levels inducing apoptosis
						- inhibit vimentin
							- binds to/inhibits vimentin
								- binds to/inhibits intermediate filament protein, vimentin, by covalently modifying its highly conserved cysteine residue in alpha-helical coiled 2B domain
							- aggregates vimentin with F-actin to cause apoptosis
								- Withaferin A causes aggregation of vimentin to colocalize with F-actin, leading to apoptosis
								- Actin is required for various cellular processes including oriented growth, adhesion and migration
								- Withaferin A can alter cytoskeleton architecture by covalently binding to multifunctional adaptor protein annexin II and by stimulating the basal F-actin cross linking activity
							- downregulates vimentin expression
								- Withaferin A downregulates vimentin expression, leading to structural perturbation of intermediary filaments
								- Cancer cells express enhanced vimentin expression and correlates with the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, poor prognosis and decreased survival rate
							- degrades vimentin
								- caspase-dependent degradation of vimentin by withaferin A was observed
						- increases the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and MAPK 
						- increases the expression of tumor suppressor p53, Notch 2 and Notch 4, down-regulates the expression of ERα, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell migration and growth
							- Notch signaling plays a significant role in the development of colon cancer
							- inhibition of Notch-mediated prosurvival by withaferin A facilitates c-Jun-NH2-kinase-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines
						- inhibits cell motility and invasion capacity of cancer cells through MMP-2 by induction of Par-4

			- Inositol is a small molecule structurally similar to glucose that is involved in cellular signalling. 
				- Research shows that animals treated with inositol have significantly fewer demyelinating lesions
			- lion’s mane increases the rate of myelination production, and the process of myelination begins earlier in the presence of the mushroom
			- luteolin, quercetin and fisetin significantly decrease myelin phagocytosis and may be able to limit the demyelination process during multiple sclerosis
			- Running has also been shown to increase myelination and delay the progression of demyelination, and therefore delays the progression of Alzheimer’s disease
				- exercise increases mitochondrial activity, which then increases myelination in the brain 
			- Vitamin D receptor boosts the regeneration of myelin
			- vitamin k2 has also been shown to support myelin
			- choline - causes clots
			- vitamin b12, folate, S-adenosylmethionine, biotin, vitamin b5

			- monolaurin
				- Monolaurin also has antiviral properties which are effective in fighting off multiple types of infections common in patients with MS. 
				- Viral infections usually trigger inflammation and over production of T-cells, which can cause the myelin sheath to break down.
			- vitamin d
			- keto diet
			- copper
				- The myelin sheath regenerates using lipids, which can only be created using a copper-dependent enzyme. Without this assistance, other nutrients cannot do their job. Copper is found in lentils, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds

	- gout
		- try low purine diet to see if it helps more than alkaline diet
		- Milk. Some early research suggests that drinking skim milk may help reduce uric acid and gout flare-ups. It speeds up the excretion of uric acid in your urine and also reduces your bodys inflammatory response to uric acid crystals in your joints.
		- Cherries. Scientists are currently researching the benefits of cherries and cherry juice for managing gout symptoms, and early results are promising. Cherries have known anti-inflammatory properties, and they may also help reduce uric acid in your body.
		- Coffee. You may have heard that coffee is acidic, but the type of acid in coffee is very different from uric acid. In fact, drinking coffee daily can reduce your uric acid levels by several means. It slows the breakdown of purine into uric acid and speeds the rate of excretion.
		- Water. People who drink five to eight glasses of water a day are less likely to experience gout symptoms. This makes sense since your kidneys use water to excrete uric acid in your urine. Water is also good for kidney health. Impaired kidney function is one factor that can contribute to gout.
		- Peanuts, brown bread, and fruit also appear protective
