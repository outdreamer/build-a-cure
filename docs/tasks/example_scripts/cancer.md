- various mechanisms of action of inhibiting cancer (and associated anti-tumor substances)

    - the point of these lists is to group substances with functions/effects/structures that either inhibit specific processes that favor cancer, or activate specific processes that suppress/reduce cancer in specific cells/genes/pathways
	    - this includes processes such as:
    		- angiogenesis, prenylation, phosphorylation, methylation, mutation, activation, oxidation, protein ubiquitination

    - antioxidants (to reduce negative impact of Reactive Oxygen Species)
    	- vitamin C powder
    	- alpha lipoic acid

	- inhibit bacteria/fungi/viruses that cause cancer (EBV, HPV, Herpes, Hepatitis)
		- fungi
			- wherever fungi can cause cancer, they can often be inhibited by antifungal compounds such as:
				- holy basil (has eugenol, which disrupts fungal cell wall) and citicoline
				- other substances commonly found in antifungal supplements:
					- oregano (thymol, carvacrol), undecylenic acid, pau d'arco, black walnut, garlic, olive leaf, elderberry, grape seed, danshen, chinese skullcap (baicalen), caprylic acid, turmeric, ginger, sitosterol, neem, jatoba, beta-glucanase, hemicellulase, fulvic acid, licorice, star anise, cordyceps, reishi, ashwagandha, quercetin, lactic acid-producing bacteria, bacillus subtilis, wormwood, artemisin, apigenin, lactoferrin
		- bacteria
			- Helicobacter pylori
				- the following are commonly found in Helicobacter pylori supplements, but the activity of these is unclear
					- uncaria tomentosa (cat's claw), lactobacillus reuteri, green tea, licorice, berberine, bismuth citrate, mastic gum, broccoli sprouts, zinc
					- Lactobacillus Reuteri Pylopass, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Lactobacillus Salivarius Lactobacillus Casei, Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, Lactococcus Lactis, Bifidobacterium Longum, Bifidobacterium Bifidum, Bifidobacterium Breve
		- viruses
			- Hepatitis B/C
				- the following are commonly found in liver supplements, but the activity of these is unclear
					- reishi, cordyceps, milk thistle, NAC, schisandra, irish sea moss, black cumin seed oil, burdock, bladderwrack, black pepper, turmeric, beet root, artichoke leaf, chanca piedra, dandelion, choline, chicory, yarrow, jujube, celery, ginger, alfalfa, caper bush, arjuna, tamarisk, black nightshade, cassia occidentalis, zinc, L-methionine, feverfew, grape seed, yellow dock root, raspberry, berberine HCL, l-cysteine HCL, rutin, amla 
					- nattokinase/serrapeptase are also found in liver supplements, but have some cardiac/blood pressure side effects
					- enzymes like papain/bromelain are also found in liver supplements, possibly to reduce the work of the liver
			- HPV
				- factors
					- oncoproteins E6/E7 are involved in HPV carcinogenic activity
						- HPV protein E6 binds to p53 tumor suppressor and inhibits it, and HPV protein E7 targets the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
					- when mRNA genes UBE2L3 and CYP1A1 are over-expressed or activated, HPV activity is suppressed
					- when IFN-β is suppressed, HPV activity is suppressed
				- suppressors
					- AHCC
						- suppression of the IFN-β level to less than 20 pg/ml correlated with clearance of HPV infections
						- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35814366/
					- indole-3-carbinol
						- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35678668/
						- I3C induces the mRNA Overexpression of UBE2L3 gene and Cell Proliferation Arrest
						- I3C is a natural AhR ligand (AHR reduces tumor growth and impacts UBE2L3 gene, which impacts HPV proteins E6/7)
						- HPV virus oncoprotein E6 binds to p53, resulting in its degradation and allowing uncontrolled cell proliferation
						- HPV E7 protein maintains host cell differentiation by targeting retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
						- The host cell can ubiquitinate E6 and E7 through UBE2L3 gene, whose expression depends on the interaction between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) with Xenobiotic Responsive Elements (XREs) located in the UBE2L3 gene promoter
						- We found that I3C promotes the activation of AhR and decreases cell proliferation, possibly through UBE2L3 mRNA induction, which would result in the ubiquitination of HPV E7
			- EBV
				- green tea suppresses EBV
					- EGCG, a polyphenol in green tea, has shown in a study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA, gene transcription, and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV lytic genes Zta, Rta, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by Rta), however, the highly stable EBNA-1 gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein–Barr_virus
				- EBV causes Multiple Sclerosis, and can also cause cancer by mutating certain genes
					- EBV-associated cancers are mainly lymphomas derived from B cells and T cells (Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)) and carcinomas derived from epithelial cells (nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma). EBV can induce oncogenesis in its host cell by activating various signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), Janus kinase/signal transducer and transcription activator (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and Wnt/β-catenin, which are regulated by EBV-encoded proteins and noncoding RNA
					- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868022/
					- EBV infected B-cells have been shown to reside within the brain lesions of multiple sclerosis patients
					- It has been found that EBNA1 may induce chromosomal breakage in the 11th chromosome, specifically in the 11q23 region between the FAM55D gene and FAM55B, which EBNA-1 appears to have a high affinity for due to its DNA-binding domain having an interest in a specific palindromic repeat in this section of the genome. While the cause and exact mechanism for this is unknown, the byproduct results in errors and breakage of the chromosomal structure as cells stemming from the line of the tainted genome undergo mitosis. Since genes in this area have been implicated in leukemia and is home to a tumor suppressor gene (such as tumor suppressors p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX activated by ATM serine/threonine kinase) that is modified or not present in most tumor gene expression, it's been hypothesized that breakage in this area is the main culprit behind the cancers that EBV increases the chance of.
					- ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)
						- a defect in ATM has severe consequences in repairing certain types of damage to DNA, and cancer may result from improper repair

	- induce apoptosis
 		- propolis 
			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9499605/
			- Anticancer activity of propolis and its compounds relies on various mechanisms: 
				- cell-cycle arrest and attenuation of cancer cells proliferation, reduction in the number of cancer stem cells, induction of apoptosis, modulation of oncogene signaling pathways, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, prevention of metastasis, anti-angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory effects accompanied by the modulation of the tumor microenvironment (by modifying macrophage activation and polarization), epigenetic regulation, antiviral and bactericidal activities, modulation of gut microbiota, and attenuation of chemotherapy-induced deleterious side effects. 
				- Ingredients from propolis also ”sensitize“ cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, likely by blocking the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB).
		- chicory 
			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912540/
			- Diet-induced gene expression profiles were analyzed in the liver, ileum enterocytes and caecum of mice after 30 days of daily ingestion of aqueous extracts of Chic, Fru, CGA or STL solutions. 
			- A total of 57 profiles were found differentially expressed during the chicory diet in these different tissues

	- inhibit angiogenesis
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor (angiogenesis is formation of new blood vessels which can feed tumors)
		- Some common components of human diets also act as mild angiogenesis inhibitors and have therefore been proposed for angioprevention, the prevention of metastasis through the inhibition of angiogenesis. In particular, the following foods contain significant inhibitors and have been suggested as part of a healthy diet for this and other benefits:
			- Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) extract	
			- Liquorice (glycyrrhizic acid)	
			- Red wine (resveratrol)	
			- Antiangiogenic phytochemicals and medicinal herbs	
			- Royal Jelly (Queen bee acid)

			- Atorvastatin alone dose-dependently inhibits growth and survival of multiple glioblastoma cell lines
			- statins like atorvastatin exert anticancer activity via inhibiting the mevalonate pathway

	- induce/activate/promote DNA repair (associated substances that help with DNA repair)
		- Uncaria tomentosa
			- 80% lower levels of growth and increased apoptosis compared to vehicle controls. Treatment with ethanolic extracts of Uncaria tomentosa were much more effective than treatment with aqueous extracts. U. tomentosa was also shown to inhibit B16-BL6 cell growth in C57/bl mice in vivo. Mice injected with both the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of U. tomentosa showed a 59 ± 13% decrease in B16-BL6 tumour weight and a 40 ± 9% decrease in tumour size. Histochemical analysis of the B16-BL6 tumours showed a strong reduction in the Ki-67 cell proliferation marker in U. tomentosa-treated mice and a small, but insignificant increase in terminal transferase dUTP nick labelling (TUNEL) staining. Furthermore, U. tomentosa extracts reduced angiogenic markers and reduced the infiltration of T cells into the tumours
			- black garlic rich in S-allylcystein, polyphenols from cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa), devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens), camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia), and blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum), and citrus fruit extracts rich in hesperidin, have similar or greater effects than other, more extensively studied extracts such as tea and cocoa
				- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30012980/
			- Phytochemicals in Uncaria tomentosa root bark include oxindole and indole alkaloids, glycosides, organic acids, proanthocyanidins, sterols, triterpenes, tannins, polyphenols, catechins, rhynchophylline, and beta-sitosterol
		- grapeseed
			- Rich in polyphenols, especially oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), grapeseed extract contains powerful phytochemicals whose antioxidant power is 20 times greater than vitamin E and 50 times greater than vitamin C. They play a role in several cancer-associated genes, and research links OPCs with a reduced risk of colorectal and other cancers. Grapeseed extract also protects against the accumulation of age-related DNA damage in the central nervous system and various brain regions–critical in lowering the likelihood of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s. These potent antioxidants are found mainly in red and black grapes, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries
		- alpha-lipoic acid 
			- reduced DNA damage from chemicals, especially hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing industrial toxin. In other research, alpha-lipoic acid significantly decreased DNA damage from alcohol–when alcohol is metabolized, it forms toxic compounds that harm DNA and, over time, can lead to cell death and cancer. Red meat and organ meats are the highest sources
		- CoQ10 
			- enhances recovery from DNA damage to lymphocytes—white blood cells critical for healthy immune function. CoQ10 can also mitigate DNA damage involved in the development of cardiovascular disease, and research suggests people with heart disease have significantly lower levels of CoQ10. Organ meats, beef, chicken and fatty fish are the richest sources
		- sulforaphane
			- triggering a specific family of enzymes involved in the replication of DNA, and a high intake of sulforaphane is linked with greater protection against DNA strand breaks and lower rates of cancer
		- selenium
			- prevents oxidative damage to DNA and boosts the activity of enzymes and pathways involved in DNA repair; some research suggests it may also benefit people who carry the BRCA1 and BRAC2 carriers–genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast, prostate, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Meat, seafood, eggs and some nuts—especially Brazil nuts—are the richest sources
		- carotenoids
			- carotenoids - lycopene, lutein, astaxanthin and zeaxanthin - have consistently been shown to lessen oxidative stress, significantly reduce DNA damage and enhance DNA repair
				- Lutein, astaxanthin and zeaxanthin are especially protective against harmful UV radiation (including sunlight), minimizing DNA damage and prompting repair. 
				- Tomatoes, leafy greens, egg yolks and dark orange fruits and vegetables are high in lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin; astaxanthin—found mainly in salmon, shrimp
		- N-acetylcysteine 
			- is necessary for the production of glutathione — the body’s “master antioxidant” that fights free radical damage and protects DNA. NAC may mitigate genetic changes involved in the development of cancer, and many studies suggest it significantly lessens the risk of various kinds of cancer. It’s also protective against lead and other heavy metals—important, since heavy metal exposure can trigger double strand breaks (the most serious types of DNA damage) and hamper subsequent repair. NAC occurs as cysteine in chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese and other high protein foods
		- fisetin (apples, strawberries)
			- increase apoptosis by blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
				- In many cancers, this pathway is overactive, thus reducing apoptosis and allowing proliferation
			- Fisetin has roughly twice the senolytic potency as quercetin
			- anti-proliferative agent, interfering with the cell cycle in several ways. Like some other flavonoids, it has been found in lab studies to be a topoisomerase inhibitor, which may turn out to be a carcinogenic activity or an anti-cancer activity
			- inhibits the activity of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The anti-inflammatory action is due to deacylation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB by sirtuin 1
			- upregulate glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant.	 It has direct activity as a reducing agent, chemically reacting with reactive oxygen species to neutralize them. Studies suggest that it lodges in cell membranes and prevents oxidative damage to lipids in the cell membrane	
		- rapamycin
			- rapamycin as immunosuppressive agent enabled us to understand its mechanism of action. It inhibits T-cell proliferation and proliferative responses induced by several cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IGF, PDGF, and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), inhibiting angiogenesis and therefore tumor growth

				- ahcc
					- AHCC is thought to modulate tumor immune surveillance by regulating innate and adaptive immune system responses. The compound may act as a biological response modifier by enhancing natural killer cell activity, interleukin 12 (IL-12) and tumor immunity production, and spleen cell proliferation and cytokine production
					- release of small bioactive molecules that act as nontoxic agonists for toll-like receptors (TLRs), specifically TLR-4, initiating a systemic anti-inflammatory response. AHCC is believed to bind to TLR-2 and TLR-4, and act as an immune modulator. as Immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells will produce cytokines by either cytokine stimulation by dendritic cells or ligand binding to TLRs.

   			- inhibit vimentin
   				- withaferin A (ashwagandha)
			- inhibit PCNA
				- inhibit bacterial/eukaryal DNA clamps
					- Inhibitors of bacterial (β-clamp) and eukaryal DNA clamps can also inhibit proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (B clamps and PCNA are structurally similar)
					- https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2018.00087/full#:~:text=Inhibitors%20of%20bacterial%20%28β-clamp%29%20and%20eukaryal%20DNA%20clamps%2C,inhibitors%2C%20natural%20products%2C%20and%20modified%20non-steroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drugs.
				- increase T2AA to inhibit PCNA
					- T2AA is a small molecule analog of triiodothyronine (T3) that inhibits translesion DNA synthesis (Punchihewa et al., 2012). 
					- T2AA was found to inhibit PCNA interaction with p21 and Polδ by binding in the PIP site
				- modified peptides and small molecule inhibitors
				- natural products (Griselimycin or cyclohexyl-Griselimycin)
				- modified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (modified NSAIDs)
					- carprofen, bromfenac, and vedaprofen bound to subsite 1 on β-clamp. 
					- These molecules bury a hydrophobic group into subsite 1 and an aromatic group into an adjacent region. 
					- The lack of interaction with subsite 2 is likely the reason for the relatively weak interaction with β-clamp (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC > 1,250 μM) and relatively weak inhibition as compared to antibiotics such as ampicillin (MIC = 125 μM) and Chloramphenicol

	- reduce DNA prenylation
		- atorvastatin

	- reduce DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes and increase methylation of oncogenes (DNA methyltransferases, DNMT)

	- activate DNA repair enzymes (except when using temozolomide)
		- MGMT
			- DNA repair protein, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), can confer resistance to guanine O6-alkylating agents. 
			- Therefore, inhibition of resistant MGMT protein is a practical approach to increase the anticancer effects of such alkylating agents

	- inhibit phosphorylation
		- tyrosine kinase inhibitors
			- Tyrosine kinases are enzymes responsible for the activation of many proteins by signal transduction cascades. 
			- The proteins are activated by adding a phosphate group to the protein (phosphorylation), a step that TKIs inhibit

			- Retinoblastoma protein (pRb). pRb was the first tumor-suppressor protein discovered in human retinoblastoma; however, recent evidence has also implicated pRb as a tumor-survival factor. RB1 gene is a gatekeeper gene that blocks cell proliferation, regulates cell division and cell death. Specifically pRb prevents the cell cycle progression from G1 phase into the S phase by binding to E2F and repressing the necessary gene transcription. This prevents the cell from replicating its DNA if there is damage.
			
			- p53. TP53, a caretaker gene, encodes the protein p53, which is nicknamed "the guardian of the genome". p53 has many different functions in the cell including DNA repair, inducing apoptosis, transcription, and regulating the cell cycle. Mutated p53 is involved in many human cancers, of the 6.5 million cancer diagnoses each year about 37% are connected to p53 mutations. This makes it a popular target for new cancer therapies. Homozygous loss of p53 is found in 65% of colon cancers, 30–50% of breast cancers, and 50% of lung cancers. Mutated p53 is also involved in the pathophysiology of leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, and neurogenic tumors. Abnormalities of the p53 gene can be inherited in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which increases the risk of developing various types of cancers.
			
			- BCL2. BCL2 is a family of proteins that are involved in either inducing or inhibiting apoptosis. The main function is involved in maintaining the composition of the mitochondria membrane, and preventing cytochrome c release into the cytosol. When cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria it starts a signaling cascade to begin apoptosis.	
			
			- SWI/SNF. SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeling complex, which is lost in about 20% of tumors. The complex consists of 10-15 subunits encoded by 20 different genes. Mutations in the individual complexes can lead to misfolding, which compromises the ability of the complex to work together as a whole. SWI/SNF has the ability move nucleosomes, which condenses DNA, allowing for transcription or block transcription from occurring for certain genes. Mutating this ability could cause genes to be turned on or off at the wrong times.

						- is a steroidal lactone that is found to down regulate expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins, induce accumulation of p53, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest, alters the expression levels of apoptotic markers Bcl2, Bax and caspase3, and tumor volume
						- Anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity of withaferin A is due to the inhibition of chymotrypsin
						- induction of apoptosis is due to the inhibition of protein kinase C (also done by tamoxifen)
						- inhibits B/T cells
							- immunosuppressive effects on mouse thymocytes as well as human B and T lymphocytes by withaferin A and a related steroid lactone withanolide E
								- At very low concentrations, these molecules inhibit the E rosette and EAC rosette formation by normal B and T lymphocytes
								- Withaferin A has a specific action on antigen recognition and proliferative capacity of both B and T lymphocytes
							- A recent study had elaborated the role of Withaferin in inhibition of Zap70 kinase activity, which is critical for T-cell function in health and disease
						- inhibits tumor growth through ATP-independent inhibition of heat shock protein 90 HSP90
						- increases Mcl-1 expression levels inducing apoptosis
						- inhibit vimentin
							- binds to/inhibits vimentin
								- binds to/inhibits intermediate filament protein, vimentin, by covalently modifying its highly conserved cysteine residue in alpha-helical coiled 2B domain
							- aggregates vimentin with F-actin to cause apoptosis
								- Withaferin A causes aggregation of vimentin to colocalize with F-actin, leading to apoptosis
								- Actin is required for various cellular processes including oriented growth, adhesion and migration
								- Withaferin A can alter cytoskeleton architecture by covalently binding to multifunctional adaptor protein annexin II and by stimulating the basal F-actin cross linking activity
							- downregulates vimentin expression
								- Withaferin A downregulates vimentin expression, leading to structural perturbation of intermediary filaments
								- Cancer cells express enhanced vimentin expression and correlates with the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, poor prognosis and decreased survival rate
							- degrades vimentin
								- caspase-dependent degradation of vimentin by withaferin A was observed
						- increases the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and MAPK 
						- increases the expression of tumor suppressor p53, Notch 2 and Notch 4, down-regulates the expression of ERα, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell migration and growth
							- Notch signaling plays a significant role in the development of colon cancer
							- inhibition of Notch-mediated prosurvival by withaferin A facilitates c-Jun-NH2-kinase-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines
						- inhibits cell motility and invasion capacity of cancer cells through MMP-2 by induction of Par-4
