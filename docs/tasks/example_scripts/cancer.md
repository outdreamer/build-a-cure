- various sub-intents for general intent of inhibiting cancer (and associated anti-tumor substances with sub-intents)


- useful sub-intents with associated substances

	- these are probably useful sub-intents/substances for treating cancer (assuming no liver/kidney damage which would contraindicate the harsher substances like temozolomide, disulfiram, baicelein, celastrol, quercetin, and ashwagandha), based on identifying treatments in ncbi.nlm.nih.gov articles, these are not inventions
		- some of the scripts and questions are my inventions, as in 'new useful unique thoughts, using my other inventions to analyze info', although a 'cancer-curing protocol for most cancers (such as rotating through subsets of supplements or combinations of supplemments that cover a high ratio of functionality or finding a gene that can be changed to cure most cancers while avoiding other health problems)' would be an invention (its valuable and not trivial to identify)
		- similarly, 'identifying which substances in which structures like 'combination/sequence' that inhibit/activate the structures that would reduce all relevant cancerous processes in specific cancer states/types/co-occurrence with other conditions' is an intent that, if fulfilled, would likely constitute a cancer-curing script, since the problem of cancer is largely a problem of 'not yet knowing all the impacts of each substance and the net impact of that substance when applied with other substances and in specific states of health and for specific cancer types', so identifying the 'net impact of a diet and set of supplements on these anti-cancer intents' is likely sufficient to cure cancer in many cases, except where the impact is not fully known
			- for example, for a 'brain cancer patient, with kidney failure', this might be a protocol such as 'avoid outdoor air to avoid pollution, avoid chemicals like cleaners, exercise indoors, eat coconut oil and some anti-cancer herbs like shiitake mushrooms as well as baking soda, low doses of vitamin d or cortisol at night, modified citrus pectin, and inositol, for a period such as several weeks, in order to avoid cancerous inputs', but there is no tool to identify implementations of intents or the intents themselves for specific patients, and if there was, that might constitute a cancer cure
		- this means 'iterating through genes (and then structures of genes like components/combinations) to find unnecessary ones' might be useful to determine if there is one that can be switched off without causing health problems and if it could also usefully alter cancer growth (like disabling growth factors and replacing them with less mutable alternatives)
		- this also means 'identifying coordinating as well as complementary intents' (inhibit CSC and inhibit autophagy) is useful to identify possible supplement sets fulfilling these intents that is generally useful at reducing cancer growth and identifying usefulness of 'structures of intents like rotating between intents (to keep cancer cells from adapting too successfully)' is similarly useful
		- another way to solve this problem is letting cancer patients try these drugs for a few hours or days to see if they work without risking the patients' life (a 'low-dose' strategy)
		- similarly, a script to identify what 'symptoms/reactions from a specific supplement/diet mean' (like if corticosteroids hurt you, that means you probably had heart damage) would be useful to diagnose conditions without labwork or without reliable tests/known markers which is a lot of conditions

		- if youre used to using a nightlight and/or your cancer grows more at night, try increasing your cortisol at night using high intensity exercise/stressful noises like alarms/blue light from devices/other artificial light, or substances that increase cortisol like grapefruit/citrus/caffeine/resveratrol/licorice (or steroid hormones like pregnenolone/hydrocortisone/other glucocorticoids/corticosteroids if youre otherwise healthy and can tolerate them)
			- night is when these hormones naturally decrease and when they decrease, they stop suppressing cancer cell growth (lower cortisol at night is why cancer grows more at night)
			- it should be fine to lower your cortisol in the morning with supplements/food, since your cortisol will likely increase then anyway, regardless of what else you do in the morning
			- check if youve disrupted your normal light exposure or exercise timing or vitamin D/melatonin use or other sleep-relevant variable habits/patterns, if youve changed something recently as a possible trigger of cancer, bc I got used to having continuous light exposure, and when I stopped using a nightlight, I got cancer

			- glucocorticoids are contraindicated for some cancers and in some doses/usages
			- 'increasing cortisol at night' isnt a permanent or long-term solution or a habit that you should use every day, bc cortisol at night will disrupt your circadian rhythm, but as a treatment for cancer, it could slow cancer growth enough for your morning treatments to be more effective (especially if you only occasionally increase your cortisol at night or otherwise allow your circadian rhythms to go back to normal regularly enough to get benefits from correct circadian rhythms, like immune responses in the morning)
			- be aware that licorice can cause hypertension and low blood potassium and steroids/hormones also have possibly harmful side effects in trivial/normal doses, especially if you have other health conditions like kidney/heart damage
			- some of these cortisol-increasing substances may only increase general cortisol levels or only increase cortisol when it naturally increases (in the morning), rather than at the time of use, and they may also decrease cortisol in some cases or will have a lower response of increasing cortisol only slightly (after tolerance to the substance develops), and they may only decrease cortisol up to the normal healthy level if you were deficient in cortisol, or they may only prevent the decrease of cortisol rather than increasing it, or they may only increase your cortisol levels for a few minutes or hours, rather than the whole night
			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109638/
			- fasting increases ghrelin which increases cortisol so that could be an alternative strategy if done right
			- avoid taking cortisol-lowering substances at night and only use them in the morning if possible (turmeric, chocolate, sea salt, olive oil, siberian ginseng/eleuthoro, bananas/tryptophan, mushrooms/oats/barley/beta-glucans, garlic, flaxseed/alpha-linolenic acid, ginger, onions/quercetin, asparagus/rutin/glutathione, ginkgo biloba, tyrosine, suma root, nutritional yeast, cordyceps, probiotics/prebiotics, astragalus, holy basil, NAC, tribulus, B-vitamins, zinc, bacopa, cannabis/cbd, ginseng, ashwagandha, rhodiola, lemon balm, chamomile, GABA, melatonin, vitamin D, theanine, magnolia/honokiol, phosphatidylserine/choline, schisandra, omega-3s, green tea/EGCG, vitamin C, magnesium)

	    - vitamin d 
	    	- taking this throughout the day is useful for preventing some cancer activity, which needs continuous suppression to be fully treated, otherwise it'll keep coming back when your morning vitamin d supplement wears off
	    	- eating mushrooms will help with multiple other intents (see below with shiitake/maitake/other medicinal mushrooms), but also will help bc they have vitamin d
	    	- vitamin d is also one of the few anticancer substances that doesnt inhibit EGFR which is an advantage for preventing hair loss, which might occur with many powerful anticancer substances
	    	- supplements containing resveratrol, saw palmetto, maca, curcumin, tocotrienols, ashwagandha, horsetail, astaxanthin, kelp, capsicum, Annurca apple fruits, safflower and ginseng can have beneficial effects on hair growth, without adverse effects on breast cancer patients
	    	    - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698784/
	    	- more than 4000 IU of vitamin D daily can kill you, so use a low-dose supplement if youre going to try taking it continuously all day and stay well below that limit
	    	- Atorvastatin is contraindicated with vitamin D, which changes absorption of Atorvastatin
		- energy metabolism in cancer 
			- Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), methionine (MET), Methylthioadenosine (MTA), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)
				- these have a complex relationship in cancer, where these substances can help or inhibit cancer in various states
				- many cancers only can occur bc of lost MTAP (resulting from 9p21 gene loss/deactivation), where increasing MTAP reduces cancer
				- cancer feeds off of methionine
				- SAMe can either help or inhibit cancer growth, depending on the cancer type/state
				- MTA can also either help or inhibit cancer growth
					- In healthy cells, the molecule MTA is believed to have tumor suppressing properties and regulate cell proliferation
					- However, when MTA levels were recorded above optimal working conditions, these MTA molecules appeared to have an inverse relation, promoting tumor growth and significantly increasing the proliferation of tumor cells
		- increase MTAP by activating 9p21-related genes (p14ARF, p15INK4b and CDKN2A)
			- interactive substances
				- tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A (downregulated by resveratrol)
				- curcumin inhibits MTAP, so avoid curcumin (depending on the cancer type/state, curcumin may be helpful for some cancers and harmful for others)
				    - p14ARF is downregulated by p53, so substances that decrease p53 like curcumin may be useful, for increasing p14ARF
					- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7705812/
			- these genes interact with p53 (by inhibiting mdm2 which promotes p53)
				- Dysregulation of p53 pathway in GBM is mostly due to TP53 mutation, amplification of MDM2, or loss of expression of CDKN2A-p14ARF
				- Both p16INK4a and p14ARF are involved in cell cycle regulation. p14ARF inhibits mdm2, thus promoting p53, which promotes p21 activation, which then binds and inactivates certain cyclin-CDK complexes, which would otherwise promote transcription of genes that would carry the cell through the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle
				- Loss of p14ARF by a homozygous mutation in the CDKN2A (INK4A) gene will lead to elevated levels in mdm2 and, therefore, loss of p53 function and cell cycle control
		    - Situated at 9p21 gene cluster region, p14ARF and p15INK4b anti-oncogenes have essential actions in controlling cell growth
			- MTAP loss increases MTA levels and immune checkpoint inhibitor failure in melanoma and urothelial tumors
			- Excess MTA in the TME impairs CD4+ and CD8+ T cells via ADO agonism and PRMT5 inhibition
			- PEG-MTAP delivery to MTAP−/− tumors controls tumor growth dependent of CD8+ T cells
			- MTAP and IO combination therapy is proposed for the treatment of MTAP-deficient cancers
			- Chromosomal region 9p21 containing tumor suppressors CDKN2A/B and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is one of the most frequent genetic deletions in cancer
				- 9p21 loss is correlated with reduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy
				- it is loss of MTAP that leads to reduced TIL density
				- MTAP loss causes accumulation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) both intracellularly and extracellularly and profoundly impairs T cell function via the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and by adenosine receptor agonism
				- Administration of MTA-depleting enzymes reverses this immunosuppressive effect, increasing TILs and drastically impairing tumor growth
		- increase parts of the covid immune response, which extremely reduced my brain tumor during the active immune response
			- iodine
				- The antimicrobial action of iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, and thus it is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death
			- I would try reducing and increasing interferon-gamma and TNF-α bc they can both attack and help cancer (as part of the covid immune reponse, they attacked cancer for me), so its useful to find out which function your cancer responds to, by testing both sets of substances
				- such as groups like 'astragalus/milk thistle/quercetin' vs. 'turmeric/boswellia/green tea/resveratrol/holy basil/limonene/berberine' and then a known useful mix like 'quercetin/holy basil' as they are both powerful in my experience
			- increase CD4+ T cells (astragalus, lauric acid/coconut oil) 
				- Regulatory T helper 17 cells are generated from CD4+ T cells
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4%2B_T_cells_and_antitumor_immunity
		    - increase TNF-α (astragalus)
		    	- limonene, holy basil, echinacea, and berberine all decrease TNF-α
		    	- astragalus increases TNF-α
			- increase IL-2 (ginseng, reishi, DHA, echinacea, lauric acid/coconut oil)
				- IL-2 is one of the factors increased by the covid immune response, which reduced my brain tumor
			    - ginseng, reishi, DHA increase IL-2, chlorella decreased IL-2
			- increase IL-7 (Glutathione)
				- Glutathione increases IL-7
			- increase interferons like interferon-gamma
				- substances that change interferon response
					- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130854/

					- Ginkgo: a potent central nervous system antioxidant for the treatment of circulation disorders, memory problems, high blood pressure, depression, tinnitus and immune system disorders
					- Licorice: an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic herb used to boost energy, treat respiratory tract infections as well as female disorders, ulcers, adrenal insufficiency and congestion
					- Melatonin: a hormone produced by the pineal gland with strong antioxidant and immune system boosting properties
					- Milk Thistle (Silymarin): a herb most commonly recommended as a liver cleanser and complementary medical treatment for hepatitis
					- Medicinal Mushrooms: Reishi, Maitake, Shiitake, Kombucha and others stimulate many aspects of the immune system including the production of interferon
					- Siberian Ginseng: stimulates T-cell and B-cell activity, energy, libido, body fat burning and many stress-related conditions
					- Vitamin C and bioflavonoids, especially proanthocyanidins (pycnogenols) like grape seed extract, pine bark extract and bilberry, quercetin, hesperidin and catechin are powerful antioxidants

		- inhibit HMGB1 (glycyrrhizin)
			- High mobility group B1 (HMGB1) has been recognized as a proinflammatory cytokine and more recently, as a proangiogenic factor
			- HMGB1 itself may signal through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and via toll-like receptors, TLR2 and TLR4
			- Activation of these receptors results in the activation of NFkappaB, which induces the upregulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors and inflammation
			- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18264787/
			- high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1), an alarmin protein released from dying tumor cells, acts as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling
			- inhibiting HMGB1 may reduce cancer progression

			- also inhibit IGF2BP2/IMP2/VICKZ2/p62, (a let-2 inhibitor) as well while increasing let-2, so that let-2 can increase
				- Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IGF2BP2 gene
					- This gene encodes a member of the IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (IMP) family
				- growth hormone increases IMP2, so increasing the growth hormone inhibitor somatostatin is useful to decrease IMP2
				- somatostatin increasers: turmeric/curcumin, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and vitamin D elevate somatostatin levels
				- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35023719/
		- increase 'resolvins' to prevent cancer reoccurrence (omega-3 fatty acids + (atorvastatin or aspirin))
			- omega-3 fatty acids + (atorvastatin or aspirin) produce resolvins, which reduce tumor reoccurrence caused by dead cancer cells from previous treatments
			- https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320227
			- The cancer cells that survive treatment, combined with an inflammatory setting induced by "cancer cell debris", may result in cancer progression
			- "Dead cancer cell debris-induced growth" is naturally a part of the tissue regeneration cycle
			- debris is interpreted by the tissue as injury signal and stimulates wound healing and regeneration
			- Overcoming the dilemma of "dead cancer cell debris-induced tumor growth" is required to prevent tumor recurrence of treatment-resistant tumors — the major reason for the failure of cancer therapy
			- resolvins stopped the debris-induced tumor growth and blocked the cancer cells from spreading
			- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12391014/
			- COX-2 converted DHA to 13-hydroxy-DHA that switched with aspirin to endogenous 17R-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid, then transformed COX-2-ASA-derived 17R-hydroxy-DHA into resolvins
			- compounds inhibited microglial cell cytokine expression and in vivo dermal inflammation and peritonitis, reducing 40-80% leukocytic exudates
			- exudates, vascular, leukocytes and neural cells treated with aspirin convert DHA to novel 17R-hydroxy series of docosanoids that are potent regulators

			- https://www.amazon.com/Gaia-Herbs-Ashwagandha-Liquid-Capsules/dp/B06XSTTX7C/
			- also avoiding excess heat seemed to help (keeping temperature below 76 F), because heat shock proteins can help cancer grow
			- 'garcinia cambogia, red yeast rice, calestrol, ashwagandha, berberine, moringa, selenium, holy basil, milk thistle, piperlongumine' is a more complete combination with high coverage of functionality
			- also when I got Covid-19, my brain tumor was reduced without any medicine during the active infection immune response, possibly bc of Covid proteins' binding activity or other interactions with ACE2, "reduction-oxidation (redox) pathways related to cytochrome c", EGFR/VEGFR, HGFR/c-MET, adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), "damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that alarms the immune system of any potential danger in all cell types to help them mount an appropriate immune defense via activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)", or upregulating these factors in the default covid immune response:
				- 'increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, interferon-inducible protein 10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)' or IgG/IgM antibodies
				- upregulation of cyt c, increased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, increase in amide I concentration in mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in ANT
					- this is bc the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine altered mitochondria by: 
						- 'downregulation of cyt c, resulting in lowered oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, leading to the lowering of the immune response. A decrease of amide I concentration in mitochondrial membrane potential suggested functional deterioration of the ANT'

		- as an example of why you need to look up everything youre consuming:
			- olive oil and turmeric can downregulate p53 so you may want to avoid those during your initial cancer treatment, despite their other anti-cancer effects, as there is currently no tool to compute 'net effects of a set of supplements/nutrients' (let alone a tool to identify all the known effects of a substance), bc a script to do that wouldnt benefit drug companies and doctors, it would make them obsolete, and they obey incentives at all times it seems
			- similarly, a script to identify what functions a patient needs (rather than just which condition they have, as there are many different states requiring different treatments with complex conditions) and which substances have those functions, and a script to identify functions of a compound, are also useful

- cancer variables

	- the point of these lists is to group substances with functions/effects/structures that either inhibit specific processes that favor cancer, or activate specific processes that suppress/reduce cancer in specific cells/genes/pathways
		- this includes processes such as:
			- angiogenesis, glycolysis, glutaminolysis, prenylation, phosphorylation, methylation, activation, oxidation, polyglutamylation, sumoylation and glutathionylation, protein ubiquitination (adding a ubiquitous regulatory protein called 'ubiquitin' to another protein), acetylation, inflammation, gene activation/mutations/amplifications/overexpressions/loss of heterozygosity
		- cancer variables
			- surface proteins/sugars
			- mutation sequences
			- sirtuins
			- cell senescence
			- lower purines
				- impaired purine metabolism is associated with the progression of cancer
				- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6077182/
			- lower oxalates
				- chronic exposure of cells to oxalate promotes the transformation of cells from normal to tumor cells, inducing the expression of a proto-oncogen as c-fos
				- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4618885/
			- increase MAO-A
				- MAO-A produces an amine oxidase, which is a class of enzyme known to affect carcinogenesis
				- Clorgyline, an MAO-A enzyme inhibitor, prevents apoptosis in melanoma cells
				- Cholangiocarcinoma suppresses MAO-A expression, and those patients with higher MAO-A expression had less adjacent organ invasion and better prognosis and survival
				- Monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors have been shown to decrease the progression of glioblastoma (GBM) and other cancers
				- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37172473/
			- avoiding unnecessary medications (treat conditions like acidosis that lead to gout and lower purines in diet, rather than using allopurinol)
				- allopurinol also blocks the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine, xanthine (released from dead cancer cells) leading to their accumulation in the body
			- lower cholesterol
				- high/low cholesterol is associated with increased risk of cancer
			- increase insulin sensitivity/treat diabetes
				- PI3Ks relate to the sensitivity of cancer tumors to insulin and IGF1, and in calorie restriction
			- nitric oxide/hydrogen sulfide
				- Hydrogen sulfide and nitric oxide are mutually dependent in the regulation of angiogenesis and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation
				- hydrogen sulfide, produced by cystathionine-β-synthase, stimulates bioenergetics, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis in colon cancer
			- hormones
				- hormone-dependent cancer is a type of cancer that is dependent on a hormone for growth and/or survival
					- Examples include breast cancer, which is dependent on estrogens like estradiol, and prostate cancer, which is dependent on androgens like testosterone
					- If a tumor is hormone-sensitive, it means that there are special proteins called receptors on cells surface
					- when the hormone bind the matched receptor, it results in growth and spread of cancer cells
					- Both endogenous and exogenous hormones, by driving cell proliferation, increased the number of cell divisions and the opportunity for random genetic errors to lead to cancer
					- compounds in soy like daidzein can reduce risk of hormone-dependent cancer
			- polyphenols/flavonoids
			- tumor markers as alternate treatment targets (vimentin, PCNA)
			- side effects of cancer drugs as alternate treatment targets
			- pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB))
				- Cytokines include chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines, and tumour necrosis factors, but generally not hormones or growth factors 
				- produced by a broad range of cells, including immune cells like macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and mast cells, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and various stromal cells; a given cytokine may be produced by more than one type of cell
				- act through cell surface receptors and are especially important in the immune system
				- cytokines modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses, and regulate the maturation, growth, and responsiveness of particular cell populations
				- Some cytokines enhance or inhibit the action of other cytokines in complex ways
				- They are different from hormones, which are also important cell signaling molecules
				- Hormones circulate in higher concentrations, and tend to be made by specific kinds of cells
				- pro/anti-inflammatory interleukins (interleukins are a type of cytokine)
			- antioxidants
				- block reactive oxygen species (ROS)
			- ghrelin
				- ghrelin's function in regulating several processes related to cancer progression, especially in metastasis and proliferation
				- Ghrelin regulates processes associated with cancer, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, cell invasion, inflammation, and angiogenesis
				- Ghrelin has predominantly antiinflammatory effects and may play a role in protecting against cancer-related inflammation
				- the In1-ghrelin variant, the enzyme GOAT, and the GHSR-1b receptor appear to play key roles in tumor proliferation and cancer aggressiveness
				- The role of native ghrelin in cancer is not fully understood, but studies suggest that effects are dependent on cell type and levels of this hormone; native ghrelin likely has proliferative effects at low doses through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
				- ghrelin and GHS-R mRNA are highly expressed in metastatic forms of cancers
				- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9032665/
		    - inhibitory immune processes
				- anergy
					- a lack of reaction by the body's defense mechanisms to foreign substances, and consists of a direct induction of peripheral lymphocyte tolerance
				- clonal deletion
				- immunoregulation
			- white blood cells (leukocytes)
				- lymphocytes
					- B/T cells
						- related to cell proliferation
						- B cells
							- memory B cells
							- function in the humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune system
							- B cells produce antibody molecules which may be either secreted or inserted into the plasma membrane where they serve as a part of B-cell receptors
							- When a naïve or memory B cell is activated by an antigen, it proliferates and differentiates into an antibody-secreting effector cell, known as a plasmablast or plasma cell
							- B cells present antigens (antigen-presenting cells, APCs)
							- b cells also secrete cytokines
							- B cells, unlike the other two classes of lymphocytes, T cells and natural killer cells, express B cell receptors (BCRs) on their cell membrane
								- BCRs allow the B cell to bind to a foreign antigen, against which it will initiate an antibody response
								- B cell receptors are extremely specific, with all BCRs on a B cell recognizing the same epitope
						- T cells
							- hostile tumor microenvironment suppresses T cell activity
							- chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
								- receptor proteins that have been engineered to give T cells the new ability to target a specific antigen
								- The receptors are chimeric in that they combine both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions into a single receptor
								- CAR T cell therapy modifies T cells to recognize cancer cells in order to more effectively target and destroy them
							- T cell exhaustion plays a role in tumor protection
							- Memory T cells
							- T cells with CD8 or CD4 Cell Surface Proteins
								- CD8+ "killer" (cytotoxic)
								- CD4+ "helper" T cells
								- Regulatory CD4+ T cells
							- Natural killer T cell
							- Innate-like T cells (NKT cells, MAIT cells, and gammadelta T cells)
							- Mucosal associated invariant T cells
							- Gamma delta T cells
					- innate lymphoid cells
						- NK cells
							- NK cells release cytotoxic molecules, which lyse tumor cells
			- actin
			- enzymes (like kinases) which have activity against proteins associated with processes that can be dysregulated in cancer			
			- growth factors
			- oncogenes and anti-cancer genes
				- p53 and other relevant proteins
			- specific proteins like serine/threonine, tyrosine, glutamine, ubiquitin, survivin
			- sequences/sets/networks of optimal functions to treat cancer
				- if there is an optimal 'sequence' like a possible sequence of coordinating sets like 'apoptosis-induction, angiogenesis inhibitor, metastasis inhibitors, and glucose/protein/input starvation, then DNA repair once the tumor is definitely gone' which is optimal in order to avoid known errors (such as for example 'substances that deactivate/kill existing negative structres first, then substances that inhibit new bonds/receptors' or 'avoiding taking DNA repair compounds first, which might help cancer cells repair the most, so they survive more', which Im citing as a possible example of a possible interaction, rather than referencing known interactions), or an optimal set like 'compounds targeting all major pathways of cancer, or many different proteins involved in cancer, including BRCA/ATM, until the cancer type is diagnosed', Im not aware of research for that intent
				- there likely is an optimal sequence/set/network of compounds/processes for treating most cancer types/states in general (unless very different cancer types/states are relevant)
				- a 'network' is useful for cases where a treatment is preferred but is a dead-end, as it cant be followed by more of it or additional/coordinating steps in the same direction (as its only usable up to a point such as bc resistance develops if its not effective after that point), after which other treatments should be tried (as in 'multiple overlapping sequences' and 'multiple directions such as reversing direction toward a dead-end')
				- this is in contrast to an option like 'trying/cycling all medicines randomly' which can have contrary effects and could help cancer instead of host cells
				- as another example, 'adding a PCNA inhibitor/downregulator' might be a good general rule to apply (except in contraindicated cases)
					- examples include olive oil, ashwagandha, short chain fatty acids, green tea, holy basil, thyme, d-limonene, atorvastatin/simvastatin
				- strategy for Aurora-A inhibitors in RB1, ARID1A and MYC gene mutation tumors, and potential synergistic strategy for mTOR, PAK1, MDM2, MEK inhibitors or PD-L1 antibodies combined with targeting Aurora-A kinase
					- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37521867/
					- Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A), a serine/threonine kinase, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including mitotic entry, centrosome maturation and spindle formation. 
					- Overexpression or gene-amplification/mutation of Aurora-A kinase occurs in different types of cancer, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. 
					- Alteration of Aurora-A impacts multiple cancer hallmarks, especially, immortalization, energy metabolism, immune escape and cell death resistance which are involved in cancer progression and resistance
					- Specifically, the mechanisms of Aurora-A kinase promote acquired resistance through modulating DNA damage repair, feedback activation bypass pathways, resistance to apoptosis, necroptosis and autophagy, metastasis, and stemness


- relevant structures to cancer

	- oncometabolites
		- these compounds can trigger cancer when their metabolism is dysregulated and when they are produced/available in that dysregulated state
		- Cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis, which is reached through defects in enzymes involved in normal cell metabolism, this allows the cancer cells to meet their energy needs and divert acetyl-CoA from the TCA cycle to build essential biomolecules such as amino acids and lipids
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncometabolism
			Oncometabolite			Role														Oncogenes							Enzyme affected								Associated malignancies
			D-2-hydroxyglutarate	Inhibits ATP synthase and mTOR signalling					IDH1 IDH2 							Isocitrate dehydrogenase					Brain cancer, Leukemia
			Succinate				Inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase					SDHA,SDHB,SDHC,SDHD,SDHAF1,SDHAF2	succinate dehydrogenase						Renal and Thyroid tumors
			Fumarate				Inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase					FH									Fumarate hydratase							Leiomyomata, Renal cysts

			Choline					Methyl donor for DNA methylation which disrupts DNA repair	PCYT1A								phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1 choline-α	Breast, Brain and Prostate cancer
			Lactate					Induces local immunosuppression								LDHA								Lactate dehydrogenase A						Various types of cancer
			Glutamine*				Primary carbon-source for the biosynthesis of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate
		- oncometabolites include: 
			- 2‐hydroxyglutarate, glucose, fumarate, succinate, sarcosine, glutamine, asparagine, choline, and lactate
			- these are suggested as biomarkers in glioma, prostate, gastrointestinal, breast, and endocrine cancers
		- for example, 2‐hydroxyglutarate (the D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) form of the TCA cycle intermediate, α‐ketoglutarate) is in limited quantity in normal tissues but is at a higher concentrations in cancer cells
			- This oncometabolite is the result of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1 or IDH2) gene mutation commonly occurring in gliomas and acute myelogenousleukemias (AMLs)
			- Increasing D2HG can change dioxygenase function requiring α‐ketoglutarate, change the epigenome of the cell (like prolylhydroxylation of 5‐methyl cytosine in DNA), and inhibit histone lysine demethylase
	
	- oncogenes
		- for example, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor is a possible treatment target, bc EGFR is an oncogene
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene
		- oncogenes, grouped by type
			- Growth factors, or mitogens
				- such as c-Sis													
				- induces cell proliferation
			- Receptor tyrosine kinases
				- such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), HER2/neu
				- transduce signals for cell growth and differentiation
			- Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases
				- such as Src-family, Syk-ZAP-70 family, and BTK family of tyrosine kinases, the Abl gene in CML - Philadelphia chromosome
				- mediate the responses to, and the activation receptors of cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival
			- Cytoplasmic Serine/threonine kinases & their regulatory subunits
				- such as Raf kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinases through overexpression
				- involved in organism development, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation, cells survival, and apoptosis															
			- Regulatory GTPases
				- such as Ras protein
				- involved in signalling a major pathway leading to cell proliferation
			- Transcription factors
				- such as myc gene
				- regulate transcription of genes that induce cell proliferation
			- Transcriptional coactivators
				- such as YAP, WWTR1 genes
				- interact with transcription factor partners to regulate transcription of genes that induce cell proliferation

	- specific treatment strategies

		- brain cancer-specific substances
			- resveratrol, icariin, quercetin, propolisis, salvia menthaefolia roots, ficus carica latex, berberine, withaferin A, curcumin, angelica sinensis root, ardipusilloside 1, eckol, MSC500, AMT (chamomile and additives including human insulin, vitamins, calcium and the antihistamine chlorpheniramine), thymoquinone, cucurbitacins, betulinic acid from betula pubescens, diosquinone from diospyros tricolor
			- zataria multiflora and tetandrine also significantly increased the radiosensitivity of the A172 and the U87 and U251 GBM cell lines, respectively 
			- toosendanin from melia toosendan increased the p53 expression
			- procyanidine inhibited P-gp and increased the therapeutic efficacy of adriamycin by allowing it to permeate the BBB 
			- galactoside-specific lectin from mistletoe (patupilone - epothilone B)
			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955138/
			- Coriolus versicolor (krestin polysaccharide), Maitake fraction D, long-chain polysaccharides (beta-glucans from maitake, reishi, and shiitake mushrooms)
    		- sodium R lipoate plus hydroxycitrate
    			- hydroxycitrate from garcinia cambogia may block metabolism of sugar/fat in cancer cells, by blocking an enzyme known as ATP citrate lyase. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is an enzyme linked to both sugar and fat metabolism, which is produced more in cancer cells, and therefore reduces the production of cellular energy, known as ATP
    		- boswellia
    		- cbd with thc 
				- Preliminary studies from the lab suggest that cannabinoid chemicals THC and CBD can stop glioblastoma (GBM) cells from growing, causing them to die and disrupting the blood supply to the tumour cells
    		- bitter ginger (zerumbone)

    			- NF1
    			- PTEN
    			- MDM2 
    			- alterations in RTK/Ras/PI3K signaling pathways (moringa, celastrol, holy basil, aloe emodin inhibit this pathway)
    		- amplifications of EGFR and PDGFR


	- general treatment strategies

		- ketogenic diet
			- Foods that are beneficial for glioblastoma patients include ketogenic foods such as coconut oil, cheese
    			- Plenty of vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus, cucumber should also be consumed
    			- Processed foods and drinks high in sugar such as sodas should be avoided

		- for patients with organ damage, a subset and sequence of strategies are useful
			- avoiding substances that damage organs (thunder god vine, magnolia/honokiol, fenistein, quercetin, emodin, caveolin, parsley, baicalin, limonene, resveratrol, coffee, apigenin, turmeric, holy basil, ginger, propolis, berberine, chicory, uncaria tomentosa, withaferin, saffron, green tea, etc, are all damaging to kidneys in normal doses, despite being useful against cancer)
			- using less damaging anti-cancer substances in small doses (modified citrus pectin, luteolin, astragalus, chamomile, short-chain fatty acids from resistant starch/inulin/pectin/fructooligosaccharides, lactoferrin, sulforaphane, fisetin, etc) during initial reduction phase
			- glucose and methionine/cysteine/glutamine/amino acid/collagen starvation (eating mostly just a low-nutrient oil like refined almond oil and resistant starch for calories (or a water fast) with other less harmful anti-cancer substances to reduce tumors in initial reduction phase)
			- once kidney function is back to normal, smaller doses of the harmful substances can be tried, after the initial reduction phase for prevention of reoccurrence

		- cancers of the breast/ovary/uterus, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids
			- Chamomile is contraindicated

		- hormone-sensitive cancers
			- ginseng, soy are contraindicated

		- autoimmune disease
			- astragalus is contraindicated

		- use a few substances with a high range of functionality rather than targeting one pathway (if the mechanism of the specific cancer or cancer type is not known)
			- Resveratrol, ginger, saffron, fisetin, quercetin, propolis, chicory, uncaria tomentosa, curcumin, withaferin from ashwagandha or similar compounds like ginsenoside from ginseng, EGCG from green tea, selenium, vitamin C
			- celastrol is also highly/broadly active against some cancerous processes, but has some nontrivial negative side effects
			- these can cause liver/kidney damage in excess amounts, so its important to stay under the max dose for you
			- intake of vitamin C and β-carotene and α-tocopherol can reduce the risk of brain tumors, but can also help cancer cells grow in some cases
				- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9372437/
			- higher intake of magnesium/vitamin b12/b6/phosphorus/iron are associated with higher rates of specific cancers, folate/Vitamin A/C/E are associated with lower rates of specific cancers, but can also help cancer cells grow in some cases
				- https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03018-y#Fig2
			- avoiding methionine/cysteine/glutathione/folate/niacin during tumor reduction is similarly important, as they have multiple mechanisms of helping cancer grow

		- treat other systemic conditions with treatment such as those mentioned in other_condition_treatments.md so the system has extra resources to fight cancer

		- diet high in polyphenols which can be active against cancer
			- Flavonoids include flavones, flavonols, flavanols, flavanones, isoflavones, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins
				- Particularly abundant flavanoids in foods are catechin (tea, fruits), hesperetin (citrus fruits), cyanidin (red fruits and berries), daidzein (soybean), proanthocyanidins (apple, grape, cocoa), and quercetin (onion, tea, apples)
				- intake of soy and soy isoflavones is associated with a lower risk of mortality from gastric, colorectal, breast and lung cancers
				- increase in isoflavone consumption by 10 mg per day was associated with a 7% decrease in risk from all cancers
			- Phenolic acid include caffeic acid
			- Lignans are polyphenols derived from phenylalanine found in flax seed and other cereals

		- reduce inflammation
			- anti-inflammatory substances

				- antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C powder, vitamin E, copper, zinc, selenium, glutathione, alpha lipoic acid (spinach, broccoli, tomatoes)
				- an antioxidant that helps protect your cells against the effects of free radicals
				- free radicals are molecules produced when your body breaks down food or is exposed to tobacco smoke and radiation from the sun, X-rays or other sources
				- Free radicals might play a role in heart disease, cancer and other diseases
				- Your body's cells naturally produce some powerful antioxidants, such as alpha lipoic acid and glutathione. 
					- The foods you eat supply other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E. 
					- Plants are full of compounds known as phytochemicals—literally, "plant chemicals"—many of which seem to have antioxidant properties as well. 
					- For example, after vitamin C has "quenched" a free radical by donating electrons to it, a phytochemical called hesperetin (found in oranges and other citrus fruits) restores the vitamin C to its active antioxidant form. 
					- Carotenoids (such as lycopene in tomatoes and lutein in kale) and flavonoids (such as flavanols in cocoa, anthocyanins in blueberries, quercetin in apples and onions, and catechins in green tea) are also antioxidants

		- avoid vitamin deficiencies/overdoses, and avoid vitamin antagonists which can cause deficiencies

				- Levothyroxine (pyridoxal-5-phosphate)
				- The inactive form pyridoxine competitively inhibits the active pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (symptoms of vitamin B6 supplementation in the pyridoxine form can mimic those of vitamin B6 deficiency, an effect which can be avoided by supplementing with P5P instead)
				- AlaP (alanine phosphonate) inhibits alanine racemases, but its lack of specificity has prompted further designs of ALR inhibitors
				- Gabaculine and Vigabatrin inhibit GABA aminotransferase
				- Canaline and 5-fluoromethylornithine inhibit ornithine aminotransferase
				- Amino-oxy SAM inhibits ACC synthase
				- egg whites (avidin)
				- antifolate dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (antimicrobial trimethoprim, the antiprotozoal pyrimethamine and the chemotherapy drug methotrexate, and the sulfonamides (competitive inhibitors of 4-aminobenzoic acid in the reactions of dihydropteroate synthetase))

					- increases the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant agent
					- citicoline affects the staurosporine-induced apoptosis cell-signalling pathway by interacting with the glutathione system and by inhibiting caspase-3
					- Once acetylcholine moves across the synapse, it can bind to two types of receptors: nicotinic receptors and muscarinic receptors
					- ability to produce Acetylcholine is dependent upon IL-21 signalling to the T cells
					- during infection this immune-derived acetylcholine is necessary for the T cells to migrate into infected tissues
					- acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a serine hydrolase whose primary function is to degrade acetylcholine and terminate neurotransmission, and is involved in cellular growth, apoptosis, drug resistance pathways, response to stress signals and inflammation
					- however, citicoline is an antifungal that can help reduce fungal load where fungal infections have caused or otherwise help cancer cells grow
					- Supplements that stop the breakdown of acetylcholine include Bacopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba and huperzine A
					- Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter that plays a role in brain functions, such as memory, and body functions, such as muscle contractions to move your muscles. Low levels of acetylcholine are associated with memory issues and muscle disorders

						- I3C induces the mRNA Overexpression of UBE2L3 gene and Cell Proliferation Arrest
						- I3C is a natural AhR ligand (AHR reduces tumor growth and impacts UBE2L3 gene, which impacts HPV proteins E6/7)
						- HPV virus oncoprotein E6 binds to p53, resulting in its degradation and allowing uncontrolled cell proliferation
						- HPV E7 protein maintains host cell differentiation by targeting retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
						- The host cell can ubiquitinate E6 and E7 through UBE2L3 gene, whose expression depends on the interaction between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) with Xenobiotic Responsive Elements (XREs) located in the UBE2L3 gene promoter
						- We found that I3C promotes the activation of AhR and decreases cell proliferation, possibly through UBE2L3 mRNA induction, which would result in the ubiquitination of HPV E7
			- EBV
				- green tea suppresses EBV
					- EGCG, a polyphenol in green tea, has shown in a study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA, gene transcription, and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV lytic genes Zta, Rta, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by Rta), however, the highly stable EBNA-1 gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein–Barr_virus
				- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868022/
				- EBV causes Multiple Sclerosis, and can also cause cancer by mutating certain genes
					- EBV-associated cancers are mainly lymphomas derived from B cells and T cells and carcinomas derived from epithelial cells
					- EBV can induce oncogenesis in its host cell by activating various signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), Janus kinase/signal transducer and transcription activator (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and Wnt/β-catenin, which are regulated by EBV-encoded proteins and noncoding RNA
					- It has been found that EBNA1 may induce chromosomal breakage in the 11th chromosome, specifically in the 11q23 region between the FAM55D gene and FAM55B, which EBNA-1 appears to have a high affinity for due to its DNA-binding domain having an interest in a specific palindromic repeat in this section of the genome. While the cause and exact mechanism for this is unknown, the byproduct results in errors and breakage of the chromosomal structure as cells stemming from the line of the tainted genome undergo mitosis. Since genes in this area have been implicated in leukemia and is home to a tumor suppressor gene (such as tumor suppressors p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX activated by ATM serine/threonine kinase) that is modified or not present in most tumor gene expression, it's been hypothesized that breakage in this area is the main culprit behind the cancers that EBV increases the chance of.
					- ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)
						- ATM is thought to be a master controller of cell cycle checkpoint signalling pathways that are required for cellular responses to DNA damage such as double-strand breaks
						- a defect in ATM has severe consequences in repairing certain types of damage to DNA, and cancer may result from improper repair

    - inhibit glycolysis/glutaminolysis/angiogenesis/DNA repair
    	- inhibiting/activating sirtuins
			- Sirtuins (SIRTs), class III histone deacetylases, are differentially expressed in several cancers, where they display both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive properties, depending on cellular context
			- SIRT1 represses p53-mediated tumour suppression
			- SIRT3 regulates levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Loss of SIRT3 results in increased levels of ROS, with subsequent activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and increased expression of HIF1 target genes, including glycolysis and angiogenesis genes, which favour tumour growth
			- SIRT4 regulates glutamine metabolism by inhibiting glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis. Loss of SIRT4 leads to increased glutamine catabolism, a pathway that promotes tumour growth
			- SIRT6 regulates cancer metabolism and inflammation by acting as a co-repressor for HIF1α, MYC and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Loss of SIRT6 results in increased expression of glycolysis, glutaminolysis and ribosomal genes, all of which favour proliferation and tumorigenesis
			- sirtuins SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 proteins are involved in DNA repair

				- Histone deacetylase inhibitors as anti-neoplastic agents


    - reduce required resources for cancers
        - reduce carbon sources
        	- reduce cysteine/glutathione/methionine (methionine helps create cysteine/glutathione)
        		- Cancer cells undergo a metabolic rewiring in order to fulfill the energy and biomass requirements. 
        		- Cysteine contributes for cancer metabolic remodeling at three different levels: (1) in redox control, free or as a component of glutathione; (2) in ATP production, via hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production, serving as a donor to electron transport chain (ETC), and (3) as a carbon source for biomass and energy production, in which cysteine benefits the metabolic fitness/survival of cancer cells
        		- https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.00947/full#:~:text=Cysteine%20plays%20a%20pivotal%20role%20in%20cancer%3A%20it,a%20donor%20of%20electrons%20%28e%20%E2%88%92%29%20to%20ETC.

        		- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33498875/
    	- reduce methionine/folate
    		- Methionine dependency is a common feature of most cancer cells, which have an inability to grow without methionine even in the presence of its precursor homocysteine
	    	- the methionine dependency of tumor growth may contribute to the aggressivity of cancers
	    		- Cytosolic folate cycle is required for methionine synthesis
	    		- Its dysregulation may influence cell reprogramming towards pluripotency 
	    		- exogenous methionine is required for tumor formation but not for monolayer cell proliferation
	    		- low activity cytosolic folate cycle is observed in some cancers
		    		- repressed cytosolic folate cycle underlies the methionine dependency of cancer

				- chlorella
				- cilantro 
				- avoid foods that can have higher levels of lead/cadmium than other foods (unless the manufacturer explicitly removes them)
					- basil, oregano, thyme, rice, fruit juice, coffee, chocolate
				- these foods were more often found to have safer levels of lead/cadmium
					- black pepper, coriander/cilantro, curry powder, garlic powder, saffron, sesame seeds
			- agglutinins
				- various agglutinins have immune system effects (peanut agglutinins have a positive assocation with cancer, wheat germs have an unclear association, whereas abrus agglutinins may be helpful in reducing cancer)
			- coumarins
				- Citrus fruits are high in secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, limonoids, and coumarins, which are associated with a reduced risk of cancer
				- however citrus 'juices' were also associated with higher risk of non-melanoma skin cancer https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33946526/
			- avoid animal protein during cancer treatment (which is high in methionine/cysteine compared to most vegetable protein)
				- a low protein diet with vegetable protein delayed tumor growth
		- plastics (PFAS, BPA)
			- that means washing clothes twice before wearing, using non-toxic laundry detergent and soap and anything else that touches your skin, not buying plastic anything such as shower curtains, not trying on new clothes without washing them first, looking for ways to clean PFAS from your water, avoiding food that binds to PFAS such as kale, avoiding soda cans made with BPA (avoiding canned food at all, similarly avoiding ceramic containers that may contain lead, instead using wood/pyrex where possible), etc
			- these can cause organ failure which can make it more difficult to fight cancer and can also cause cancer directly
			- plastics in products often accompany other harmful substances like formaldehyde which is a carcinogen
		- artificial sweeteners
			- monk fruit and stevia and possibly xylitol might be the only safe artificial sweeteners other than natural sugars like honey
		- emulsifiers

		    			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170704/
		    			- polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), a common air pollutant and a mammary carcinogen, have been shown to cause DNA damage and to contribute to the high incidence and poor prognosis of cancer patient
		    			- air pollutants may contain an environmental oxidative stressor, which could trigger redox-sensitive pathways to induce cell death and other biological processes, such as inflammation
		    			- increases in the concentration of reactive oxygen species
		    			- PM demonstrate both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects in vitro, which is in line with the biological characteristics of xenoestrogens
		    			- PM2.5 can induce oxidative stress, inflammation, genotoxicity, and accelerate liver inflammation and steatosis
		    			- increased levels of lipid peroxidation in various organs including heart, liver, lungs, and testicles indicating that airborne PM2.5 acts as a systemic toxin
		    			- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112066/
		    				- carbon black (CB) nanoparticle instillation caused pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity in liver and lungs
		    				- diesel exhaust particles DEP induced tissue damage through oxidative stress including the generation of reactive oxygen species by a non-enzymatic process or by cytochrome P-450 catabolic enzymatic reactions
		    			- AHCC can bind to TLR4 to activate it, turmeric/sulforaphane can downregulate TLR4
			    			- PM exposure induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion from isolated Kupffer cells in a concentration-dependent manner and this effect was reduced if Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was absent, indicating that PM acts like a TLR4 ligand
			    			- CB nanoparticle exposure activated caspase 1, increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production, and induced pyroptosis, an inflammasome-dependent form of cell death through TLR4 stimulation
			- silica/VOCs like formaldehyde
				- avoid fragrances, and other substances where its difficult to determine the ingredients, and especially paint, which has carcinogens like silica and VOCs like formaldehyde in it
			- tobacco smoke
				- most important tumorigenic compounds in tobacco smoke were, in order of importance, acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide, and isoprene
				- smoke also triggers free radicals, antagonizes vitamin C, and exposes people to lead
				- Most of these compounds cause DNA damage by forming DNA adducts or by inducing other alterations in DNA
			- acetaldehyde
				- in a lot of foods naturally, but also in a lot of pollutants
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde
			- avoid alkylating agents 
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylating_antineoplastic_agent (when not using temozolomide for treatment)
		- other compounds can trigger cancer when used in large amounts or when other errors have occurred
			- nicotinamide
			- folate
			- bpc-157
		- estrogen can be carcinogenic, so taking anti-estrogens can be effective in some cancers that are not estrogen-sensitive
			- about 75% of breast cancers are estrogen-sensitive: they express the hormone receptor estrogen receptor α (ERα)
			- estrogen promotes tumor growth in ERα-negative cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
			- estrogen directly affects cancer cells to promote cell survival and proliferation,
			- estrogen suppresses the immune response and protects tumors

	
	- improve organ function
		- improve liver function
			- increase microRNA MiR-22
				- miR-22 acts like a brake, stopping the production of certain proteins, including cyclin A, protein deacetylases and hypoxia-inducible factor, that can fuel liver cancer growth
				- metabolites produced by the gut microbiome (retinoic acid, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and vitamin D3) help create miR-22 and have anti-cancer benefits
				- MiR-22 and lenvatinib reduced serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and cholesterol levels, indicating improved liver function

    	- WEE1 inhibitors
    		- inhibit WEE1 to synergize with AURKA inhibition and induce cell death
	    - PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors (immune checkpoint proteins)
	    	- the interaction of PD-L1 on the tumor cells with PD-1 on a T-cell reduces T-cell function signals to prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor cells. Use of an inhibitor that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 receptor can prevent the cancer from evading the immune system in this way


    - inhibit inhibitors of Fas protein (to activate Fas, which destroys cancer cells)
    	- inhibit KRAS which inhibits Fas protein
    		- KRAS G12D/G12C-mutations cause pancreatic/lung cancer
    			- KRAS is one of the most frequently activated oncogenes in human cancers
    			- mutant KRAS activates the expression of CD47, an antiphagocytic signal in cancer cells, leading to decreased phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages
    			- Mechanistically, mutant KRAS activates PI3K-STAT3 signaling, which restrains miR-34a expression and relieves the post-transcriptional repression of miR-34a on CD47
	    		- Genetic suppression of KRAS activated the Fas pathway, which is required for cancer cell death, and resulted in a greater number of T cells and fewer myeloid cells in the tumors
    			- KRAS G12D inhibition induced expression of the Fas pathway, reversed early tumor growth, increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, decreased myeloid infiltration and reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment in both early- and late-stage tumors
    			- However, while initially successful, the tumors eventually grew back
				- elimination of established tumors was dependent upon the activation of CD8+ T cells
				- If CD8+ T cells were suppressed, the tumors progressed despite treatment with MRTX1133
				- Following this, the researchers found that combining various immune checkpoint inhibitors with MRTX1133 led to sustained tumor regression, enhanced cancer cell clearance and improved survival outcomes
				- KRAS inhibition works, but monotherapy delivers only a transient response, especially when dealing with late-stage tumors
			- treatments
				- combination therapy using KRAS inhibitors and anti-CD47 antibodies (combining the KRAS(G12C) inhibitors AMG510/MRTX849 and PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors) are ongoing
				- combining an investigational Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor with a KRAS inhibitor or a WEE1 inhibitor showed efficacy against lung cancer cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance to KRAS inhibition

	- eliminate senescent cells
		- senomorphics (Apigenin, Rapamycin/Everolimus) modulate properties of senescent cells without eliminating them, suppressing phenotypes of senescence, including the SASP
		- through SASP, senescent cells contribute to cancer development and metastasis, so senolytics could act as anti-cancer compounds but fisetin specifically inhibits p53 so some can help cancer
		- senolytics:
			- FOXO4-related peptides, BCL-2 inhibitors, Src inhibitors, USP7 inhibitors, Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q), Fisetin, Navitoclax, Piperlongumine, Azithromycin/roxithromycin, SSK1, BIRC5 knockout, GLS1 inhibitors, Anti-GPNMB vaccine, Cardiac glycosides, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), Procyanidin C1, EF-24, HSP90 inhibitors

				- anticancer activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) has demonstrated anticancer effects, possibly by suppression of phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2)
				- in another experiment done on hamsters, bovine lactoferrin decreased the incidence of oral cancer by 50%
				- has multiple mechanisms including: cell membrane disruption, apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, and cell immunoreaction
				- also has high bioavailability after oral administration, high selectivity toward cancer cells, and a wide range of molecular targets controlling tumor proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and metastasization
				- it is able to promote or inhibit cell proliferation and migration depending on whether it acts upon normal or cancerous cells, respectively
				- it can prevent development or inhibit cancer growth by boosting adaptive immune response

		- inhibit BRAT1 cancer protein
			- Curcusones are compounds that come from a shrub named Jatropha curcas
				- curcusone D is extremely effective at shutting down cancer cells
				- BRAT1 protein regulates DNA damage response and DNA repair in cancer cells
				- BRAT1 encodes BRCA1-associated ATM activator 1 protein, thought to play a role in the DNA damage pathway regulated by BRCA1 and ATM
				- curcusone D damages cancer cells' DNA and keeps them from repairing it, thereby stopping cancer cells from growing and stopping their migration and therefore also metastasis
				- http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c00557
		- inhibit carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) cancer protein 
			- saccharin and acesulfame potassium
				- ACE K is more selective than saccharin
				- ACE K completely fills the CA IX binding site and binds directly to a catalytic zinc ion
				- these are still not quite selective enough to target only cancer proteins, so analogues of ACE K may be better
				- CA IX is a zinc protein that is overexpressed in cancer tissues and contributes to the growth and spread of malignant cells in lung, brain and breast cancers

		- turmeric


	- inhibit aneuploidy
		- when cell division goes wrong, it can lead to the creation of new cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy, which is found in some tumors


	- increase enzymes that regulate cell division
		- increase TTLL11
			- tubulin tyrosine ligase like 11 (TTLL11) is an enzyme that specifically modifies the spindle microtubules by adding glutamate chains to the surface of the microtubule (polyglutamylation), which defines the dynamism and stability of the spindle microtubules, which in turn protects against chromosome segregation errors (chromosomal instability)
			- without TTLL11, cells were much more likely to undergo chromosome segregation errors
			- Microtubules need to establish stable connections with the chromosomes to align them and pull them apart, but these connections also need to be flexible enough to be corrected on time to avoid any errors during segregation. 
			- Microtubules in cancer cells have low levels of TTLL11, making them too stable, thereby favoring the segregation of chromosomes in the presence of attachment errors that will result in aneuploid cells
			- https://phys.org/news/2022-11-cell-division-enzyme-earmarked-potential.html


	- prevent mutations that can cause cancer in higher amounts
		- hematopoietic stem cells that reside in the bone marrow and give rise to all of the body's different blood cells gradually acquire mutations in their DNA
		- Most of these mutations have no effect, but some can enhance a particular stem cell's ability to survive and proliferate, resulting in large numbers of blood cells that carry the same mutation
		- prevent aging-related mutations with substances like senolytics
		- prevent specific mutations like Dnmt3a mutations which can cause clonal hematopoiesis (repeated mutation in blood cells leading to cancer)
		- https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-scientists-mutations-blood-stem-cells.html


    - inhibit STING pathway, associated with a negative immune response
    	- STING1 gene makes a protein called STING that activates an inflammatory response when it detects foreign DNA molecules in the cytoplasm
   		- STING pathway triggers a strong inflammatory response that protects the body from foreign and unhealthy cells. But prolonged activation of the same pathway leads to a desensitization and ultimately to a "rewiring" of cellular signaling, which aids and abets cancer's spread, the researchers found.
		- long-term activation of the STING pathway leads to changes in cellular signaling that attracts cells that suppress the immune response to the area in and around the tumor
		- chromosomal instability (frequency at which chromosome segregation errors occur) is an important driver of cancer's ability to spread
		- cooperation between cancer cells with chromosomal instability and immune cells is driven by STING
		- treating a fibroblast with a STING agonist creates a strong initial immune response, after which the cells become desensitized to this pro-inflammatory pathway very quickly, and started to signal stress response pathways that dampened the immune response, thus having the opposite effect
		- low chromosomal instability or where STING had been depleted from cancer cells, they trigger a different response - a strong immune response that attacked the cancer cells
		- activating STING in these patients isn't very effective because most patients' cells are already desensitized to it, due to the persistent activation of the pathway from chromosomal instability, so these patients may actually benefit from STING inhibition
		- the subset of patients whose tumors can still mount a strong response to STING activation could be better candidates for STING agonists
		- Treatment of study mice with STING inhibitors reduced chromosomal instability-driven metastasis in melanoma, breast, and colorectal cancer models


	- inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines
		- pro-inflammatory cytokines include tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)

				- Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are fermented from dietary fibres by the gut microbiota
				- The three most common SCFAs are acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and butyrate (C4)
				- SCFA function epigenetically by inhibiting selected histone acetyltransferases that alter the expression of multiple genes and the activity of many signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt, Hedgehog, Hippo, and Notch) that contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer
				- SCFAs block cancer stem cell proliferation, thereby potentially delaying or inhibiting cancer development or relapse by targeting genes and pathways that are mutated in tumors (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor, and MET) and by promoting the expression of tumor suppressors (e.g., by up-regulating PTEN and p53)

				- EMC suppressed cancer cell proliferation by inducing downregulation of cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21
				- EMC decreased the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) but did not significantly change mitochondrial DNA copy number and membrane potential
				- Phosphorylation at Ser62 of c-Myc, a transcription factor of TFAM, was decreased by EMC treatment, which might be due to the suppression of H-ras expression

	- increase/decrease methylation depending on the gene
		- reduce DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes
		- increase methylation of oncogenes (DNA methyltransferases, DNMT)
			- Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms
			- Typically, there is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes.
			- temozolomide (a common cancer treatment) methylates DNA


	- increase/decrease phosphorylation
		- inhibit phosphorylation
			- kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate proteins, so theyre involved in cancer
			- tyrosine kinase inhibitors
				- Tyrosine kinases are enzymes responsible for the activation of many proteins by signal transduction cascades. 
				- The proteins are activated by adding a phosphate group to the protein (phosphorylation), a step that TKIs inhibit
		- increase phosphorylation
			- increases the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and MAPK 
				- Withaferin A 


	- inhibit oncogenes/oncoproteins
		- MCM8 or MCM9 
			- MCM8/MCM9 mutations can cause cancer
		- MET (oncogene)
			- Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF receptor) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MET gene
			- The protein possesses tyrosine kinase activity
			- MET is crucial for gastrulation, angiogenesis, myoblast migration, bone remodeling, and nerve sprouting among others
			- MET activates key oncogenic pathways (RAS, PI3K, STAT3, beta-catenin)
			- MET increases scatter (cells dissociation due to metalloprotease production), which often leads to metastasis
			- there is a correlation between inactivation of VHL tumor suppressor gene and increased MET signaling in renal cell carcinoma
			- treatments
				- MET kinase inhibitors
					- prevent ATP binding to MET, thus inhibiting receptor transphosphorylation and recruitment of the downstream effectors
					- may also inhibit HGF-induced motility and invasion of epithelial and carcinoma cells
					- may also repress both HGF-dependent and constitutive MET phosphorylation
					- may also inhibit c-KIT, MET, PDGFR, Flt3, and AXL
					- may also target multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with growth-promoting and angiogenic properties (MET, VEGFR2, and KDR)
					- K252a, SU11274 (SUGEN), PHA-665752, ARQ197 (ArQule), Foretinib (XL880, Exelixis), SGX523 (SGX Pharmaceuticals), MP470 (SuperGen)
				- HGF inhibitors (only blocks MET, if MET depends on HGF)
					- Since HGF is the only known ligand of MET, blocking the formation of a HGF:MET complex blocks MET biological activity
					- truncated HGF, anti-HGF neutralizing antibodies, and an uncleavable form of HGF have been utilized so far
					- NK4 (anti-angiogenic)
						- NK4 competes with HGF as it binds MET without inducing receptor activation, thus behaving as a full antagonist
						- NK4 is a molecule bearing the N-terminal hairpin and the four kringle domains of HGF
					- Neutralizing anti-HGF antibodies (AV299 (AVEO), and the fully human AMG102 (Amgen))
						- at least three antibodies, acting on different HGF epitopes, are necessary to prevent MET tyrosine kinase activation
					- Uncleavable HGF inhibits tumor growth and prevents metastasis
						- an engineered form of pro-HGF carrying a single amino-acid substitution, which prevents the maturation of the molecule
						- Uncleavable HGF is capable of blocking MET-induced biological responses by binding MET with high affinity and displacing mature HGF
						- Moreover, uncleavable HGF competes with the wild-type endogenous pro-HGF for the catalytic domain of proteases that cleave HGF precursors
						- Local and systemic expression of uncleavable HGF inhibits tumor growth and prevents metastasis
				- Decoy MET
					- a soluble truncated MET receptor (CGEN241 (Compugen)) that inhibits tumor growth and prevents metastasis
						- inhibit MET activation mediated by both HGF-dependent and independent mechanisms, as decoys prevent both the ligand binding and the MET receptor homodimerization
				- Immunotherapy targeting MET
					- enhance the immunologic response to MET-expressing tumor cells, or stimulate immune cells and altering differentiation/growth of tumor cells
					- Passive immunotherapy
						- Administering monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a form of passive immunotherapy
						- MAbs facilitate destruction of tumor cells by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
							- In CDC, mAbs bind to specific antigen, leading to activation of the complement cascade, which in turn leads to formation of pores in tumor cells
							- In ADCC, the Fab domain of a mAb binds to a tumor antigen, and Fc domain binds to Fc receptors present on effector cells (phagocytes and NK cells), thus forming a bridge between an effector and a target cells
								- This induces the effector cell activation, leading to phagocytosis of the tumor cell by neutrophils and macrophages
						- DN30 is monoclonal anti-MET antibody that recognizes the extracellular portion of MET
							- DN30 induces both shedding of the MET ectodomain as well as cleavage of the intracellular domain, which is successively degraded by proteasome machinery
								- As a consequence, on one side MET is inactivated, and on the other side the shed portion of extracellular MET hampers activation of other MET receptors, acting as a decoy
								- DN30 inhibits tumour growth and prevents metastasis
						- OA-5D5 is one-armed monoclonal anti-MET antibody that was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth 
							- OA-5D5 is produced as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli
							- It is composed of murine variable domains for the heavy and light chains with human IgG1 constant domains
							- The antibody blocks HGF binding to MET in a competitive fashion
					- Active immunotherapy
						- Active immunotherapy to MET-expressing tumors can be achieved by administering cytokines, such as interferons (IFNs) and interleukins (IL-2), which triggers non-specific stimulation of numerous immune cells
							- IFNs have been tested as therapies for many types of cancers and have demonstrated therapeutic benefits
							- IL-2 has been approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma, which often have deregulated MET activity
		- E6/E7
			- suppressed by withaferin A and indole-3-carbinol
		- UBE2L3 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2L3)
			- the gene for this enzyme is related to cancer in that UBE2L3 can ubiquitinate oncoproteins E6 and E7
		- EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein and RING1B gene
			- EWSR1-FLI1 cannot activate its target genes and transform a cell from healthy to cancerous state without RING1B, as shown by impaired tumor growth when RING1B is reduced
			- EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein is directed to the different parts of the genome by RING1B, allowing EWSR1-FLI1 to hijack the transcriptional program of the cells, turning them into cancerous cells.

				- one among numerous growth factors that regulate cell growth and division, and is involved in blood vessel formation
				- Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) are expressed in a variety of tumors
				- Activation of the PDGF/PDGFR signaling pathway is associated with cancer proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis through modulating multiple downstream pathways, including:
					- phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B pathway
					- mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway
		- Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases
			- Src-family, Syk-ZAP-70 family, and BTK family of tyrosine kinases, the Abl gene in CML

	- inhibit/trigger pathway components

		- inhibit/reduce ROS (reactive oxygen species)
			- Radiotherapy relies on ROS toxicity to eradicate tumor cells
				- Radiotherapy uses X-rays, γ-rays as well as heavy particle radiation such as protons and neutrons to induce ROS-mediated cell death and mitotic failure
			- After growth factor stimulation of RTKs, ROS can trigger activation of signaling pathways involved in cell migration and invasion 
				- such as members of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family – extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH-2 terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK
			- ROS can also promote migration by augmenting phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) p130Cas and paxilin
			- ROS have been shown to induce transcription factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis (MMP, VEGF) and metastasis (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and downregulation of PTEN)
			- ROS induces chronic inflammation by the induction of COX-2, inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6), chemokines (IL-8, CXCR4) and pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB)
				- These chemokines and chemokine receptors, in turn, promote invasion and metastasis of various tumor types
			- ROS-elevation as a anti-cancer treatment
				- ROS-elevating drugs further increase cellular ROS stress level, either:
					- by direct ROS-generation (e.g. motexafin gadolinium, elesclomol)
					- by agents that abrogate the inherent antioxidant system such as SOD inhibitor (e.g. ATN-224, 2-methoxyestradiol) and GSH inhibitor (e.g. PEITC, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO))
					- The result is an overall increase in endogenous ROS, which when above a cellular tolerability threshold, may induce cell death
					- On the other hand, normal cells appear to have, under lower basal stress and reserve, a higher capacity to cope with additional ROS-generating insults than cancer cells do
					- Therefore, the elevation of ROS in all cells can be used to achieve the selective killing of cancer cells.
				- Due to the dual role of ROS, both prooxidant and antioxidant-based anticancer agents have been developed. 
					- However, modulation of ROS signaling alone seems not to be an ideal approach due to adaptation of cancer cells to ROS stress, redundant pathways for supporting cancer growth and toxicity from ROS-generating anticancer drugs
					- Combinations of ROS-generating drugs with pharmaceuticals that can break the redox adaptation could be a better strategy for enhancing cancer cell cytotoxicity
				- physical exercise to induce ROS spikes to form tumor suppressor proteins
					- lack of intracellular ROS due to a lack of physical exercise may contribute to the malignant progression of cancer, because spikes of ROS are needed to correctly fold proteins in the endoplasmatic reticulum and low ROS levels may thus aspecifically hamper the formation of tumor suppressor proteins
					- Since physical exercise induces temporary spikes of ROS, this may explain why physical exercise is beneficial for cancer patient prognosis
				- Moreover, high inducers of ROS such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose and carbohydrate-based inducers of cellular stress induce cancer cell death more potently
					- this is because they exploit the cancer cell's high avidity for sugars
		- enzyme 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) 
			- pro-cancer and anti-cancer activity
				- AMPK may have a role in tumor suppression
					- AMPK may exert the tumor suppressing properties of liver kinase B1
					- AMPK activator metformin was correlated with a reduced risk of cancer
					- without AMPK expression, greater risk of developing lymphomas was seen
				- AMPK has a role as a tumor promoter by protecting cancer cells from stress
					- AMPK may swap from protecting against cancer to protecting the cancer itself
					- tumor cells with AMPK knockout are more susceptible to death by:
						- glucose starvation
						- extracellular matrix detachment
			- involved in cellular energy homeostasis
				- to activate glucose and fatty acid uptake and oxidation when cellular energy is low
				- in response to binding AMP and ADP, the net effect of AMPK activation is
					- stimulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, stimulation of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipogenesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis, and modulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells
		- increase c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) which are part of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) family, to increase p53, to induce apoptosis/DNA repair
			- increase JNK activators
				- Activation is carried out by two MAP kinase kinases, MKK4 and MKK7
				- neurotrophin binding to p75NTR activates a JNK signaling pathway that induces apoptosis of developing neurons
				- Inflammatory signals, changes in levels of reactive oxygen species, ultraviolet radiation, protein synthesis inhibitors, and a variety of stress stimuli can activate JNK
			- decrease JNK deactivators
				- JNK can be inactivated by Ser/Thr and Tyr protein phosphatases
				- TrkA can prevent p75NTR-mediated JNK pathway apoptosis
			- c-Jun, ATF2, ELK1, SMAD4, p53 and HSF1 are activated by JNK
				- JNK, through a series of intermediates, activates p53 and p53 activates Bax which initiates apoptosis
				- JNK can directly phosphorylate Bim-EL, a splicing isoform of Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim), which activates Bim-EL apoptotic activity
			- NFAT4, NFATC1 and STAT3 are inhibited by JNK
			- JNK is involved in:
				- bind and phosphorylate c-Jun on Ser-63 and Ser-73, within its transcriptional activation domain, regulating Jun protein turnover
				- are responsive to stress stimuli (such as cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock)
				- JNK phosphorylates SIRT6 on serine 10 in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) or other DNA damage, which is required for efficient repair of DSBs
				- Removal of UV-induced DNA photoproducts depends on JNK phosphorylation of DGCR8 on serine 153
				- apoptosis, neurodegeneration, T cell differentiation and cell proliferation, inflammatory conditions and cytokine production mediated by AP-1 activation protein 1 (such as RANTES, IL-8 and GM-CSF)
				- activates the ubiquitin ligase Itch
		- miR-101 microRNA precursor
			- small non-coding RNA that regulates gene expression
			- hsa-miR-101 is associated with survival in multiple breast cancer datasets
		- YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1, also known as YAP or YAP65)
			- Dysregulation of YAP/TAZ-mediated transcriptional activity is implicated in the development of abnormal cell growth and hyperactivation of YAP and TAZ has been observed amongst many cancers
			- however, while YAP has been identified as a proto-oncogene, it can also act as a tumor suppressor depending on cellular context
			- a protein that acts as a transcription coregulator that promotes transcription of genes involved in cellular proliferation and suppressing apoptotic genes
			- component in the hippo signaling pathway which regulates organ size, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. 
			- identified by its ability to associate with the SH3 domain of Yes and Src protein tyrosine kinases
			- a potent oncogene, which is amplified in various human cancers, driven by its association with the TEAD family of transcription factors, which up-regulate genes that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis
			- several genes are regulated by YAP1, including Birc2, Birc5, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), amphiregulin (AREG), Cyr61, Hoxa1 and Hoxc13
			- acts as a stiffness sensor
			- other functional partners of YAP1 were identified, including RUNX, SMADs, p73, ErbB4, TP53BP2, LATS1/2, PTPN14, AMOTs, and ZO1/2
			- YAP1 and its close paralog, TAZ (WWTR1), are the main effectors of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway
		- CIP2A (cancerous inhibitor of PP2A, a protein encoded by the KIAA1524 gene)
			- CIP2A is over-expressed in cancer
			- PP2A complexes can dephosphorylate a vast majority of all cellular serine/threonine phosphorylated proteins including large number of phosphoproteins involved in cancer maintenance and progression
			- The functional role of PP2A as a human tumor suppressor was demonstrated where normal human cells immortalized by overexpression of TERT and inhibition of p53 and Rb, could not be transformed by oncogenic forms of H-Ras without simultaneous inhibition of PP2A activity
				- increased activity of oncogenic kinases is not sufficient to drive human cell transformation if PP2A activity is not simultaneously inhibited
			- In striking contrast to the tumor suppressor p53, which in human tumors is mainly inactivated by mutations, PP2A complex proteins are mutated at low frequency and rather seem to be inhibited by overexpression of PP2A inhibitor proteins such as CIP2A, PME-1 and SET
			- CIP2A inhibits PP2A tumor suppressor activity
				- More specifically, CIP2A was demonstrated to inhibit PP2A activity towards oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, and thereby prevent c-Myc proteolytic degradation
				- CIP2A is required for the malignant cellular growth and for in vivo tumor formation
				- overexpression of CIP2A promotes Ras-elicited cell growth and transforms immortalized human cells (HEK-TERVs)
				- CIP2A regulates phosphorylation and activity of many other oncoproteins and to drive malignant cell growth and tumorigenesis
		- Myc (oncogene) is a family of regulator genes and proto-oncogenes that code for transcription factors
			- c-MYC
				- In cancer, c-myc is often upregulated and constitutively (persistently) expressed
					- This leads to the increased expression of many genes, some of which are involved in cell proliferation, contributing to the formation of cancer
				- any anti-cancer drugs for Myc dysregulation will require acting on the protein indirectly, such as by targeting the mRNA for the protein rather than a small molecule that targets the protein itself
				- regulate expression of 15% of all genes
				- role in cell competition
				- activate expression of many pro-proliferative genes through:
					- binding on enhancer box sequences (E-boxes)
					- recruiting histone acetyltransferases (HATs), allowing it to regulate global chromatin structure via histone acetylation
				- pregulating transcript elongation of actively transcribed genes through the recruitment of transcriptional elongation factors
				- It can also act as a transcriptional repressor
					- By binding Miz-1 transcription factor and displacing the p300 co-activator, it inhibits expression of Miz-1 target genes
				- In addition, myc has a direct role in the control of DNA replication
					- This activity could contribute to DNA amplification in cancer cells
			- myc activation
				- Myc is activated upon various mitogenic signals such as serum stimulation or by Wnt, Shh and EGF (via the MAPK/ERK pathway)
			- myc activation effects
				- By modifying the expression of its target genes, Myc activation results in numerous biological effects
					- drive cell proliferation (upregulates cyclins, downregulates p21)
					- regulating cell growth (upregulates ribosomal RNA and proteins), apoptosis (downregulates Bcl-2), differentiation, and stem cell self-renewal
					- upregulates nucleotide metabolism genes, which are necessary for Myc induced proliferation or cell growth
				- B cell proliferation, and gain of MYC has been associated with B cell malignancies and their increased aggressiveness, including histological transformation.
				- In B cells, Myc regulates a number of pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways, including tuning of BCR signaling and CD40 signaling in regulation of microRNAs (miR-29, miR-150, miR-17-92)
				- c-Myc induces MTDH(AEG-1) gene expression and in turn itself requires AEG-1 oncogene for its expression
			- Myc inhibitors
				- inhibit Nucleotide Metabolism
					- 6-Benzylthioinosine (depletes ATP)
					- mycophenolic acid 
						- can cause cancer, but can also induce apoptosis through guanine nucleotide depletion
						- also inhibits mTORC1, induces caspase 3-dependent apoptosis, reduces p70S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, and mediates decreases in MYC and cyclin D protein translation, due to depletion of GTP
				- inhibit Glutamine Metabolism
					- Glutamine, typically a non-essential amino acid, has been shown to be an important source of energy for cancer cells
					- p32 has been shown to be a direct target of MYC, and is important for MYC control of glutamine metabolism
					- Mitochondrial protein SIRT4 represses the effects of MYC on glutamine metabolism, and can synergize with glycolytic inhibitors and induce cell death
					- Lactate levels themselves can serve to modulate the degree of glycolysis versus glutaminolysis within cells via HIF-1α and MYC activation
					- Within liver tumors, inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1), and within colorectal cancer cells, N-Myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2), function as suppressors of MYC function that further impact cellular metabolism
					- In prostate cancer, prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) is a long coding RNA that can interact with MYC directly and enhance its activity
					- Among the 14-3-3 proteins, 14-3-3σ is capable of enhancing ubiquitination and degradation of MYC, and functions as a key regulator of cell metabolism in breast cancer cells

					- mTOR inhibitors (Rapamycin, Temsirolimus, Icariside)
					- Diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) inhibits GLUT-1, LDH-A, and MCT1 expression in cancer cell lines, along with decreased MYC activity, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and tumor growth
				- moringa, trichostatin: inhibition of this enzyme histone deacetylase 6 leads to a significant decrease in Myc concentration
		- Wnt (proto-oncogene)/β-catenin pathway
			- Wnt signaling pathways are a group of signal transduction pathways which begin with proteins that pass signals into a cell through cell surface receptors
				- use either nearby cell-cell communication (paracrine) or same-cell communication (autocrine)
				- Three Wnt signaling pathways have been characterized, all of which are activated by the binding Wnt-protein ligand to a Frizzled family receptor, which passes the biological signal to the Dishevelled protein inside the cell
					- The canonical Wnt pathway leads to regulation of gene transcription, and is thought to be negatively regulated in part by the SPATS1 gene
						- canonical pathway involves the protein beta-catenin (β-catenin) 
					- The noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway regulates the cytoskeleton that is responsible for the shape of the cell
					- The noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway regulates calcium inside the cell
				- genetic mutations in Wnt pathway proteins influenced cancer development
				- Wnt signaling also controls tissue regeneration in adult bone marrow, skin and intestine
			- involved in embryonic development, which often calls for rapid cell division and migration. Misregulation of these processes can lead to tumor development via excess cell proliferation
			- Canonical Wnt pathway activity is involved in the development of benign and malignant breast tumors
				- Its presence is revealed by elevated levels of β-catenin in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm
				- Increased β-catenin expression is correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients
				- This accumulation may be due to factors such as mutations in β-catenin, deficiencies in the β-catenin destruction complex, most frequently by mutations in structurally disordered regions of APC, overexpression of Wnt ligands, loss of inhibitors and/or decreased activity of regulatory pathways (such as the Wnt/calcium pathway)
				- Wnt involvement in EMT can lead to metastasis
					- repression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can prevent EMT, which can inhibit metastasis
				- Changes in CTNNB1 expression (the gene that encodes β-catenin) can be measured in cancers
				- Increased expression of Wnt ligand-proteins such as Wnt1, Wnt2 and Wnt7A were observed in the development of cancer
				- Other proteins that cause multiple cancer types in the absence of proper functioning include ROR1, ROR2, SFRP4, Wnt5A, WIF1 and those of the TCF/LEF family
				- Wnt is down-regulated during the dormancy stage by autocrine DKK1 to avoid immune surveillance, as well as during the dissemination stages by intracellular Dact1.
				- Meanwhile Wnt is activated during the early outgrowth phase by E-selectin
				- The link between PGE2 and Wnt suggests that a chronic inflammation-related increase of PGE2 may lead to activation of the Wnt pathway in different tissues, resulting in carcinogenesis
		- HSF1
			- cancer cells use HSF1, so inhibiting HSF1 can be useful
		- PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase)
			- Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer
			- PI3Ks are intracellular signal transducer enzymes that can phosphorylate the 3 position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)
				- The pathway, with oncogene PIK3CA and tumor suppressor gene PTEN, is implicated in the sensitivity of cancer tumors to insulin and IGF1, and in calorie restriction
			- Many of these functions relate to the ability of class I PI3Ks to activate protein kinase B (PKB, aka Akt) as in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
			- The p110Δ  and p110γ isoforms regulate different aspects of immune responses
			- PI3Ks are also a key component of the insulin signaling pathway
			- PI3K is also involved in interleukin signalling (IL4)
		- Protein kinase B (PKB), also known as Akt (oncogene)
			- set of three serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that are involved in multiple cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, cell migration, angiogenesis
			- Akt is regulated by Ubiquitination/phosphorylation
			- Akt inhibitors may treat cancers such as neuroblastoma
		- mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)
			- a kinase that in humans is encoded by the MTOR gene
			- mTOR is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family of protein kinases
			- mTOR links with other proteins and serves as a core component of two distinct protein complexes, mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2, which regulate different cellular processes
				- In particular, as a core component of both complexes, mTOR functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, autophagy, and transcription
				- As a core component of mTORC2, mTOR also functions as a tyrosine protein kinase that promotes the activation of insulin receptors and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors
				- mTORC2 has also been implicated in the control and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton
		- Serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) also known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1) or renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-19
			- a protein kinase encoded by the STK11 gene that functions as a tumour suppressor
			- LKB1 exerts its growth suppressing effects by activating a group of 14 other kinases, comprising AMPK and AMPK-related kinases
			- Activation of AMPK by LKB1 suppresses growth and proliferation when energy and nutrient levels are scarce	
		- Androgen receptor (AR)
			- expressed in cancers
		- Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)
			- a transcription factor that in humans is encoded by the NFE2L2 gene
			- NRF2 is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein
			- NRF2 may regulate the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage triggered by injury and inflammation
			- NRF2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of genes encoding cytoprotective proteins
			- NRF2 induces the expression of heme oxygenase 1, leading to an increase in phase II enzymes
			- NRF2 also inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome
			- NRF2 appears to participate in a complex regulatory network and performs a pleiotropic role in the regulation of metabolism, inflammation, autophagy, proteostasis, mitochondrial physiology, and immune responses
		- HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1 gene) encodes the enzyme heme oxygenase 1
			- HO-1 deficiency in normal cells enhances DNA damage and carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, HO-1 overexpression in cancer cells promotes proliferation and survival

        - inhibit inflammatory pathways
		- signaling pathways
			- MAPK/ERK pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway)	
				- a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell
					- 1. start the MAPK/ERK pathway by 'binding of extracellular mitogen to a cell surface receptor', which allows a Ras protein (a Small GTPase) to swap a GDP molecule for a GTP molecule, flipping the "on/off switch" of the pathway
						- Ras activation
							- Receptor-linked tyrosine kinases (such as cell surface receptors like EGFR, Trk A/B, Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) or PDGFR), are activated by extracellular ligands (such as the epidermal growth factor EGF)
								- Binding of EGF to the EGFR activates the tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor
									- The EGFR becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues
										- Docking proteins such as GRB2 contain an SH2 domain that binds to the phosphotyrosine residues of the activated receptor
											- GRB2 binds to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS by way of the two SH3 domains of GRB2
												- When the GRB2-SOS complex docks to phosphorylated EGFR, SOS becomes activated
													- Activated SOS then promotes the removal of GDP from a member of the Ras subfamily (most notably H-Ras or K-Ras)
														- The Ras protein can then bind GTP and become active
					- 2. The Ras protein can then activate MAP3K (such as Raf), which activates MAP2K, which activates MAPK
						- protein kinase cascade (activated Ras can activates MAP3K, which activates MAP2K, which activates MAPK)
							- Activated Ras activates the protein kinase activity of a RAF kinase
								- RAF kinase then phosphorylates and activates a MAPK/ERK Kinase (MEK1 or MEK2)
									- MEK then phosphorylates and activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
							- RAF and MAPK/ERK are both serine/threonine-specific protein kinases, where MEK is a serine/tyrosine/threonine kinase
							- targeting this cascade can target feedback regulation and signal amplification
					- 3. Regulation of translation and transcription (MAPK activates a transcription factor, such as Myc)
						- One effect of MAPK activation is to alter the translation of mRNA to proteins
						- MAPK phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK)
							- This activates RSK, which, in turn, phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6
						- MAPK regulates the activities of several transcription factors
							- MAPK can phosphorylate C-myc
							- MAPK phosphorylates and activates MNK, which, in turn, phosphorylates CREB (a cellular transcription factor)
							- MAPK also regulates the transcription of the C-Fos gene (a proto-oncogene)
							- By altering the levels and activities of transcription factors, MAPK leads to altered transcription of genes that are important for the cell cycle
				- When one of the proteins in the pathway is mutated, it can become stuck in the "on" or "off" position, a necessary step in the development of many cancers
					- treatments switch one of these steps on/off
						- Raf kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, SB590885, PLX4720, XL281, RAF265, encorafenib, dabrafenib, vemurafenib)

			- rS6 (ribosomal protein S6)
				- a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is therefore involved in translation
				- phosphorylation of eS6 is involved in the regulation of cell size, cell proliferation, and glucose homeostasis
				- p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) and p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSK) both phosphorylate eS6 and that S6K1 and S6K2 predominate this function
				- Pathways leading to the induction of human eS6 phosphorylation have been found to enhance IL-8 protein synthesis

			- upregulating APC can downregulate B-catenin
			- triggered by EBV to trigger cancer
		- histone methyltransferase G9a
			- by methylating H3K9, P53 protein and L1G1, histone methyltransferase G9a plays an important role in many biological processes
			- Euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2), also known as G9a, is a histone methyltransferase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the EHMT2 gene
			- Epigenetic abnormalities can lead to serious diseases such as cancer in organisms
			- Histone methylation is one of the several manifestations of epigenetics, and requires specific enzymes to catalyze, for example, G9a, which is a histone methyl transferase
			- G9a catalyzes the methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27)
			- G9a also plays an essential role in DNA replication, damage and repair, and gene expression by regulating DNA methylation
			- G9a has been found to be overexpressed in many tumor cells and is associated with the occurrence and development of tumors
			- inhibit histone methyltransferase G9a, which is known to be involved in cancerogenesis

		- decrease AP-2α to deactivate EZH2
			- AP-2α facilitates melanoma metastasis through transcriptional activation of genes within the E2F pathway including EZH2
		- inhibit miR-26a to increase AP-2α to decrease MGMT
			- miR-26a decreased AP-2α expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of AP-2α and reversed the tumor suppressive role of AP-2α in glioma
		- increase AP-2α expression to decrease MGMT
			- AP-2α indirectly downregulated Nanog expression by inhibiting the interleukin 6/janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL6/JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway, consequently decreasing O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression
		- decrease MGMT
			- DNA repair protein, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), can confer resistance to guanine O6-alkylating agents
			- Therefore, inhibition of resistant MGMT protein is a practical approach to increase the anticancer effects of such alkylating agents
			- Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Wnt activity downregulates MGMT expression and restores chemosensitivity of DNA-alkylating drugs
			- O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is an antimutagenic DNA repair protein highly expressed in human brain tumors. Because MGMT repairs the mutagenic, carcinogenic and cytotoxic O(6)-alkylguanine adducts, including those generated by the clinically used anticancer alkylating agents, it has emerged as a central and rational target for overcoming tumor resistance to alkylating agents
				- MGMT posttranslational regulation by ubiquitination, sumoylation and glutathionylation and reveals how the reactivity of the active site Cys145 can be exploited for potent inhibition and depletion of MGMT by thiol-reacting drugs
				- thiol-reacting drugs include disulfiram and various dithiocarbamate derivatives

		- TEM8 inhibition
			- Tumor cells require nutrients to survive, and without them, they would normally die. However, tumor support cells use TEM8 to consume and break down collagen into glutamine to feed nearby tumor cells, allowing them to thrive even without a secure supply of nutrients
			- Tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8), also known as anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1), is a highly conserved cell-surface protein overexpressed on tumor-infiltrating vasculature
			- antibodies developed against the TEM8 extracellular domain blocked anthrax intoxication, inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis, displayed broad antitumor activity, and augmented the activity of clinically approved anticancer agents without added toxicity
		- akt inhibition
			- The activity of Akt is negatively regulated by PTEN, SHIP and CTMP, so upregulating those could be useful as inhibitors of akt

	- activate anti-cancer genes/proteins
		- activate anti-cancer genes by inhibiting Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 blocks these genes)
			- Brevinin-2R, MDA-7, Noxa, TRAIL
		- activate anti-cancer genes by phosphorylation
			- Apoptin, E4orf4, NS1, PAR-4
		- Apoptin
			- apoptin can detect early oncogenic change. Apoptin seems to detect signals of survival in cancer cells, which it can reroute into impulses for cell death
			- causes p53-deficient tumor-specific apoptosis
			- Apoptin is mostly nuclear and phosphorylated in tumor cells, whereas it is cytoplasmic and unphosphorylated in normal cells, where it is easily neutralized
			- attacks transforming cells while leaving untransformed cells unharmed
			- independent of p53, induces apoptosis through an intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway
			- unlike other PCD pathways, the pathway of Apoptin is independent of death receptors
			- In normal functioning cells, this 13.6-kDa protein resides in the cytoplasm, yet in cancerous cells, it travels to the nucleus via phosphorylation at the Thr-108 position via the mitogenic cyclin dependent kinase (CDK2)
			- Several Apoptin-interacting molecules are needed in order for Apoptin to be fully functional (DNA, clyclinA-CDK2, and fas-associated death domain protein (FADD))
		- Brevinin-2R 
			- antimicrobial non-hemolytic defensin (in contrast to the majority of peptides within the Brevinine family)
			- semi-selective towards cancer cells and leaves non-cancerous cells largely unharmed
			- arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, resulting in an induction of apoptosis
			- Brevinin-2R works to trigger cell death by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in lower cellular ATP levels while simultaneously increasing the concentration of reactive oxygen species
			- Brevinins have been shown to promote insulin release
			- increases the rate of tissue regeneration
		- Early region 4 open-reading-frame 4 (E4orf4)
			- an adenovirus protein of 14kDa which regulates growth in all stages of the adenovirus (Ad) infection
			- partners mainly with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and Src kinases to induce cell death
			- induces apoptosis in a p53 and caspase-independent manner
		- HAMLET
			- anticancer protein complex found in breast milk
			- Apoptosis occurs through activation of three different pathways:
				- intrinsic, extrinsic, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
				- HAMLET proceeds by both a multifaceted intrinsic pathway and the caspase cascade, a subsection of the TNF pathway
					- First, after uptake by the cell, HAMLET proceeds to the mitochondria and depolarize the membranes at cytochrome c
						- Consequently, mitochondria dependent apoptosis factors are released as well as the caspase cascade is activated
					- Second, proteasomes are targeted by HAMLET through a mechanism that is less understood
						- HAMLET directly binds to the proteasome leading to its inhibition
					- Third, HAMLET has been found to target the nucleus, specifically histones
						- HAMLET irreversibly binds to histones leading to the inactivation of transcription and chromatin condensation, which inevitably causes apoptosis
					- Lastly, studies show that cells treated by HAMLET exhibit behaviors common to macroautophagy
						- This includes presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, double-membrane vesicles, and a dose-dependent decrease in ATP levels
		- Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7), and also known as IL-24, classified in the interleukin IL-10
			- increasing mda-7 expression in tumor cells results in growth arrest and cell death in many different cell lines
				- When mda-7 is over-expressed in normal cells, no change in growth or cell viability is detected
			- mda-7 is also considered a radio-sensitizing cytokine because it generates a reactive oxygen species and causes stress in endoplasmic reticulum
			- mda-7 has been used in several clinical trials because of its ability to induce apoptosis, prevent tumor angiogenesis, cause immune-regulation, and increase radiation lethality.
		- Noxa (member of the Bcl-2 family)
			- regulates cell death through a variety of intracellular stress signals
			- on receiving intrinsic death signals, the gene NOXA encodes for the protein Noxa, which binds to anti-apoptotic proteins resulting in these proteins' inhibition
			- As a p53 inducible gene, NOXA is transcribed and translated to Noxa in response to DNA damage and hypoxia induced apoptosis
			- initiates apoptosis through Bax-mediated mitochondrial-dysfunction, through the inhibition of the Bcl2 family's antiapoptotic members
			- involved in the maintenance of memory CD4+ T Th1/Th2 cell homeostasis 
		- NS1
			- small regulatory protein with different functions that inevitably lead to apoptosis and cell death
			- NS1 activates cell death through two different pathways, apoptosis/lysosomal-like programmed cell death and necrosis/cytolysis
			- causes release of many reactive oxygen species, causing DNA damage, at which point a DNA damage response occurs, which in this case results in cell death
		- Organic Cation Transporter Like-3 (ORCTL3) 
			- transporter for urate
			- ORCTL3 transfection into numerous tumorigenic cells induced apoptosis, while normal and primary cells remained healthy
		- Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4)
			- tumor suppressor protein with a pro-apoptotic function
		- Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
			- homotrimer of TRAIL binds three molecules of either TRAIL-receptor 1 or 2, which are transmembrane proteins that contain a cytoplasmic death domain
				- Once TRAIL is bound, Fas, caspase-8, and caspase-10 associate with the death domain forming death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that proceeds through two different mechanisms depending on the cell type
					- In one cell type, DISC can directly activate the effector caspase leading to apoptosis
					- in the other the complex activates a bcl-2-mediated pathway in a similar fashion as HAMLET that results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which then causes the activation of effector caspase.
				- the latter mechanism is the focus of many oncogenic therapies because p53, the tumor suppressor gene, activates the same pathway
					- Since cancer is commonly caused by the inactivation of p53, TRAIL could mediate this effect by still activating the apoptotic pathway
		- KLF4
			- Overexpression of KLF4 acts as a tumor suppressor in acute promyelocytic leukemia
		- UBE2L3
			- when mRNA genes UBE2L3 and CYP1A1 are over-expressed or activated, HPV activity is suppressed
		- CYP1A1
			- when mRNA genes UBE2L3 and CYP1A1 are over-expressed or activated, HPV activity is suppressed
		- Rb/pRb (Retinoblastoma protein)
			- pRb was the first tumor-suppressor protein discovered in human retinoblastoma
			- however, recent evidence has also implicated pRb as a tumor-survival factor
			- blocks cell proliferation, regulates cell division and cell death
				- prevents the cell cycle progression from G1 phase into the S phase by binding to E2F and repressing the necessary gene transcription (prevents the cell from replicating its DNA if there is damage)
		- BCL2 (family of proteins)
			- can induce or inhibit apoptosis
			- maintain composition of the mitochondria membrane
			- prevent cytochrome c release into the cytosol (When cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria, it starts a signaling cascade to begin apoptosis)
		- SWI/SNF (chromatin remodeling complex, encoded by 20 genes, which when mutated lead to misfolding and disrupt the complex's function)
			- SWI/SNF has the ability move nucleosomes, which condenses DNA, allowing for transcription or block transcription from occurring for certain genes
			- Mutating this ability could cause genes to be turned on or off at the wrong times
		- p53 (TP53 gene encode protein p53)
			- involved in DNA repair, inducing apoptosis, transcription, and regulating the cell cycle
			- tumor-suppressing transcription factor (TF), which can recognize when there is an alteration in a cell's DNA caused by factors including chemical toxins, radiation, ultraviolet (UV) rays, and other damaging agents
			- Crucially, p53 plays a role in determining whether the damaged genetic material in the cell can be repaired, or if the cell should be destroyed through apoptosis
		- Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (also known as pVHL, is encoded by VHL gene)
			- involved in ubiquitination/degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)
				- HIFs are transcription factors that play a central role regulating gene expression in response to changing oxygen levels
				- Under normal oxygen levels, HIF1α binds pVHL through 2 hydroxylated proline residues and is polyubiquitinated by pVHL
					- this leads to its degradation via the proteasome
				- During hypoxia, the proline residues are not hydroxylated and pVHL cannot bind
					- HIF1α causes the transcription of genes that contain the hypoxia response element
			- main action of the VHL protein is thought to be its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that results in specific target proteins being 'marked' for degradation.
				- hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), a transcription factor that induces the expression of a number of angiogenesis related factors
					- HIFs are necessary for tumor growth because most cancers demand high metabolic activity and are only supplied by structurally or functionally inadequate vasculature
					- Activation of HIFs allow for enhanced angiogenesis, which in turn allow for increased glucose uptake
			- Suggested targets for VHL-related cancers include targets of the HIF pathway, such as VEGF
				- Inhibitors of VEGF receptor sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and recently axitinib have been approved by the FDA
				- The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin analogs everolimus and temsirolimus or VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab may also be an option
				- iron, 2-oxoglutarate and oxygen are necessary for the inactivation of HIF
					- it has been theorized that a lack of these cofactors could reduce the ability of hydroxylases in inactivating HIF
					- cells with a high activation of HIF (even in oxygenated environments) was reversed by supplying the cells with ascorbate
					- Thus, Vitamin C may be a potential treatment for HIF induced tumors
		- APC/C activator protein CDH1
			- Cdh1 functions as a tumour suppressor
				- Cdh1-deficient cells can proliferate but accumulate mitotic errors and have difficulties with cytokinesis
				- It has been shown that APCCdh1-mediated degradation of PIk1 plays an important role in preventing mitosis in cells that have DNA-damage
				- In healthy cells Cdh1 stays inactive from late G1 to early mitosis
				- It stays inactive in early mitosis and only becomes active in the transition from late mitosis to G1
				- A cell that suffers from DNA-damage shows an active Cdh1 already in late G1 and therefore blocks the mitotic entry
				- One substrate of APCCdh1 is the transcription factor Ets2, which is activated by the Ras-Raf-MAPK signalling pathway and induces the expression of cyclin D1
					- This pathway stimulates cell proliferation
					- It was shown that an increased expression of Ets2 can be associated with various cancer types
		- BRCA2
			- tumor suppressor gene
			- its protein, also called by the synonym breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein, is responsible for repairing DNA or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired
			- repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double strand breaks
			- If BRCA1 or BRCA2 itself is damaged by a BRCA mutation, damaged DNA is not repaired properly, and this increases the risk for breast cancer
		- NF1
			- neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a gene that codes for neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein
				- neurofibromin negatively regulates RAS/MAPK pathway activity by accelerating the hydrolysis of Ras-bound GTP
				- NF1 has a high mutation rate and mutations in NF1 can alter cellular growth control, and neural development, resulting in neurofibromatosis type 1 and tumors
		- Protein patched homolog 1 protein (PTCH, member of the patched family, encoded by the PTCH1 gene)
			- the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1 is the receptor for sonic hedgehog, a secreted molecule implicated in the formation of embryonic structures and in tumorigenesis
			- the PTCH1 gene product is a transmembrane protein that suppresses the release of the 'smoothened' protein
				- when sonic hedgehog binds PTCH1, smoothened is released and signals cell proliferation
			- Mutations of this gene have been associated with cancer
		- PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) 
			- a tumor suppressor gene encoding a protein PTEN, which possesses lipid and protein phosphatase-dependent as well as phosphatase-independent activities
			- PTEN protein phosphatase is able to interfere with MET signaling by dephosphorylating either PIP3 generated by PI3K, or the p52 isoform of SHC
			- SHC dephosphorylation inhibits recruitment of the GRB2 adapter to activated MET
