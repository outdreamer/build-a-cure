- interface analysis search report, intl PCT/US20/50591

	- general comments
		- every program involves an equivalence check of some sort, where an explicit data type check or an implicit state/process check or other input metric - but that doesnt make it equivalent to my method of 'comparing any structure with any other structure after standardizing it to a custom primary interface which is a standardizing filter with a special meaning that indicates it can be used to solve any problem', but I understand why someone who isnt good at comparing things would have trouble identifying the difference between the two
