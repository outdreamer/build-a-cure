	- general comments
		- 'apply AI to connect all inputs/outputs' is a method of 'connecting inputs/outputs', but it's absolutely not a novel method and it's certainly not equivalent to my invention, which offers an alternative to replace AI

- interface analysis search report, intl PCT/US20/50591

	- general comments
		- every program involves an equivalence check of some sort, where an explicit data type check or an implicit state/process check or other input metric - but that doesnt make it equivalent to my method of 'comparing any structure with any other structure after standardizing it to a custom primary interface which is a standardizing filter with a special meaning that indicates it can be used to solve any problem', but I understand why someone who isnt good at comparing things would have trouble identifying the difference between the two

				- abstract
					"The present invention is directed to the field of electronic content management and more particularly to a method, system and computer program for automatically generating electronic content based on a user designed table of contents and a desired final content form. Language identification and automatic machine translation technologies are also used to broaden the sources of information, The method comprises the steps of: extracting from the unstructured data, information related to one or a plurality of preselected topics; consolidating the extracted information in a structured form; localizing the consolidated information according to a selected environment; generating content according to a specified form."

				- differences
					- their invention can convert an e-book or a web page into a set of keywords or a different e-book or web page with synonyms replacing the original words, but it cannot convert it into an insight-generating algorithm like my invention can
					- their invention determines relevance on a single metric 'similarity', which is the default metric of relevance/usefulness/meaning used by thousands of other algorithms, and is only one structure used in my system which uses thousands of other useful structures & identifies new useful structures as needed
					- their invention requires user configuration of a text-generating algorithm
					- their invention solves an entirely different problem of 'generating example content given a domain reference network & an output template', whereas my invention solves the problem of 'automating problem-solving'
					- their invention depends on trivial combinations of known machine-learning methods, whereas my invention relies on definitions of interfaces on which any problem can be solved (intent, cause, potential, meaning)

				- similarities to my & other inventions
					- there are many thousands of programs that generate content in a specific form based on an input template specified by the user, which is a minor detail of my invention that is dynamically generated, rather than being a statically defined function to do nothing other than fulfill a template
					- there are many thousands of standardization algorithms, none of which standardize information to a structure even remotely similar to that used as input to my invention
					- there are many thousands of feature-extraction, relation-extraction, and filtering methods in the machine-learning domain, none of which are similar to my invention
					- there are many thousands of similarity-calculation algorithms, none of which use interfaces to highlight differences & make comparison trivial, nor do they use interface structures like problem/solution structures or cause/intent structures to determine similarity, they just use comparison of vector angles/magnitude or some other well-known method or trivial adjustment to it
					- there are many thousands of entity-extraction tools because its an extremely trivial & standard known process with a known solution

				- abstract
					- "A contextual analysis engine systematically extracts, analyzes and organizes digital content stored in an electronic file such as a webpage. Content can be extracted using a text extraction module which is capable of separating the content which is to be analyzed from less meaningful content such as format specifications and programming scripts. The resulting unstructured corpus of plain text can then be passed to a text analytics module capable of generating a structured categorization of topics included within the content. This structured categorization can be organized based on a content topic ontology which may have been previously defined or which may be developed in real-time. The systems disclosed herein optionally include an input/output interface capable of managing workflows of the text extraction module and the text analytics module, administering a cache of previously generated results, and interfacing with other applications that leverage the disclosed contextual analysis services."

				- differences
					- their invention is basically 'apply AI to extract & tag text with categories' which has been implemented countless times by many people in very similar ways as their 'invention'
