- math interface interactions (connecting functions)

    - connection-connecting methods

      - given how values can be connected, how can connections be connected using those value-connecting connections

        - how can connections be formatted as absolute references (numbers) so value-connecting connections can be applied to connect connections

        - given that a function A connects 2 & 10, and so does function B, function B is connected to function A by change types & operations that preserve the input/output relationship for that case

        - in the space of connections, function A & B have a similarity in position

        - the efficiencies connecting two absolute references may replace another function connecting those references

          - given the adjacence of 2 & 10 to each other, it may be more efficient to use this similarity to connect them (by transforming one to the other) than using other connections (either as similarities or differences) such as multiply by 5 or divide 20 by 10
          
          - or it may be more efficient to transform 2 to 1 given its similarity to 1 and use unit multiplication (1 * 10 = 10, requiring no change) and transforming 1 back to two through addition (10 + 10 = 2 * 10) rather than multiplying 2 * 10
          
          - this efficiency is generated from the metadata of these two numbers, metadata that may connect them more efficiently than other operations
            
            - example queries:
              - "apply the prime interface to connect numbers adjacent to primes" (adjacence given common factor pattern)
              - "apply the unit interface to connect references adjacent to unit references" (adjacence to 1)
              - "apply the difference interface to connect reference differences adjacent to a more computable/optimizable/efficient difference" (the difference between 2 & 10 is adjacent to the difference between 1 & 10)
              - "apply the unit interface to the difference interface (find the core component of difference), then the alternative interface (replacing multiplication with addition)"

              - interface queries can be framed as structural paths:
                - value query: 
                  - "take the prime network until you hit the unit network or am ambiguity, then take the difference sequence in the direction of increasing difference until you get to the target value"
                - function query: 
                  - "apply area operations (integral/derivative) until you reach a connection that can be reduced to coefficient operations (multiplication) or sequence operations (progressions, sums)"
                  - "apply difference operations (adding new difference types in values) until predictions of highly non-adjacent values are similar to actual values (converge)"
                  - "derive difference types in known input-output connections (local data) until interactive difference types (emerging in non-local data) are predictable with a degree of certainty"
                  - "determine difference types that are quickest to filter out (prove wrong), given common difference type patterns"

        - connection-connecting methods can be connected with interface components
          
          - apply interface component 'opposite'
            - a function connecting 2 & 10 has an 'opposite' structure applied to the attribute of 'direction', in the form of a function connecting 10 & 2
            - this absolute reference (opposite direction) connects these connection types (functions) just like -1 is connected to 1 by an opposite structure applied to the attribute of 'direction'

          - apply interfaces to get the metadata of a function (like we applied interfaces to get the metadata of values below)
            - this will produce other functions that may be efficient in some way, possibly more efficient than the original function at many of its intents

          - given that values can be connected with value-connecting metadata, functions can be connected with function-connecting metadata (and value-connecting metadata, given that values are components of functions and functions can be represented as values)
            - just like 2 & 10 can be connected by their adjacence to primes, to each other, and to 1, functions can be connected by their adjacence to each other & to unit functions

          - these absolute reference connections can be used to connect difference types
            - "apply 'opposite direction' operations to connect a component to another, if they can be connected with a sequence structure (they exist or change in a space where a path can connect them, or in spaces that can be connected with a path)"

    - absolute reference-connecting methods

      - what is the complete set of unique connections between two values (numbers being absolute references), such as numbers like 2 & 10

        - their metadata is connected with:

          - similarities:

            - components
              - inputs
                - factors (common factors)

            - abstractions
              - types
                - value types (integers)

            - system contexts (relevance through usefulness)
              - applications
                - common usage (commonly used as bases)
                - usage potential (can be used to produce useful functions, sequences, & sets, like even numbers or digit-moving functions)

            - relevant components

              - relevance through adjacence in position
                - adjacent value metadata (both near primes, e, pi, 1, & zero)

              - relevance through interactivity
                - interactive with value-connecting metadata (metadata like number types)
                  - intersections
                    - 2 intersects with primes formatted as a sequential path (sequence of primes) or a network (formatted by adjacence to other primes, adjacence to other high-energy numbers, or other highly connecting metadata) or a function (checking for factors qualifying as those of a prime)
                    - sequence of even numbers

          - differences like:

            - adjacent transforms, formats, & applications

              - usage
                - power
                  - 2 or its inverse is more commonly used as a power than 10 bc its one away from the unit power 1
            
            - difference-reducing connections
              - operations
                - factors connecting the two numbers with multiplication/division like 5 & 20
      
      - these values can store different info with varying optimization/efficiency & varying info loss/preservation
      - given the ways that change types like variables/operations are connected in functions, what functions efficiently connect values like the above pair, using minimal info, and for what intents

    - determine connections between useful alternative concepts for formatting (concepts like energy, entropy, random) to work around lack of other interface info
      - energy (in the form of cross-system interface components can be stored in structures varying on cross-system interface component variables
          - components like type, change, similarity, simplicity, stability, ambiguity, symmetry, interactivity, limit, efficiency, connectivity, & info preservation/compression
            - a structure that can store some info has adjacent storage structures that can also store that info or a subset/parameters of it
      - the connectivity of these structures can be determined by the energy preservation/loss from origin/target structure and the structures enabling structures connecting them
      - these concepts are useful & structural enough that they can be used as metadata of a problem/solution that circumvents the need to structurize a problem
        - if you know the energy components of a problem and a solution, you can connect them with energy functions without structurizing the problem
          - example:
            - if a problem is 'optimizing a system that wastes energy or degrades without maintenance processes', and the solution is a method like 'connect energy outputs with energy inputs', these can be connected in either direction using energy metadata of interim steps/structures like 'apply energy usage-reducing components like connections' (to connect inputs/outputs), where energy is defined as common abstract structures like 'source of change', 'output', 'input:output ratio', 'potential', 'robustness'
      - these concepts are useful bc they:
        - can reduce info to its most relevant structures
          - involve structures of relevance (commonness, abstraction, connection)
        - apply to all interface components
          - can be defined across interfaces (with alternative definitions that apply directly to interface components)
      - alternate energy formats:
        - light
          - light-filtering structures & containing structures like vacillations in a range (waves) around a symmetry (average) given a change-governing force (gravity)
          - how would you format info as light
            - light distributes/highlights/focuses energy on specific components, like objects within a distance range from a position, along a trajectory, at an angle, or with a particular interactive structure that absorbs or reflects light
            - info has similar structures, like difference from origin info, info connectible on a path, info visible from a perspective angle, or interaction with info-absorbing/storing/reflecting structures like black holes or encryption algorithms
