      - apply workflows until 'minimum info required to check if it has at least one successful example' is reached
        - example: finding out whether a workflow or solution-finding method has at least one successful example is trivial, and finding out which workflows can reach this example is trivial in the set of core workflows, and once a succesful example is achieved, changes can be applied to the original core workflow to improve the next application of the workflow variant

      - apply interface structures to identify new variables
        - example: to identify a new variable of a structure like a 'song' with core structures like 'notes', apply interface structures (like 'subset') to other interface structures (like 'time' in the 'physical information' interface of the 'information' interface), to generate 'intervals of notes'

      - apply interface structures to filter structures as being more probably true or false
        - example: if there is no 'reason to support a theory', it doesnt have to automatically be considered true and is a candidate for a falsehood, like when someone's actions dont match their words, as 'words' are the far more easily controlled variable than 'actions', so 'words' are more easily faked than 'actions' and can therefore be subjected to more scrutiny (as opposed to trust)
          - the 'reason compounding the certainty of that possibility' is the interface structure associated with the insight 'more easily controlled variables (by agents with incentives to lie) being more subject to noise and other forms of falsehood' to generate other structures like 'a set of falsehoods where the truths are so rare they might as well be a random error' to identify a data set as part of a 'liar' or 'error/falsehood' cluster
          - deriving the 'reason compounding a certainty (the reason a statement could be true)' from the insight 'more easily controlled variables (by agents with incentives to lie) are likelier to contain falsehoods (where falsehoods are more efficient and accomplish the same or a similar goal)':
            - if a statement is true, it not only requires that it 'lacks relevant contradictions', but also requires an 'incentive to tell the truth' ('to share or communicate new info', 'to solve a specific problem', 'to contradict a falsehood', 'to draw attention to the truth', 'to make the truth useful for other people', 'to help others solve problems'), which is an 'opposite' structure of a structure in the insight ('incentives to lie'), if there are incentives to lie, otherwise there is no reason to say it
          - deriving the insight 'more easily controlled variables are more subject to falsehoods'
            - apply 'probability' to the 'requirement' concept applied to the 'input' structure ('variables', 'intents') of the 'function' structure
              - an agent that uses a function with total control is less likely to need that function, and can survive while faking that function

      - apply interface structures to problems to generate new solution automation workflows that involve a reduction of some solution metric (problem variable set, distance from solution, number of un/solved sub-problems as a ratio of total sub-problems, etc)
        - all of the solution automation workflows in problem_solution_diagrams.svg involve changes to the variables of problem/solution structures
          - change problem until its a solution (changes the problem state until its useful in some way)
          - solve different problem (change problem identity, like to the 'causal problem')
          - break problem into sub-problems (change problem scope/complexity)
          - connect problem/solution (change problem/solution position)
          - reduce problem (change problem variable set to a subset)
          - filter solutions (change problem space possibilities to a subset)
          - change existing solution until its more optimal (change suboptimal solution)
        - the interface structures (changes) applied to the variables of problem/solution structures need to fulfill definitions ('make sense, having no relevant contradictions')
          - for example: 'changing a suboptimal solution' is only useful when the change fulfills solution metrics more optimally than the previous state
          - so the 'change' applied would only qualify as an implementation of a solution automation workflow if it 'improves the suboptimal solution' (fulfills the definition of 'solving a problem')
        - sub-intents of each workflow, like 'find input info of the workflow', are components of the workflow implementation (interface query)
          - workflow: connect problem/solution (change problem/solution position)
            - sub-intents (alternative, overlapping, sequential sub-problems)
              - 'find input info of the workflow' sub-intent: find connective/interactive structures to use in connections
              - 'find structures to input to the connect function' sub-intent: find structures required to be connected
          - various workflows can be used to implement these sub-intents:
            - 'find input info of the workflow' sub-intent: find connective/interactive structures to use in connections
              - 'derive the structures that are adjacent inputs to the solution by applying solution requirements like solution metrics'
                - this implements the workflow 'derive structures in between problem/solution using input-output sequence'
            - 'find structures to input to the connect function' sub-intent: find structures required to be connected
              - this implements the workflow 'apply requirements to derive certain structures that can be connected with uncertainties (variables)', where the uncertainties here are the 'structures or methods to connect those structures which need to be connected'
              - the output of the previous sub-intent can be used as input to this workflow
              - the 'adjacent inputs of the solution (derived from solution requirements)' can be input to the 'connect' function
                - meaning the 'problem structures' should be connected to the 'solution-adjacent inputs'
        - these sub-intents of each workflow are each problem-solving intents, bc they all add useful information to use a solution automation workflow, even if the current workflow cant be completed (just the sub-intent is completed)

      - identify useful structures like 'alternate structures' that can be combined to create solution automation workflows which are not default components of solution automation workflows (solutions, problem-solving intents, etc)
        - example: the 'iteration' structure of a 'for loop' is the corresponding structure of 'try every possible solution, score each one, and compare scores' or 'try every possible solution & score each one, until one score is above the solution score threshold', as 'for loops' are often used to 'build a reduced list out of another list'
        - similarly, the 'function parameters' (inputs, values being changed) & 'function return values or value changes' (outputs) are corresponding structures of the 'find input-output sequences that connect problem/solution' workflow
        - the 'filter the solution space' workflow also corresponds to the 'iteration to reduce a set' structure represented by a for loop with a filter applied to a list
        - given that core logic structures are corresponding structures of core workflows, combining core logic structures as components of other workflows is a way to generate workflows

      - identify useful structures (like 'inputs') of solution automation workflows and identify methods to convert structures into those requirements, to select which workflow to apply when one is more optimal than other
        - example: the 'break problem into sub-problems' workflow has a requirement of 'isolatable change types', given the structural impact of the workflow which is 'isolating change types'
          - these change types can be sub-problems (reductions of the problem), which can take the form of:
            - 'solving the original problem, for a subset of the original problem variables'
            - 'solving the original problem, broken into a sequence/tree/network of sub-problems'
            - 'solving the problems causing the original problem which are "components" of the problem in that they are "inputs" of the problem'
          - similarly, the 'filter a solution space' workflow has a requirement of 'existing solutions to try' or 'existing possible combinations/changes (in the problem space) to try (which may or may not be solutions but are possibilities)'

      - identify useful structures which store info such as 'representative data (data set shape) of other info (data set)', where the stored info can be used as a proxy or substitute for the other info to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'reduce required computations'
        - example: knowing the 'general shape' of the data set is useful information to assess whether a directional change or parameter of a prediction function is likely to produce a correct prediction function, and may be more useful in some cases than the actual data point, as the 'general change types like change patterns and change rates and variable interactions' are included in the 'general shape' of the data set but are not included in individual data points, which are used as the input to most 'find a prediction function' solution-finding methods
          - the 'representative data' is also useful for other intents like 'generalizing a function', as 'specific data points' are likelier to be corrupted, mistaken, or influenced by other irrelevant factors than the 'general shape of the data set'

      - identify useful structures (like 'additional inputs', as in 'additional input data derived/inferred/imputed' or 'probable additional input data') for specific intents in a problem space like 'find a prediction function' that could fulfill solution metrics like 'accuracy'
        - example: if predicting whether a particularly high output (target y-value) exists (or is likely to exist) in a data set (for intents like 'augmenting data' and 'inferring new data' and 'imputing data (filling in missing data)')
          - first find the x-range of lowest/highest x-values, then select random subsets of the data set and find a function that describes each random subset
          - then find the maximum y-value of this function over the x-range, using a method such as 'find out if there are adjacent points to the target y-value in a pattern that would make it possible for the y-value to exist in the function (like "are there two points surrounding the peak of a curve, where the peak is the y-value" or "are there two points surrounding the y-value in opposite directions, at a change rate that is plausible for the function as it exists elsewhere in the function")' or "is it adjacent to known points in the function within an accuracy range"
          - apply this maximum y-value of the random subset function to check if the particularly high target y-value could be output by that function (do any known approximations/representations of the data set - or metadata of these approximations/representations like the 'maximum y-value of the approximation' - indicate this output is possible/probable)
          - repeat the steps starting from the 'selection of random points' until there are enough statistically significant functions that could output the y-value, up to a number of repetitions that is fewer steps than applying a standard method like a regression method
          - alternatively apply a filter like 'random points in a set of sub-ranges of the x-range' to evenly distribute the random points selected to make the random selections more meaningful in similarity to the actual probable prediction function
          - this applies info about the possible y-variable value, compares it to corresponding info about the representative data (maximum y-values of random subset functions) and filters out possible y-values based on a threshold selected to be a similarity identifier (the 'accuracy range' allowing a degree of adjacent points to be included in a function)
          - this method looks for a 'corresponding structure in a known structure' (maximum y-value of known representations) to compare a 'possible structure' (possible high target y-value) with
          - similarly, when applying a standard regression method, looking for a 'corresponding structure' ('most adjacent point') in a known structure ('function implied by calculations already done') to compare a 'possible structure' ('possible next or other y-value') with can fulfill intents like 'reduce computations required' (as given the lack of volatility in most functions, points can be connected by curves that match the change rates shown in the rest of the function, so given a 'most adjacent point of a probably correct function', the relevance in the form of the accuracy of a 'possible next point' can be assessed except where the change types like change rates of the function experience a phase shift or other change requiring that some other points' averages be computed as well (instead of applying inference rules to identify other points))
            - similarly, a 'random next point' can be chosen and corrected once compared with change types/rates of the probably correct function, which is likely to reduce computations as well
          - finding other data to include in a data set can increase the accuracy of a solution-finding method for the 'find a prediction function' problem, so is generally useful for fulfilling problem-solving intents like 'improve base solutions on some solution metric'

      - identify useful structures like 'overlapping structures in common' between useful structures like 'stored structures' which can be applied as inputs to functions like 'merge' to generate new possible useful structures
        - example: a 'generative filter' (such as an iteration of a set of possible solutions which applies 'differences' to filtered out solutions to generate more possible solutions to apply as future possible solutions in the iteration of possible solutions) can be derived by noting that 'apply differences to error structures to generate possible solutions' and 'filter possible solutions' have structures in common, that being 'errors in the set of possible solutions which are filtered out as not solutions' and 'known error structures as input to a change function to generate possible solutions', therefore identifying that 'generating possible new solutions from solutions determined to be not solutions in the set of possible solutions' is a useful structure is a matter of identifying this structure in common and the possible usefulness of this new structure (identifying new possible solutions not already in the set of possible solutions by applying differences to the possible solutions once theyre identified as errors), which makes use of the overlapping common structure to integrate/merge these structures to generate a possible new useful structure, which is useful in cases when the set of possible solutions is unlikely to be complete, such as when a function is applied to generate structures which are different from optimal solutions, such as 'maximally different possible solutions' or 'base solutions' as the set of possible solutions

      - identify useful structures by generating a set of possible useful structures (like "possible useful functions with an 'intent' but no logic built yet") and filtering them by metrics of usefulness like 'common components', 'alternate intents theyre useful for', 'what problem-solving intents they would fulfill or functions they would reduce requirements/computation for'
        - example: making a list of useful functions to build to fulfill intent likes 'finding errors' and 'fixing errors' (a function to 'identify useful structures like "root causes" or "common inputs" in error information', a function to 'identify solutions already tried which failed in error information', a function to 'identify possible/probable errors before they happen') would have the output of useful functions like a function 'that generates errors in a codebase/function', as this generative function can generate the inputs/outputs (like 'error information' and 'causes of errors') to other useful functions in the list and can fulfill the primary intents like 'finding/fixing errors' with just one function rather than several, or a function set that can be combined to generate the functions in the list (like 'get definition of solution/error' and 'check if a structure matches the definition like a solution/error'), which are useful bc they reduce the number of functions required, can generate other useful functions, can generate useful information for other functions like 'cause' info, fulfill multiple intents, and/or can be combined/chained to fulfill other intents
        - 'identifying a list of useful functions to build' can be a simple matter of 'identifying common work done which is not implemented in a function yet' (like 'tasks which are done manually'), and filtering this list can be as simple as 'identifying which functions have overlapping functionality, which functions have common component functions which might be more useful to build, which functions enable other functions, which functions fulfill useful metrics like "reduction of requirements of other functions"', rules which can be applied structurally to filter the set of possible useful functions to build
        - a 'useful structure-identification function' is an adjacent alternative to a 'solution-finding method', as the only structure required to convert it into a 'solution-finding method' would be applying adjacent changes to combine & otherwise connect the useful structures found until they fulfill solution requirements
        - this workflow involves a method of identifying 'useful filters of useful structures' (variables which can separate the set of possible useful structures) and 'generative methods of useful structures' (such as by applying workflows like 'derive solutions from solution requirements'), and applying these structures as opposing structures (like 'functionality' and 'requirements' are opposing structures) when generating and filtering possible structures like solutions to the problem of 'identify useful structures to apply in a specific problem or across problems'

      - identify structures which are alternates to other structures that fulfill useful intents like 'reducing storage requirements' or 'reusing existing structures' which are generally useful for problem-solving intents like 'reduce resources required to solve a problem'
        - example: 
          - 'specific information' (like 'examples') can be useful for intents like 'function implementations' (like storing input/output maps if theyre relatively static, or applying changes to these input/output maps based on input similarity, instead of implementing specific function logic) and 'filtering out reasons to use abstract variants like types' which are useful for other intents like 'identifying which structures to store (known constants) and which to generate dynamically (uncertainties/variables)'
          - 'reasons to use a structure (such as the required or probable outputs of using the structure) like a "specific" or "abstract" structure' can also identify when to use a specific structure vs. an abstract structure 
        - these structures ('reasons to use a structure', 'expected outputs of the structure', 'known intents fulfilled by a structure') are alternate structures which can be useful in intents like 'filtering what structures to use'
          - storing the 'reasons to use a structure' vs. storing the 'expected outputs of the structure' (a specific example of the 'reasons to use a structure') vs. storing 'known intents fulfilled by the structure' can provide optimization opportunities, if some of these structures are used more frequently across interface queries, functions, or solution automation workflows
          - other structures with similar functionality as these structures include:
            - 'requirements including the structure or its outputs'
            - 'known contexts/systems where the structure is useful or required'
            - 'structures that are useful for determining the probable output of a structure (like a function), when applied in a system where it hasnt been tested' (such as by finding any structures in the system that could neutralize or alter the steps or requirements of the function, which are capable of interacting with the function or its requirements in that way)
        - other relevant structures, like 'phase shifts where one structure stops being more useful than an alternate structure', are similarly useful for this workflow

      - identify interface structures based on 'interface structures (like change types, cause, etc) of interface structures', to fulfill useful intents like 'find interface structures that are probably found adjacent to each other' to fulfill intents like 'connect interface structures'
        - example: the structures nearest to an interface are likely to be composed of 'core structures' of that interface, are likely to be in the shape of 'overlapping pyramids' (describing multiple 'combinations of core structures' (bases) with different outputs (peaks)) than other shapes like a 'set of circles returning to the interface' or a 'tree with outputs pointing at the interface', where 'similar changes across these pyramids' are likely to represent 'phase shifts' and 'interaction levels' and 'system layers (of a system layer diagram)', and the changes farthest from the interface are likely to be 'outputs' of the other changes rather than 'adjacent changes resulting from core combinations of core structures', given how changes on an interface usually interact, such as in 'fractal patterns'
        - 'finding connected interface structures' is useful for many problem-solving intents, like 'find alternate interface structures (like alternate "definitions")', 'find cause of interface structures (like changes)', etc

      - identify useful structures that fulfill required intents like 'preserving an interface' which is required for a system to exist, interfaces being a core structure of systems, representing stable states of the system
        - example: a 'limiting structure' and a 'changing structure' are required 'opposite' structures, which are required to fulfill required 'preservation' intents like 'make sure change doesnt get out of control' in a system which would destroy the system, which is necessary if the system is to exist or be useful, and necessary while the system is still more useful/beneficial than costly
          - similarly, a 'change that is possible on an interface' (like a 'base line') is a 'change that doesnt destroy or destabilize the interface' (like a 'smaller line than the base line, applied in a direction other than that of the base line')

      - identify useful structures determining relevance, such as 'similar differences that make variables relevant' to supplement, replace, or implement known useful structures like 'interaction levels' to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'find relevant variables'
        - example: a predator's 'claws' and 'teeth' might be the most relevant variables to its prey, unless it also has a tail which can attack and reach the prey, which is relevant to the other variables by a 'similarity' in the 'possible values' of the 'position' variable, answering the question, 'which variables are relevant to the prey, when the prey is in position x' to identify 'variables that can have a "similarity" in position', thereby making these variables possibly relevant to each other ('teeth' and 'claws' and 'tail' could be relevant to each other by being 'interchangeable alternates' for the 'attack' function), so the question 'which variables are relevant to the prey, when the prey is in position x' can be converted to 'what variables can occupy the same position as each other, and the same position as the prey'
          - similarly, 'tools which can be used by some variable to "extend their range"' would also be relevant variables, as they change a 'previously irrelevant' variable for a position into a 'relevant' variable for that position by increasing the 'positions the variable can be relevant to', which is a target structure for identifying relevance of a variable
            - this can be used to derive relevant variables, by identifying 'variables which can make another variable relevant' (what types of change would interact to fulfill intents like 'extending distance reachable' which are relevant intents to variables like 'position' which are relevant for being under the control of the prey) and identifying 'whether those variables exist'
          - 'variables' can be determined to be relevant by a 'similarity' like this, which makes them 'interactive' (interactions such as 'coordinating', 'neutralizing', or 'overlapping') in some way, so that they can be 'combined', which is a core interaction function of 'variables', and this means that variables can be derived by applying 'similar differences' which allow finding other variables which are different enough to be classified as an isolatable variable but similar enough (in a similarity like 'possible positions') to be interactive (on the same 'interaction level' as another variable)
          - this is similar to how finding an orthogonal dimension can be found by applying a 'similar difference' to another dimension ('rotate the x axis 90 degrees to find the orthogonal dimension y'), which is not so different that it is equal to the original dimension (as 'rotate 360 degrees' would accomplish) or 'irrelevantly different' (as 'rotating 180 degrees' would accomplish) both of which would essentially generate the same line as the original x axis, and not 'irrelevantly different' in that the rotated line has an overlap in the 'change type' it describes, in describing horizontal as well as vertical change, and applies the x axis as a base for this change, which can be used to derive the new axis by applying core change types, or applying intents like 'find the changes required to create a useful difference, like describing different differences (vertical as opposed to horizontal) by identifying the changes described by the original structure (horizontal) and identifying changes not described by that structure and identifying a base (y axis) that could describe it', creating a useful difference in a line rotated to 90 degrees which can measure an 'isolatable (different change type) but interactive (similar interaction level)' change type (these changes are not so different that they cant interact, but are not so similar as to be interchangeable)

      - identify structures of relevance to find relevant structures for functions commonly used in solution automation workflows like primary functions like find/build/derive/apply to reduce the computations run by these functions, and therefore reduce steps to implement workflows
        - example: the 'apply' function applies changes in the form of a structure to another structure, in which the 'structure being applied' has to match the inputs of the 'structure its applied to', otherwise the structure being applied is not relevant to the structure being applied to, for example, applying a 'collision function' to 'blocks' is only relevant if there are 'multiple structures like "blocks" which can be collided' and if the 'blocks dont have an overriding function which prevents collisions like magnetic forces', meaning 'does the collision function have its inputs (blocks to collide, no collision-prevention structures) fulfilled'
          - so checking for '"inputs" which can make a structure useful to apply' is a filter of 'structures which can be applied to other structures'
          - similarly, with the 'find' function, only 'structures which can be found (structures which are measurable, structural, stable, stored, unique/determinable/identifiable compared to other structures)' can be found, so only these structures are relevant to the 'find' function
          - similarly, 'structures that can be connected' are relevant to the 'derive' function, and 'structures which can be combined' are relevant to the build function (as well as any structures which can make other structures findable, derivable, buildable, and applicable, making these structures relevant to these functions)
        - this workflow applies a definition of relevance to find structures that are useful (in the sense of being usable and therefore relevant) to the primary interaction functions, to filter out structures which are irrelevant when using these functions
        - this means 'structures which are findable' are a reduction of the solution space when applying the 'find' function
        - similarly, 'reduction structures' (such as 'any attribute which can differentiate a subset from another subset' applied to the 'solution space' of 'possible solutions'), are another useful structure to the 'find' function, given its definition
          - these reduction structures can be particularly useful when designing a filter sequence/tree/network that can optimize a query based on relevant 'find' intents
          - for example, identifying 'differentiating attributes (variables) of a solution space' can identify which 'differentiating attributes' should be applied as filters to 'maximize coverage of the solution space', to 'filter a subset of the solution space', to 'increase the chance of finding multiple alternative solutions or a unique solution', and other intents related to 'find', like 'filter', 'identify', 'differentiate', etc
        - identifying 'variables that can be controlled' is another example of variables which can be filtered (focused on) to identifying 'possible variables of a solution', as 'variables which can be controlled' are irrelevant

      - identify useful structures like 'sufficient similarity' to find structures which can be used to fulfill common intents like 'find alternates of a structure' which are useful for problem-solving intents like 'find alternate solutions'
        - example: applying code validation rules like the following can be used to correct logic, given the general or common applicability of such rules
          - 'if an input variable is tested for and not found to be initialized, and is assigned a value if this condition applies, apply the output of that assignment as a filter of the input value, if the input is initialized'
          - example of this code validation rule:
            - if the 'interfaces' input variable has a value, apply the primary interfaces found with the find('list', 'interface') function call which returns all defined interfaces, as a filter of valid values of the interfaces input variable
        - this code validation rule is not always true, but is generally or commonly useful
        - finding 'invariant structures' such as 'rules which are always true, in all possible cases or case types' which can be used to derive definitions, as structures of certainty such as structures which dont change
          - similarly 'rules which are generally or commonly true' can be used to find 'probable structures of certainty'
        - given that 'structures which dont change' can be used to find structures like 'definitions' given their common relation to 'certainty' structures, structures which are sufficiently similar can be used to identify/derive/substitute each other

      - identify the structures that can fix the causes of a problem, applying insights about problem causes such as that 'problems or problem causes are usually useful in some way to some entity if they exist enough to be noticed, or they wouldnt exist'
        - example: if a problem exists, its either beneficial to some entity with the ability to use the problem to its advantage or create the problem, or its not a big enough problem for enough entities to trigger the structures (like "priority increase to highest priority") that would be necessary to fix it
        - so finding structures like 'functions that find alternative ways to benefit those entities than the problem' would be useful in addressing the 'causes' of the problem (the 'benefit to some entity', the 'problematic attributes of that entity like "parasitic/predatorial strategies to benefit from causing problems"', or the 'lack of solution-triggering structures')
          - the root causes of these causes includes:
            - 'inability of all entities to understand & prioritize meaning (meaning in the form of the impact on the host, as if a pathogen kills the host, its also hurting itself, but it cant detect that bc it cant grasp context, time, emergent conclusion like "host death" of structures such as "parasitic patterns applied at scale which dont encounter reducing/opposing structures like limits", and other structures that could make it aware of the impact of its structures on other structures)'
            - such a solution would apply the 'distribute solution-finding methods and priorities to all structures, such as functions/objects (like pathogens relying on a host to survive), rather than limiting problem-solving capacity to some structures (like immune cells)', which would possibly take a form such as 'distributing host immune markers to all cells and creating costs to all cells based on those markers, so the pathogens get negative feedback for parasitic strategies, rather than short-term positive feedback leading them to repeat that strategy until the host dies' or 'creating short-term feedback that represents long-term feedback for pathogens or mutations capable of killing the host, if they can only use short-term feedback and dont have the resources like "storage" or functions like "computation" to make long-term feedback useful', or 'find all specific strategies (or strategy inputs/states/components) used by cells that eventually lead to host death and prevent cells from using them'
        - similarly the problem causes may be useful bc they cause the problem, meaning the problem is 'caused by some function' and 'not solving the caused problem makes that function useful to some entity by reducing the work involved in that function', so functionality to 'minimize resources needed' would help that entity avoid creating such a function, so 'distributing this functionality to all entities' would be a useful structure to fix the problem causes, one of which is the 'inability to minimize resources needed'

      - identify structures like 'high variation causative structures' that are useful in changing relevant variables like solutions/errors, as in 'causing a solution to be an error structure' or 'causing an error to become a solution structure', which are useful variables for many problem-solving intents like 'filter solution space' or 'change existing solution to improve a solution metric', as the 'opposite of a solution' is an important structure to avoid, and knowing the cause of an 'opposite' is useful in avoiding that
        - example: identify 'high-variation causing structures' like 'reasons that completely change the meaning of a structure (such as how "testing for a reaction" can completely change the meaning of a particular "statement")' or 'cycles (such as circular or wave functions) are a structure which completely change the resolvability of an ambiguity and change what info is required to resolve it, like adjacent point context of the original point to find the output value for', as 'high variation causing structures' are likely to be useful in identifying 'opposite' structures which can change a solution into an error
        - this workflow involves identifying useful structures to avoid to fulfill problem-solving intents, and the structures that can make that identification trivial

      - identify useful structures like 'contradictions of insights' that can identify useful structures like 'relevant changes to apply to existing solution-finding methods' in a particular problem format like 'find a prediction function' to 'filter the solution space' of 'possible solutions' to the problem of 'find changes to apply to solution structures' in the workflow 'improve an existing solution by applying changes to it'
        - example: a 'regression' or 'machine-learning' method might find no correlation between two sets of variables (like the 'number of products purchased in one region' and the 'environment impact in another region') but as 'all variables are related', this would be a false result, so a robust solution method would have a mechanism to find correlations given this insight that 'all variables are related', allowing for distant causation or different interaction levels than those in the original data set like 'agent decisions', 'time', 'markets' and 'market manipulation', which can be produced by applying interface structures rather than simple 'combinations of input variables', thereby applying inferred or general or common variables (like 'variable patterns'), rather than just the input variables and just the 'combine' operation
        - just by applying this one insight, interface structures can be inferred, so identifying a 'contradiction of the insight' present in specific problem-format solution-finding methods like regression & machine-learning methods is particularly useful
        - an adjacent method to derive interface structures is useful on its own, but is also useful for deriving new useful structures adjacently
        - similarly other insights like 'identifying connections of an isolated variable set is rarely useful without context' is another insight that can adjacently derive interface structures (like the 'cause' of the variables and the 'intent' of identifying the connection between isolated variables, as in 'to correct lack of info' or 'to find specific info like causal variables' or to 'filter out non-causal variables')
        - if the insights are in fact insights, they should be confirmed or reflected in a good solution that reflects the truth, rather than contradicted by that solution
        - similarly, a statistical or machine-learning solution-finding method might identify a 'correlation' between the 'green skin' and 'aliens' but a solution-finding method using interface structures would identify a 'combination of errors' that would cause a 'false similarity', such as 'filtering out or under-prioritizing examples of failures (where a similarity is not significant or related or accurate)' and 'over-prioritizing simple structures like structural similarities (like similar colors or shapes)', leading to 'agent' interface structures like 'conspiracies' ('systems created by lack of information in the form of an over-prioritization, that seem based on truth until a counterexample is found to identify the missing information resulting from the priority'), since interface structures apply 'cause' to find the cause of a structure like a 'similarity' (causes like errors of over-prioritization, missing information, flexibility resulting in unenforced truth adherence, tendency to over-simplify, such as by simplistically classifying rare variable values like 'green' as meaningfully similar to other rare variable values like 'foreign' despite no reason to associate these)

      - identify the reason ('equivalence' in inputs/outputs) for the usefulness of a structure (like commonly useful structures such as 'simple' and 'complex' structures) and apply it to find useful structures like 'simple/complex set that have equal inputs/outputs', given that 'equivalences' are generally useful for problem-solving intents like 'connect problem/solution' or 'find a function implementing an intent'
        - example: identify that structures like sets of 'simple and complex structures with the same inputs/outputs' can fulfill useful intents like 'find implementation/fulfillment structures of an intent', as a simpler structure like an 'intent' is likely to be fulfilled by a more complex structure like a 'function fulfilling that intent' if the inputs/outputs of the two structures are equivalent, which makes one structure useful to the other for various intents ('find a simplified representation of the function (such as the intent)', and 'find a function that fulfills the intent')
        - these structures are useful for other intents, like 'find the variables to apply that convert a simple structure (like the intent) into an equivalent complex structure (like the implementing function)' which is useful for problem-solving intents like 'find a function that implements an intent'

      - identify useful structures such as 'solution component filters' that are useful for common intents like 'filter' to apply in workflows that use those intents like 'filter the solution space'
        - example: a function necessarily changes some inputs, so anything that doesnt change an input can be ruled out as a possible solution function to the 'find a prediction function' problem, and any 'combination of changes' can be included in the set of possible solutions to the 'find functions' problem
        - this workflow involves identifying useful structures by applying common core intnets like 'filter' to common problem/solution structures like 'solution components'

      - identify useful structures like 'contradiction example input/output mappings' that fulfill useful intents like 'find useful structures like "change filters"' which are useful to many problem-solving intents, like 'improve a solution by applying changes to a function'
        - example: storing a 'input/output mapping' of 'contradiction examples' as metadata to store with a 'function definition' is a useful structure to store with a function bc it provides a target for improvements to the function which is useful for filtering future changes to the function (based on a solution metric of whether they improve handling of those contradiction examples), as well as taking the place of logic that would be required to handle those specific counterexamples

      - identify useful structures like connections between problems and structures connected to solutions (like functions, each function being a solution to a problem)
        - example: solving 'which problems create which functions' (which problem maintains the need for a function or leads to the creation of that function) as a way of determining alternate implementation methods of functions (applying problems as a function-generating structure, if the problem is adjacent enough to the function with existing resources that it can be converted into the function by default or otherwise adjacently)
        - this workflow involves applying the 'inputs' of solutions (including 'problems') as an 'input' to solve problems like 'find a function' which may be applied in interface queries, answering the question 'what problem would develop the function required to solve a problem like "find/build/derive a function"'

      - identify useful structures like 'probability' and 'reason for probability' that are useful in identifying useful structures like 'certainty structures' which are useful for many intents like 'identifying truth structures like insights', 'testing if a structure is true/certain', and 'implementing functions that are useful in that they reflect reality' which are usable in many problem-solving intents like 'filter the solution space'
        - example: certainty structures like constants & limits are relatively uncommon compared to uncertainty structures like variables, bc certainty structures are useful for changing the changes allowed by variables and act like a controlling structure on variables, which is useful when a problem occurs bc of the variables, and given the corrective power of certainty structures on variables, this further indicates that fewer certainty structures are required compared to variables (to explore useful differences to new problems), as a problem is only likely to result from an uncertainty structure that doesnt reflect truth and is only likely to be changed by a certainty structure correcting that incorrect uncertainty structure so it better reflects truth, this dichotomy serving as a useful opposite structure to balance problems/solutions between, as solutions must have some variation (uncertainty) to allow for adaptation to different contexts and different new problems, but must have some degree of certainty (constants, limits) in their reflection of the truth
        - the reason for the 'lower probability' of the truth structure is the 'lower requirement for truth structures to manage uncertainty structures', the indication that 'if a truth structure is found, its likely bc a problem (a problematic difference from reality) had occurred which the truth structure corrects', and the 'higher usefulness of uncertainty structures like variables in many intents except for intents like "correcting an incorrect structure generated by an uncertainty"'
        - a variant of this workflow is to 'apply changes to certainty structures' (like insights, patterns, or known solutions) to create useful differences like improvements to suboptimal known solutions, changes that stay within the limits created by those certainty structures (not so different that the differences violate the truth), where certainty structures are not sufficient to solve a problem, so uncertainty structures like variables/differences can increase the usefulness of a solution, since 'previous truths' act like a base for 'new truths' so applying changes to 'previous or knwon truths' can produce 'new/unknown truths', which applies this as an insight generating this solution automation workflow, which applies truth structures as an interface around which uncertainty structures like changes vacillate before resolving into truth structures (the 'interface network' being a structure that requires the fewest differences in order to become useful and reflective of reality while maintaining its ability to change)

      - identify useful structures like 'opposites' that are useful for multiple core intents like 'find differences' and 'apply difference' and 'filter' which are adjacently useful to problem-solving intents like 'filter solution space', when applied to specific structures like 'requirements' to identify other specific structures like 'the set of (interchangeable alternates and requirements)' which are useful in specific contexts like 'where requirements are suboptimal' such as by 'applying variables to create interchangeable alternates of the requirements' to solve the problem of 'removing suboptimal requirements' or 'apply changes to requirements to make them different from requirements (optional)'
        - example: identify structures like 'interchangeable alternates' as an 'opposite structure' to structures that can be suboptimal like 'requirements'
        - a related workflow involves identifying problems where a particular solution automation workflow would be more useful to correct the problem (such as how this workflow is particularly useful when 'variability in solution requirements would be useful', or when a 'requirement is a problem cause') and applying changes to change the problem into that problem (changing the original problem into a problem of 'invalidating, removing, or changing requirements'), by applying differences to the solution automation workflow to find problems that would benefit from that workflows' connection structures
          - example: apply differences to the 'identify "opposites" as useful for intents like "find differences" to identify other useful structures like "interchangeable alternates" as useful for creating other useful structures like the "set of interchange alternates and requirements"' workflow in order to find the problems (like 'removing suboptimal requirements') where the workflow is particularly useful
          - "identifying interchangeable alternates" would help with the problem of 'removing requirements'
          - applying 'changes' to "identifying interchangeable alternates" would result in identifying 'opposite' structures of those structures ('requirements'), thereby identifying any problems that involve 'problematic requirements' as a useful workflow to solve that problem
          - keeping 'example' structures in a solution automation workflow definition is useful in 'reducing computations' to 'find relevant structures to that workflow', which is useful for intents like 'find similar/different workflows' or 'find interactive/connective structures with a workflow like a problem where the workflow is particularly useful'

      - identify structures like "connections between solution metrics (like 'fairness') and structures that can be identified with existing functions (like 'certainty')" as a 'reason' to apply the 'existing (certainty) structures' to fulfill the 'solution metrics' (fairness), as opposed to other structures, to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'find structures that fulfill solution netrics' and 'filter the solution space (of structures that fulfill solution metrics)'
        - example: identify structures (like more structures such as variables or structure-generating structures like questions) that capture info better than simpler structures (like fewer structures), such as how the 'question of whether an individual is good or evil' is optimized by asking additional questions like 'what is the connection of their abilities/functions and their requirements (inputs and required outputs)' and 'what is the impact of their decisions (weighing the importance of outputs (as interactive with other structures) as being similarly important as their inputs, at various scales like global/local and other variables like time (the impact on their future decisions) and examples (the common impact on future decisions by other recipients of that feedback)' and 'are their decisions common (invalidating the focus on an individual as opposed to a group)' and 'are their decisions avoidable' and 'what is the impact of feedback on their decisions', questions which apply 'additional' interface structures (which act like connection structures and certainty structures) and apply 'fairness' as a 'solution metric like accuracy' of a solution (solving the problem of 'finding solutions reflecting truth' as a way of identifying the solution metric for identified alternate question sets of 'does the question generate fairness')
        - this workflow involves identifying better formats (like a 'minimized' variable set or 'accurate' variable set) for structures (like a variable set) that fulfill an intent more optimally despite impact on other solution metrics of problem-solving intents like 'minimizing storage requirements', bc these better formats apply additional interface structures and therefore fulfill the problem-solving intent of 'improving a solution (by solution metrics like completeness, accuracy, robustness)', and identifying how to convert to those formats, such as by applying "core interface structures like 'input/output'" to "other interface structures like interaction level structures (like 'decisions' on the 'agent' interaction level)" to identify structures of meaning 'what is the impact of their decisions'
        - a variant of this workflow would identify 'structures (like 'additional') of interface structures' that improve solutions, such as how a solution involving additional connected interface structures is likelier to be robust, correct, and relevant/useful/meaningful

      - identify structures that can fulfill problem-solving intents like 'filter error structures' when fulfilling useful structures like other problem-solving intents such as 'find and remove error structures'
        - example: identify that 'selfishness' is a useful structure bc of the 'reason' that its a 'high variation structure', and identify that 'high variation structures' are unlikely to be an 'error structure' that should be 'removed' (as opposed to 'changed') when applying the 'find error structures like error causes and remove them' problem-solving intent
        - for example, the 'selfishness' structure is not 'required' to be applied (its optional, which adds a variable), and it doesnt have to be applied in the same way (like only to protect the individual, as opposed to protecting groups they belong to, which adds another variable), so when selfishness is suboptimal (like defending a group member just bc of membership), it can be avoided, and when its optimal (like in deadly contexts), it can be prioritized
        - the high number of variables in how selfishness is applied indicate its an important structure and also that its unlikely to be an error structure, given its variable usefulness (rather than 'absolute uselessness')
        - this workflow involves identifying useful structures such as 'high variation structures' which can 'filter the solution space' when applying problem-solving intents like 'find & remove error structures', as 'structures too important to remove' are a useful structure to 'filter the solution space (of structures to remove)', as 'required tasks' like 'organizing resource allocation' and 'sustaining life' would be almost impossible with existing brain functions if people didnt organize their attention using 'selfish' priorities like 'finding resources fulfilling their own basic requirements'

      - identify useful structures like 'high information reduction structures' (such as the 'similarity attribute') that fulfill common useful intents (like 'reduce calculations required', 'summarize', 'identify alternatives/equivalents') in a problem space, as these structures are likely to be useful for other intents, some of which may be problem-solving intents ('reduce calculations required')
        - example: a program could only store the 'similarity' of content rather than searching all the attributes of the content or the content itself, and use that similarity to show recommended alternatives, rather than requiring a custom complex algorithm to find what users are likely to view next, applying the insight that users are likely to be interested in similar content to that they intentionally viewed, rather than deriving their intent in a complex algorithm, as some problems can be reduced to fewer attributes, and these fewer attributes can be useful for fulfilling intents like 'privacy' or 'reducing memory use' or 'reducing computations required'
        - this workflow involves finding structures (like an 'attribute' such as 'similarity') that encapsulate a high amount of information (such as whether information is related to other information, to fulfill intents like "identify whether the information is connected, alternative, similar, coincidentally similar, or some other intent that can use 'similarity information' as an input") without losing usefulness for other intents such as semi-derivability of that information
          - if information is similar to other information, it can likely be derived to some degree (or the set of possible information can at least be filtered) by applying the difference represented by the similarity to the other information, given the similarity definition
          - the information is required to be slightly different, otherwise there is no 'reason' that could trigger a 'view decision' (such as 'viewing new content (new meaning slightly different)')
        - related workflow: 
          - a variant of this workflow involves identifying structures (like the 'similarity attribute') that can be simultaneously useful for commonly useful intents like 'deriving a degree of info' and 'identifying similar info' and 'preserving privacy' which are likely to be required simultaneously
          - a variant of this workflow involves identifying the insight ('find similar information to show users bc its likelier to be something they want to view if its similar enough to what they already indicated they like, through structures of intent that are also structures of certainty') associated with the useful structure (the 'similarity attribute') that can be used to identify the useful structures, which would involve identifying the 'reason' ('similarity to content that was defined to be liked') of the target structure (the 'view decision'), as the user supplies a 'certainty structure' and a 'structure of intent' in their 'view decisions' (the solution metric being optimized), and the 'reason' for the 'view decision' (they wanted to view it, liked it, it was relevant/interesting, they liked the specific information in the content, etc) can be applied as an 'input' to trigger additional 'view decisions', an algorithm that prioritizes the 'view decisions' as trusted information indicating what they want to view, and prioritizing the 'specific information in the content' as the structure that the users are aiming to get (rather than 'structures of lack of intent' like clicking accidentally, or because it was the top search result or otherwise available/adjacent), an algorithm that could apply the 'apply changes to a base solution to find other solutions' workflow to 'identify the insight that similar content might also trigger a view decision'

      - identify useful structures (like 'attribute count') that are useful when a particular interface query is run (like 'applying the probability-structure interface') to fulfill a particular problem-solving intent (like 'filter solution space') to solve a problem (like 'implement a function such as identify/find structures')
        - example: an ambiguity is likelier to be a 'core structure' (with fewer attributes) bc of the improbability of finding 'ambiguous alternatives with a high number of attributes' or a 'high number of missing attributes' leading to the ambiguity, which applies the 'probability-structure' interface to solve the problem of 'filter the solution space' of possible solutions to the problem of 'identifying/finding structures' (find 'ambiguities' by finding 'core structures'), like how saying "we're (verb)-ing" could be interpreted as a decision of a group or a description in a conversation
        - solution success cause: this is useful bc of the counterintuitive nature of the connection between 'ambiguity' and 'core structures' (as in, its not specified by any definition route of ambiguity or core and can be added as an alternative definition route when more certain definition routes fail)
        - generalization: this workflow can be abstracted to find the specific intents/problems and interface queries that would produce a useful structure like a 'counterintuitive connection', such as identifying the probability-structure interface as being usable to connect an 'ambiguity' and a 'core' structure, given their similarity in an attribute metadata attribute (attribute count) which is a structure of 'probability', so identifying the probability interface as useful amounts to the operation of 'identifying the reason for common structures between two structures to connect' (probability being a reason for commonness) and 'applying that reason for commonness as a method of connecting the structures' (connecting them in the sense of finding relevant similarities, relevant to the task of 'identifying alternate/connected structures of a structure, as a way of identifying that structure')

      - structures like 'functions applied' are useful to identify useful uncertainty structures like 'assumptions/predictions about structures like the usefulness, resources, requirements of those functions', 'assumptions/predictions' which may or may not be certain or otherwise useful insights that can be generalized or applied to find other useful structures, insights which are useful to derive
        - example: if an agent calls a function, the agent assumes and predicts that the 'outputs will be useful for its intents'
          - the 'reason the outputs are useful for their intents' may not be clear but are likely derivable and likely to be useful to derive
          - these are similarly useful structures as 'implications' of 'using a function', as 'structures of probability' (as opposed to certainty) adjacent to the function (there is a probable reason to find the outputs useful, there is a probable reason that is considered useful, there is a probable resource making that useful) which are useful in finding 'connecting structures' to connect the function with other structures like other useful functions fulfilling those predictions, given that if it exists, its likely to fulfill its predictions better than average

      - identify alternate routes to fulfill intents like 'identify useful structures' that are likely to already exist (like problem structures are likely to be already known)
        - example: identifying 'problem/suboptimality' structures is a way of identifying 'functions & inputs that dont exist yet' and 'differences not handled by existing functions, which are suboptimal for some useful intents given that these problems have been identified as a problem for some agent', where 'functions that dont exist yet' are a useful structure to determine adjacent structures like opposite structures, such as 'functions that do exist or are known', applying the insight that 'if a structure (like a problem) exists and has not been reduced (solved), the functions to reduce it (solution functions, solution-finding functions) are less likely to already be known or applied to solve it, if there is a reason to reduce it (the structure is a problem)' which indicates that this structure (a problem) can be used to determine which 'reduction functions' (solution functions) exist

      - identify useful structures like 'connecting structures' of 'problem/solution structures' and 'causal sequences' which are useful in intents like 'finding alternate connections between problem/solution structures' (finding new solution automation workflows)
        - example: the 'cause' of a 'new solution-finding method' might be identifiable at any point in its causal sequence (a 'suboptimality/error is identifiable (measurable) & identified', a 'solution is required', 'solution is possible', a 'solution is tested', a 'solution automation workflow (like 'applying all known solutions until one works') is applied and didnt fix it' a 'solution is identified as an improvement'), but only some structures in that sequence are useful as identifiers of a 'new, more optimal solution' ('inputs', 'requirements', 'reasons to find a new solution, such as a suboptimality/error'), as other structures in the sequence are irrelevant (the 'requirement' of a solution is irrelevant if it is 'impossible' to be solved so 'possibility' filters would have to be applied first in a sequential workflow, and the 'identifiability of a suboptimality' doesnt cause the solution, and none of these structures cause the specific solution structures applied in the optimal solution, unless there is only one solution, making those structures 'required constants')
        - if a workflow like 'trial & error applied to known solutions' is applied and found to not find a solution, that is a cause of applying functions to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'find new workflows', and is a cause of identifying the problem, but is not a direct cause of the solution

      - find useful structures like functions to apply to useful structures to find other useful structures
        - example: an abstract variant of a 'dichotomy' (with the requirement of a 'count' attribute value to be a constant value) is an 'exclusivity', which is useful for intents like 'find structures that dont co-occur' (like an 'impossibility' and a 'possibility' being connected as 'equivalents' of the same structure, these connections not occurring in any system that follows rules (a logical system, a real system, etc)
          - 'find structures that dont co-occur' is useful for other useful intents like 'selecting between alternates' and 'find opposite/different structures' which are useful for intents like 'differentiate/connect structures' and 'filter structures'
        - 'mutual exclusivities' are a 'core structure' related to other core structures like 'differences'
        - a 'falsehood' combined with the 'exclusivity' (a 'false dichotomy') is a useful structure in that it applies a core error structure 'false' to a core structure 'exclusivity' of core problem structures like 'difference', identifying a 'specific example of the error structure' from applying this combination function (thereby applying a 'false' filter to the set of abstract exclusivity structures to identify the specific structures that are 'error structures')
        - 'abstraction to find alternate examples' and 'combination with other useful structures like error structures to find specific error structures' are the useful functions to apply to the useful structure of a 'dichotomy' to find other useful structures to fulfill other useful intents

      - find structures that are useful in other problem-solving intents like 'finding other useful structures'
        - example: find 'new examples' of a structure like a 'type', since new examples are likely to enable adjacently identifying other useful structures like the 'route to find the useful structure', such as by connecting the 'system context' to the 'new example', which is likely to be a 'new route to useful structures' (like the example structure) if the example is genuinely new, and since there's likely to be a 'reason' for the 'difference' in the new example if its an actual unique example, a reason such as a 'new interface structure' causing the newly different example (if the difference is on the right interaction level and not just any difference in any attribute), and as differences in examples of the same structure are an important signal since 'examples of the same structure' are likely to have multiple similarities, probably more similarities than differences
          - 'finding attributes that connect very different structures' is a useful structure to 'find more adjacent routes connecting structures' (like how finding the opposite of a structure like a 'counterexample of a statement' or the limits of a structure can be more adjacent than finding the original structure) and 'find new differences to apply to create different structures' (like 'like creating maximally different alternate solutions to filter the solution space or the solution space of base solutions to change')
        - 'finding connections to useful structures' is a useful intent to make 'new examples' useful structures
        - 'finding a new example of a useful structure' is likely to enable adjacentlying identifying a new reason for the structure being useful, which is useful to apply to 'find new useful structures' or 'find alternate useful structures'

      - find structures that are useful for problem-solving intents like 'filter solution space' as useful structures like 'filters' applied to fulfill the problem-solving intent of 'find useful structures'
        - example: the 'reason for the irrelevance' of a 'structural similarity' is particularly useful to fulfill core interaction functions like 'filter' or 'differentiate' between relevant & irrelevant structural similarities, which are difficult but useful to identify/filter/differentiate, as 'structural similarities' are very useful structures when relevant
          - the 'reason for the relevance/irrelevance' of a 'structural similarity' may just be that the structure found to be similar to another structure is just a 'common structure' or a 'core structure', rather than its similarity to the other structure being similar for a relevant reason, like a similarity in the reasons why the structure was caused (like to 'apply it for the same intents')
          - the 'similarities in cause (reason) of the structure' and the 'similarities in intent of the structure' are therefore better structures to check for filtering structures that are relevant, as opposed to just applying 'structural similarities' on their own
          - the reason why 'causal similarities' and 'intent similarities' are useful to find relevant structures that are similar (as opposed to irrelevant structures that are similar) is that the cause/intent structures are likelier to be aligning with the reason for identifying/finding that structure in the first place (structural similarities arent typically sought to 'find common structures', theyre typically sought to 'find alternate structures to fulfill a particular purpose' or 'find all the examples of a structure'), therefore there is a (useful) 'structural similarity' between intent/cause of 'structural similarities' and the intent/cause of 'finding structural similarities' (which include intents like 'find all the examples of a structure')
          - in the reverse direction of derivation, 'structural similarities' can be a useful structure to fulfill intents like 'find common structures' or 'find core structures', as common structures are likely to be in a set of similar structures, and common structures are likely to be core structures
            - this fulfills the useful intent of 'find the context where a structure would be useful' to enable fulfilling other intents like 'check for that context to find useful structures to apply in an input context'
          - 'cause/intent' are therefore useful as a filter of 'structural similarities'
            - another reason a structure might be found to be similar is the structure is 'optimal' in some way, such as that its useful for some intent like 'find stable structures', so the structure is likely to be repeated as its optimal for some intent which means it may be useful for other intents or that intent (and the associated optimal structure fulfilling it) may be required elsewhere
            - the 'repetition' attribute is a useful 'connecting structure' of related structures like 'similarity' and 'commonness' as a 'cause' or 'output' of both structures, which makes it useful for intents like 'connecting/differentiating structures' which are useful for problem-solving intents like 'connect problem/solution' and 'filter solution space', which enables intents like 'identify useful reasons why a structure would have attributes' like 'similar but not common' (its a new optimization that hasnt been deployed elsewhere yet), 'similar and common' (its repeated often), etc, which is useful to differentiate the 'related and similar but unique' structures and differentiate when one structure can be used to identify the other or as a proxy for the other (when commonness is relevant vs. when its not)
            - 'related and similar but unique' structures are useful for many intents like 'approximate', 'substitute', etc, but should be filtered by relevance (the 'reason for the similarity is the same', or the 'input/output connections are the same' (inputs/outputs being a core useful structure))
          - adding a similarity of a 'similar system' in which the structures both develop is another structure indicating the relevance of the 'structural similarity', acting as a 'cause of relevance' which is a useful structure to find/evaluate in place of finding/evaluating relevance to fulfill intents like 'find useful structures'
          - this emphasizes the usefulness of structures like the 'count of similarities (like cause, intent, and structure) between structures' which fulfill the useful intent of 'increasing the probability of a structure being useful' which is useful for 'finding useful structures', as the more similarities in interface structures of a structure there are, the likelier that structure is to be useful, as on its own, one similarity may not be enough for usefulness
            - the more interface structures that two structures have in common, the likelier it is that they have the same meaning and related structures of meaning like usefulness
          - having a cause/intent in one position of a system means its likely there are other causes/intents that are similar to that cause/intent bc there is no 'limiting rule enforcing uniqueness of structures in a system' and 'repetition of structures in a system is a common attribute of system structures', so 'identifying if the structures both exist in the same system' is another useful intent to fulfill in finding out whether a 'structural similarity' is relevant to intents like 'find all examples of a structure'
            - 'having the same cause/intent' means that those causes/intents exist and are likely to be repeated (occur elsewhere), and the causes/intents are likely to have the same output when found elsewhere

      - identify & store the interface structures associated with interaction levels that make those structures more useful for useful structures like 'dichotomies' (like by fulfilling 'required' or 'otherwise useful' intents) in fulfilling a problem-solving intent like 'fulfilling as many problem-solving intents as possible'
        - example: the 'attribute interaction level' would have identifying differences like the 'solution metric value (such as the accuracy) of a particular solution function'
          - the 'adjacent structure interaction level' would have identifying differences like 'similarity of sub-function or function component sets with solution functions'
          - these interaction levels are optimal in both different & overlapping contexts, for both different & overlapping intents
          - different operations can be fulfilled more adjacently on different interaction levels, like:
            - how components on 'adjacent structure interaction levels' (such as 'function components' or 'incomplete functions' or 'sub-functions' or 'input functions') can be more adjacently converted to a solution function with fewer steps than other formats
            - how components on 'attribute interaction levels' can be more adjacently abstracted, as they already depend on a particular attribute, so abstracting the attribute or removing components of the attribute's interaction with specific structures or specific problem/solution structures (removing the 'solution function' specification to allow connecting the attribute to other functions like 'solution-finding functions') is an adjacent operation on that interaction level
          - 'finding a solution function with an accuracy level' may be more useful than 'finding a solution function composed of known incomplete solution functions', given the associated interface structures of these interaction levels (the contexts, intents, & functions more easily fulfilled with those structures) and the 'info requirements', 'change requirements', 'success probability', 'general usefulness across common problem-solving intents' and other useful metrics of these interface structures & interaction levels
          - this applies the 'functionality/resources vs requirements' dichotomy to find useful structures for problem-solving intents like 'fulfill solution requirements', like 'functions fulfilled by applying an interaction level' (a mix of interaction levels & other interface structures)
          - this identifies a new useful function structure as 'incomplete functions' (useful for having a common error type built-in to a solution-finding function, that is resolvable with derivation methods like 'applying patterns', to fulfill useful problem-solving intents like 'apply solution to real information which is likely to have common error types, to "connect erroneous inputs to solution outputs" as well as "connecting correct inputs to solution outputs"', applying the insight that 'errors are probable in inputs' to fulfill the problem-solving intent of 'find a solution-finding function that handles common or otherwise predictable error types')
          - this identifies another new useful structure of 'different and overlapping structures (like functions/attributes)' as useful for finding commonalities, similarities & differences
        - differentiation: this workflow applies an abstraction ('dichotomy') to the core problem structure of 'differences' and finds interface structures that can find/build/derive problem-solving structures to resolve that problem structure, to fulfill the problem-solving intent of 'resolve problematic differences' (a variant of 'connect problem/solution'), as 'different and overlapping functionality' is a useful structure for fulfilling 'difference resolution structures' to fulfill 'requirements of a solution', thereby connecting the 'dichotomy of functionality/requirements' with 'interface structures that can adjacently fulfill its opposite structures (to resolve the difference between functionality & requirements)'
          - this workflow connects interface structures on multiple interaction levels (the problem/solution interface, the structure interface, the difference interface), thereby making it likelier to be useful by default
          - a variant of this workflow would 'find structures that can also connect structures on these interfaces' as inherently useful structures to fulfill problem-solving intents
