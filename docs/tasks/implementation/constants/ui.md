- ui

  - example of UI for implementing intent-matching for code generation
    - form accepting intent queries like 'build streaming platform optimizing for metric c with these data sources'
    - user input can be a diagram of an optimal structure to generate:
      - upload a diagram positioning data sources, formatting/aggregation/analysis processes, metrics, query types, permissions, visuals, & target output, which produces various implementation diagrams the program derives, which the user selects between
        - including attributes/functions like:
          - which data should be streamed where
          - which data should be encrypted in what way
          - which actions should follow which actions
          - which data should be accessible by api, to which apps
          - which queries are expected, from which users/apps
    - identify uncertainties like config relevant to their intent and ask questions to confirm to reduce produced set of implementation diagrams

  - errors
    - If a problem/intent is not translatable to any interface, return an error and suggestion for additional information that could create a translatable problem that can be framed on an interface. 
      This error may be added to a store of information generated/derived/found during traversal if the problem statement cannot be mapped to a particular interface, to be included in the output 
      with the final solution metrics, for example "error: could not translate problem 'create schedule' to the attribute interface"). 
      If the problem cannot be mapped to an interface, log the error to be output with the final solution metrics ("error: could not translate problem 'create schedule' to the attribute interface"), and skip to the next interface in the specified sequence - if there is no next interface, return to interface selection, sequence & query design in step 403 by translating the problem to a more standard interface like the system or function or pattern interface.

  - outputs
    - return problem metadata derived or found, as well as solution space, solution set, or specific optimal solutions found, either ranked or as comparable alternatives or otherwise formatted
      - For a prediction problem, this may mean returning the function definition if a specific optimal function (solution) was found, or the function & variants with varying bias or other error metrics optimized (solution set) or a range of functions (solution space).  
    - compare & evaluate solutions, visualize problem space, describe solution steps & traversals to generate them, and optimize the traversal & program execution
    - listing some processes & components used as well as interim information derived during the traversal(s), and errors found or risk contributed by processing. 
    - optimal solution as a set of steps to compress the problem as well as solution metrics, attributes, & actions, and/or insights/patterns/system/ standardized description related to the problem if no solutions are found 

  - edits
      - After a solution has been generated/derived/found by the program, the program may include a secondary workflow involving an edit to the solution output. 
      - also allow the user to edit the problem space visualization component & examine the impact of other solutions, drill down into embedded object graphs in the problem space, move or otherwise change problem objects, & adjust displayed dimensions of the space like intent, which may trigger an execution of the problem definition, interface conversion & traversal process depending on the edits made. 
      - as the edit may optionally involve an edit to the problem space visualization, the edit may trigger a function to evaluate if a re-calculation of the solution is necessary, or if problem space visualization logic or solution output is sufficient to handle the edit (such as removing a dimension of the visualization). 
      - This step can involve user edits to the problem space visualization component of the user interface module 110, including edits like changing the position or other attributes of problem objects & their attributes/functions, applying different solutions in the solution set, changing the dimensions of the problem space. When the user edits the problem space visualization, the changes are sent to step 402 or later (depending on whether adjustment of the problem definition or conversion to the interface needs to be done & so on), where the calculations are executed to return the output of the new impact those edits would have on the problem space.

  - As shown in FIG. 1, and by reference number 110, the interface analysis module 140 may include a user interaction module 110 that may include any device or system or components thereof configured to receive user input and/or provide information to the user. For example, the user interaction module 110 may present an input to enter the intent of the interface analysis, an input for submitting information (a particular data set, document, or API), and inputs to configure the interface query, such as query priority & optimizations. 
      In some embodiments, user input may vary, such as where the input intent may be a custom intent which the system will attempt to translate into a structure of supported intents, or a selected supported intent. The output may be incomplete or otherwise sub-optimal, in which case the user can state the intent differently or add/format information differently, or re-configure the query. 
      The input validation will return a message if the program cannot correct the input information, configuration or intent, or may return a validation question to prompt the user to enter additional or updated information. 
      FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram depicting one embodiment of a component of the interface analysis module 140 of FIG. 23, the User Interface Module 110. Information displayed in the User Interface Module 110 may include structures from any of the other diagrams, given that the output sent to the User Interface Module 110 optionally includes query information about the processes run to generate the relevant output information 150.  

      - API finding & calling system used to:
          - find data like definitions, data sets, & insights, and from the user interaction module 110 to output the output information 150. 
          - use alternate data sources for the definitions & object metadata
          - use data sources rather than deriving information,
          - API finding/calling functionality will be executed to discover public or permitted data sources matching target objects
          
      - machine learning system may be used to:
          - identify a set of most likely factors contributing to a format mismatch or missing information, or a problem or sub-problem or solution
          - provide the correlations and/or the factors contributing to an input to the user interaction module 110 and/or the interface analysis module 140. 
          - generate data (or predict a definition)
          - identify relationships and/or correlations from a data set
          - analyze all solution examples and predict which solution would be the best implementation for a problem definition
          - analyze all sub-problem & problem associations stored in the database & predict which sub-problems would be the best way to break down a problem
          - analyze all previous queries on the solution automation module or interface analysis module and predict which factors will be used the most as inputs to show on the user interface module 110 

      - these standard methods (ml/api) can be used to find/generate the latest implementation or pre-computations for a solution or utility function (like sorting or indexing algorithms or testing tools), when local assets are compromised (in the absence of functions on interfaces described above) or when the user sets a preference for crowd-sourced or new tools, or if machine learning is specified as a preferred solution method on the UI
    
  - ui for solution automation
      As shown in FIG. 1A, and by reference number 110, the solution automation module 140 may include a user interaction module that may include any device or system or components thereof configured to receive user input and/or provide information to the user. For example, the user interaction module 110 may present an input to enter the problem statement and a set of filters (to refine the problem statement, or attach problem and/or problem space metadata such as expected complexity, known problem sub-problem, known problem factor, or preferred problem definition) as well as an input for common & other solution metrics (such as solution- finding time/cost, solution-implementing time/cost, accuracy, using pre-computed solutions or deriving solutions from scratch, using a particular data source for definitions & other API calls inserted into the workflow rather than using system-generated data sources from the initial or previous queries, etc) to a user. In these and other embodiments, the user may utilize the user interaction module 110 to identify problem & problem space metadata & solution metrics as an input filter to reduce the solution space and evaluate output solutions. In these and other embodiments, the user may additionally utilize the user interaction module 110 to identify output solutions of varying types (including optimal, low-cost, reusable, able to reduce other problems, able to invalidate a problem space, able to change a problem space to a very different one, etc) to create a score to store the output in the database as a solution (if the score is high) or a problem (if the score is low) associated with the origin problem statement. For example, the user may designate an output solution as optimal for solving a sub-problem of the origin problem, and the database will store a link between the sub-problem and the output solution as one of the sub-problem's optimal solutions. 
      In some embodiments, user input may vary, such as where the problem statement may be an abstract statement, a statement about a problem type, or missing necessary information. The output may be incomplete or otherwise sub-optimal, in which case the user can state the problem differently or add information or their own theory about the cause or solution, or expand the allowances of the configuration to include more pattern & derivation computations than more direct problem-solving methods or pre-computed solutions that may need updating. The problem statement validation will return a message if the program cannot correct the problem statement or return a validation question to prompt the user to enter specific information. Deriving problem metadata such as the minimum information to solve a problem or deriving solution requirements would take the form of logic such as identifying required probable solution structures necessary to solve the problem & information necessary for filtering solutions in that format or for a particular intent (if it's a shape, the solution needs to be in vector format and the dimensions need to be identified). The validation will also validate other input fields like problem metadata, so that a problem statement that doesn't match the specific problem type will return an error indicating that mismatch. 
      As shown in FIG. 1B, and by reference number 140, the example solution automation module 140 may be used to automate finding a solution for a problem statement, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. The solution automation module 140 may include a user interaction module 110 and a machine learning system 120 and an API finding & calling system 130 that may provide input to a solution automation module 140. The solution automation module 140 may facilitate determination of the solution 150 associated with the problem statement, and output the solution 150 to the user interaction module 110. 
      In some embodiments, such solution automation may lead to a solution for the problem, such as the cause of a problem, the intents fulfilled by a problem and/or the solution, a set of steps to reduce the problem, or a set of steps to neutralize or change the problem space containing the problem. In these and other embodiments, if a user is dissatisfied with the provided solution 150 (e.g., the solution is incomplete or no solution was found), the user may interact with the solution automation module 140 (e.g., to add more information or remove assumptions) and the solution automation may be run again. 
      This step can involve user edits to the problem space visualization component of the user interface module 110, including edits like changing the position or other attributes of problem objects & their attributes/functions, applying different solutions in the solution set, changing the dimensions of the problem space. When the user edits the problem space visualization, the changes are sent to step 402 or later (depending on whether adjustment of the problem definition or conversion to the interface needs to be done & so on), where the calculations are executed to return the output of the new impact those edits would have on the problem space.

      - checking the user input for validity, with regard to considerations like whether the input problem type matches the problem statement, then checking if the user input is valid (with regard to considerations like whether the input problem type matches the problem statement). If not, return error message or correction suggestion to the user interaction module 110, so the user can edit the inputs & re-submit the form. If valid, convert to concise problem statement & derive problem metadata not specified by user, such as problem variables (such as agency involved in the problem, etc), optimal problem format, sub-problem types, required information to solve, solution metrics to filter successful solutions, definition of solution success, etc. 

      - optional filters such as the origin interface, inputs for known metadata like the problem type, and inputs for solution metrics like a certain object structure or an attribute value. 
      - compare & evaluate solutions, visualize problem space, describe solution steps & traversals to generate them, and optimize the traversal & program execution, in the user interaction interface 110. This step involves listing some processes & components used as well as interim information derived during the traversal(s), and errors found or risk contributed by processing. 

      - if the re-calculation function is called & determines that a re-calculation is necessary, the program may determine which step contains the functionality for that re-calculation, and returns to that step, to create a new version of the solution output sent to the user interaction module 110. For example, in some embodiments, the program may determine if the edit requires returning to step 402 to re-define the problem definition, step 403 to execute interface selection, sequence & query design, or step 404 to convert to the same interface or a standard interface and execute the traversal generating the solution output. 
      
      - the user may modify or adjust one or more of the input filters provided to the solution automation module 140 regarding the problem/problem space/solution metadata derived and the origin interface & the formats selected for the problem-solution matching process. By iteratively repeating the process of adjusting the input filters by the user, the solution automation module 140 may repeatedly generate different solutions 150 until the user is satisfied with the solution 150. In some embodiments, the user may be dissatisfied with the solution based on preference the user has about their preferred optimal solution for the problem statement. In that case, they can add a filter to reduce the solution output, and if the program can find or derive the definition for that metric, it will apply it in the next query. If some metrics or formats contribute to uncertainty in the problem/solution filtering, formatting, compression, interface traversal, or other processes run by the program, the program will return output about the contribution of risky metrics to the uncertainty in the solution output. For example, if the user adds a custom filter like 'importance' and the program were to retrieve or derive an over-specific definition such as 'number of hub connections', it would cause distortions in the output, which would be included in the report as a risky filter that can be removed. Otherwise the solution may speed up the user's problem-solving process, to identify improvements to a product design, prediction function, or route with just a problem statement. 

      In some embodiments, this step may also allow the user to download solution steps, optimize the system or the traversal (skipping unnecessary nodes & so on), examine the queries that generated the solution, review the risk contributed by each filter or pattern or other risky object depended on by the solution or solution generation process, & execute other actions on the output information. 

      After a solution has been generated/derived/found by the program, the program may include a secondary workflow involving an edit to the solution output. 

      In some embodiments, this step may also allow the user to edit the problem space visualization component & examine the impact of other solutions, drill down into embedded object graphs in the problem space, move or otherwise change problem objects, & adjust displayed dimensions of the space like intent, which may trigger an execution of the problem definition, interface conversion & traversal process depending on the edits made. 

      In some embodiments, as the edit may optionally involve an edit to the problem space visualization, the edit may trigger a function to evaluate if a re-calculation of the solution is necessary, or if problem space visualization logic or solution output is sufficient to handle the edit (such as removing a dimension of the visualization). 

      In some embodiments, if the re-calculation function is called & determines that a re-calculation is necessary, the program may determine which step contains the functionality for that re-calculation, and returns to that step, to create a new version of the solution output sent to the user interaction module 110

      In some embodiments, if the re-calculation function is called & determines that no re-calculation is necessary, the program may adjust the solution output according to the edit, using visualization logic & output information. 

      In some embodiments, solutions that optimize metrics not specified by the user may be included in the output, such as solutions optimizing the user-specified solution metric and metrics that impact other problem-solvers, like the environment. For example, even if a user didn't request clean energy solutions for their traversal to find the optimal implementation of a Air Conditioning unit, the program may still return energy-conserving solutions like automatically shutting itself off when target temperature is reached, given that this energy- conserving solution optimizes more metrics than the requested solution, or that other users preferred the energy-conserving solution metric, or that the program identified energy- conserving solution metrics as conserving available resources, which would not only improve cross-system design for many agents using the program but also increase the likelihood that the program would have energy to run parallel processing or large queries or self-maintenance & self-optimization logic.
