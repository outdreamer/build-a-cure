      - mapping function, to map objects to structures, functions, & other object types 
          - graph an object, like the example problem space visualization depicts a problem space object & problem objects of the problem space in FIG. 6
            - FIG. 6 depicts a problem space of building information technology with differentiating attributes like Resource Limits, Standard, & Priority, including problem objects indicating problems (like Finding or Derivation problems) that exist in that space & differ in those attributes.
          - graph a related object network (as shown in FIGS. 6 - 7) & other relevant objects 
            - FIGS. 6 - 7 contain a network system relating relevant problem objects. 
            Problems like info problems, pattern problems, & derivation problems are adjacent (similar) and have similar dependence structures, because they are alternatives, and act as interfaces in hte problem network.
            The resource limits, priority, and standard generating the problem space of info problems & related problems might be limited derivation technology resources, a priority to find rather than derive information, and a standard information format.
            Other variables that can determine the shape of a problem space include other interface objects (a problem generating the problem space, unanswered questions, perspectives, default structures, attributes like relevance, etc). 
            Resourcs can refer to any object potentially having value (information, technology, information-derivation protocols like science, social resources, physical resources, time, etc).
            Priorities can narrow the focus of the problems or incentivize motion in a particular direction - like a priority to acquire resources, a priority to distribute information or rights, a priority to respect existing laws, etc)
            A standard applied to the problem space can mean a format, a particular definition of a concept like similarity, or a reducing function that isolates particular attributes, like how cause narrows the focus to dependency relationships, inputs & outputs.


      - this function relies on the 'structure-finding' function of find_format_for_metric.py
