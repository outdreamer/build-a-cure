    1. obtaining input information from a program or user (like a data set of possibly related variables, or objects in a relational database) 
    2. retrieving an interface definition 
    3. deriving the interface definition if not found 
    4. determining relevant interfaces or interface structures 
    5. determining an interface query structure to organize relevant interfaces or interface structures 
    6. execute query, checking for information needed after each interface or interface structure traversal 
    7. applying the interface definition to standardize the information to the interface format, which involves: 
    8. integrating output into a structure relevant to the requested intent (on the meaning or interface-interface), which involves applying structure to the output information as designated in the interface query design 


As shown in FIG. 1, and by reference number 110, the interface analysis module 140 may include a user interaction module 110 that may include any device or system or components thereof configured to receive user input and/or provide information to the user. For example, the user interaction module 110 may present an input to enter the intent of the interface analysis, an input for submitting information (a particular data set, document, or API), and inputs to configure the interface query, such as query priority & optimizations. 
    In some embodiments, user input may vary, such as where the input intent may be a custom intent which the system will attempt to translate into a structure of supported intents, or a selected supported intent. The output may be incomplete or otherwise sub-optimal, in which case the user can state the intent differently or add/format information differently, or re-configure the query. 
    The input validation will return a message if the program cannot correct the input information, configuration or intent, or may return a validation question to prompt the user to enter additional or updated information. 
    FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram depicting one embodiment of a component of the interface analysis module 140 of FIG. 23, the User Interface Module 110. Information displayed in the User Interface Module 110 may include structures from any of the other diagrams, given that the output sent to the User Interface Module 110 optionally includes query information about the processes run to generate the relevant output information 150.  
As shown in FIG. 2, and by reference number 140, the interface analysis module 140 may be used to automate formatting/filtering output information for an input intent task & information, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. The interface analysis module 140 may include a user interaction module 110 and a machine learning system 120 and an API finding & calling system 130 that may provide input to a interface analysis module 140. The interface analysis module 140 may facilitate determination of the output information 150 associated with the input intent, and return the output information 150 to the user interaction module 110. 
    In some embodiments, such interface analysis may lead to output information for the intent, such as the cause of a variable, a set of recommended steps, or a list of organized priorities. In these and other embodiments, if a user is dissatisfied with the provided output information 150 (e.g., the information is incomplete or no information was found), the user may interact with the interface analysis module 140 (e.g., to add more information or remove assumptions) and the interface analysis may be run again. 
    The interface analysis module 140 may include any device or system or components thereof configured to utilize the inputs from the machine learning system 120 to predict a variable or the API finding & calling system 130 to find data like definitions, data sets, & insights, and from the user interaction module 110 to output the output information 150. 
As shown in FIG. 3, and by reference number 120, the interface analysis module 140 may include a machine learning system. In some implementations, the machine learning model, used to predict a variable, may include a supervised machine learning model (e.g., a decision tree learning model, a learning classifier systems model, a nearest neighbor model, a support vector machine model, and/or the like), an unsupervised machine learning model (e.g., a clustering model, a neural network model, a latent variable model, and/or the like), or a combination of the aforementioned, described elsewhere herein. 
    The machine learning system 120 may include any machine learning system configured to identify relationships and/or correlations from a data set. For example, the machine learning system 120 may be configured to identify a set of most likely factors contributing to a format mismatch or missing information. 
    In these and other embodiments, the machine learning system 120 may provide the correlations and/or the factors contributing to an input to the user interaction module 110 and/or the interface analysis module 140. 
    In some embodiments, the machine learning system 120 may operate using any machine learning technique or deep learning technique, such as decision tree learning, association rule learning, clustering, reinforcement learning, representation learning, genetic algorithms, etc. In some embodiments, the machine learning system 120 may be utilized to perform a task, such as providing a recommendation of input filters to show in the user interface module 110 based on previous queries of the interface analysis module 140. 
As shown in FIG. 4, and by reference number 130, the interface analysis module 140 may include an API finding/calling system. 
    In some embodiments, the user may want to use alternate data sources for the definitions & object metadata, or use data sources rather than deriving information, in which case API finding/calling functionality will be executed to discover public or permitted data sources matching target objects, or the data can be generated (or the definition predicted) using a standard machine learning model. Similarly these standard methods can be used to retrieve or generate the latest implementation or pre-computations for a solution or utility function (like sorting or indexing algorithms or testing tools), when local assets are compromised or when the user sets a preference for crowd-sourced or new tools.
