	- FIG. 5. 'Structure Application Function - Apply Function' illustrates applying a structure to another structure. 

          - function to apply an object to another object, as shown in FIG. 5 (Structure Application Function - Apply Function) 
            - example: applying a 'route optimization' solution may take the form of adjusting the system structure to invalidate the route, may attach a function to nodes, or inject an efficiency structure to the system, which may also reduce the problem dimensions in the problem space visualization in addition to changing the system structure in the associated visualized system-structure interface format of the problem. 
            - FIG. 5 depicts the application of a solution to a problem space (standardized to the problem interface) in the top left, specifically the solution of adding an efficiency to the system, which reduces the problem dimensions (like resource limits), leading to smaller problem objects & decreased distance between problem objects.
            - It also depicts the application of a solution to the problem-containing system format (standardized to the system interface) in the top right, specifically the solution of adding an efficiency (like an alternate charging station in between nodes, or a position-switching function to each node) to the system, which removes the need for an optimized route between A & C.
            - Below these two examples, on the bottom half of FIG. 5, the figure depicts an example of applying the structural definition of an information function to information. This solution applies the structural definition of the Allocation function (in which information is distributed to other system positions), to the Input Info Distribution structure, to produce the Allocated Info Distribution structures. 
            - The Allocated Info Distribution structures are structures of examples of two solutions: Solution 1 applies the 'allocate' function to both information resources, and Solution 2 applies the 'allocate' function to unique information resource.
