'''
	this function applies logic specific to each interface in an interface traversal
	
    - problem space analysis: visualizing problem metadata & related problem network, and changes to the problem space that invalidate the original or other problems once a particular solution is applied
    - core analysis: automatically finding core objects/functions/attributes/states possible to determine/describe a system, defining core operations like find/apply/build/derive
    - system analysis: automatically fitting system objects like symmetries, sub-systems, sub-interfaces, false assumptions, correlations, efficiencies, incentives, and conflicts to problem definition to determine optimal organization/format/routes/metrics/positions
    - structure analysis: automatically finding structures, like a route between information formats to solve a problem
    - information analysis
      - insight analysis: insight path application (using insight paths from other fields to optimize insight generation)
      - problem analysis: formatting to convert problems to a format with more solution methods, such as problem vectorization (mapping the problem definition to a directed network with inputs on one side, interim inferred important problem concepts in between, and target priorities or attributes on the other, linked by available functions)
      - question analysis: where a question is framed as a source position and a target position on a network, and the answer is the most robust path or the path that moves the nearest to the target position or the path that moves in the priority direction on the network
    - change analysis: automatically identifying change metadata like change types necessary to explain a solution or solve a problem
      - potential analysis: automatically finding structures of variance like gaps/cascades/reducers, possibility fields, and determining/limiting vertices
    - logical analysis
      - function analysis: automatically identifying function metadata like variables, input/output trajectory, the function in a filter format, intent, complexity, efficiency, & exploits
      - intent analysis: automatically finding possible reasons to use a function to automate logic
      - causal analysis: automatically matching the problem to causal structures to infer relevant variables & causation metadata (like directness of cause, degree of cause, inevitability, uniqueness of cause, causal tree/network/loop/layer shape)
      - pattern analysis: automatically finding patterns with relevant similarities to infer the relevance of pattern metadata, where patterns replace missing required data (such as using patterns between variables of specific types or system positions to infer probable variable relationships)
    - concept analysis: automatically identifying concepts associated with a structure & vice versa, identifying positions of default abstract concepts in the network
    - interface analysis: identifying a problem-solving automation workflow to derive/apply, mapping a query across combination or embedded interfaces given problem requirements, or identifying a specific or new interface to define/query
