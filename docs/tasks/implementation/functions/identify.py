'''
  - identify function: a function can be reduced to a 'change unit'

  - identify object: an object has attributes/functions and is not itself either of those (for standard definition of object, even though both attributes/functions can be framed as objects)

  - identify attribute: attributes can be reduced to 'position', implemented as a:

      - relationship type (relative difference)
      - structure type (shape)
      - change type (generators of difference)

    - the structural network can frame these position differences to capture all attributes
    - add function to derive structures of an object given its attributes/functions (related attribute sets indicating a type or sub-system, etc)
