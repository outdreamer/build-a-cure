''' function to format input intent as organized structure in the form of an interface query (step 1 of program flow)

    1. obtaining input information from a program or user (like a data set of possibly related variables, or objects in a relational database) 
    2. retrieving an interface definition 
    3. deriving the interface definition if not found 
    4. determining relevant interfaces or interface structures 
    5. determining an interface query structure to organize relevant interfaces or interface structures 
    6. execute query, checking for information needed after each interface or interface structure traversal 
    7. applying the interface definition to standardize the information to the interface format, which involves: 
    8. integrating output into a structure relevant to the requested intent (on the meaning or interface-interface), which involves applying structure to the output information as designated in the interface query design
