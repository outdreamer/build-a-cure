  - definition: 
    - indexing objects by structure allows clear matching of useful structures to objects/attributes/types/rules 
    - this allows objects to be graphed in a standard way, which means translating objects like problems into a computable interface 
    - anything that has its own internal gravity can be modeled as a physics system, but if it has its own internal operations like how to traverse the interface network, it also has a description system which can be mapped to structure
    - involves assigning shapes/formats/structures/spaces
      - mapping a structure to an item (value, variable, object, type, system etc) requires an algorithm that:
        - matches variance with structure change potential

  - attributes (order, balance, equivalence, accuracy/fit, position) 
  - objects (comparison, combination, permutation, approximation, metric, activator, trade/cost/benefit, change, filter) 
  - concepts (equivalent, alternate, substitute, opposite, inverse) 

  - related objects

    - related questions

      - how to identify components with structural attributes like chainability (cause, risk, variance, errors, gaps, limits) or variability
      - how to identify a shape fitting information: chain/stack/network/mix/layer, adjacent shapes, or emergent info shapes like alignments/gaps/conflicts
          - will a type stack (which type values on different type layers) or a network/tree (type hierarchy) be a more useful structure to capture a type relationship
      - identify compression/conversion functions of a shape
      - this interface can also be used for specific attribute analysis, of properties that descend from concepts & take form in a specific problem space:
        - the power concept interface (has structures that look like trust, info, etc)
        - the balance concept interface (has structures that look like symmetry, justice, etc)
        
      - how to evaluate shape potential
        - given an object and the topology of its potential emergent interactions with each other object, what is the set of potential shapes that can interact with (build, coexist, coordinate, use, neutralize, destroy, or be built by) this object, given the full range of interaction topologies and combinations of the same?
        - example: 
          - given a molecule and the topologies of its interactions with other interactable molecules, what is the function generating the set of macromolecules that molecule can contribute to the assembly of in a way that enables a high ratio of component-substitutions or component-derivation from other components in the absence of one?
            - given the full set of these generating functions, which molecules/molecule combinations are the best contributors/collaborators/derivers/substiters/hubs?
          - given a variable and the topologies of its interactions with other interactable variables, what is the function generating the set of functions that variable can contribute to the assembly of in a way that enables a high ratio of variable-substitutions or variable-derivation from other variables in the absence of one?
            - this goes beyond indexing isolated variables by metadata (such as variable type), to incorporate the metadata of variable interactions embedded in a relationship

  - structures: 
    - dimension
    - layer: parameter determining variance accretion interfaces where interactions develop
    - space: dimension set
    - scale, range, spectrum
    - group: set, potentially across dimensions (cluster of data points)
    - position (point)
    - line: position link
    - sequence
    - center: possible in a shape with symmetries
    - vector: line with restricted metadata (direction & magnitude)
    - circuit: series of lines moving at angles that allow returning to origin point
    - network: linked points
    - tree: network with direction
    - stack: layers representing variables or variants within a type with values (trajectory between points in layers)
    - topology, manifold: permutation set with symmetric properties
    - distance: variance in a similarity measure
    - origin: starting point
    - point: value set of dimensions
    - angle: comparative measure of divergence between paths with same starting point
    - direction: output attribute from input origin given a space-traversal object (line)
    - boundary/edge/limit: extremes of resource combination generative potential
    - inflection: metric change limit (maxima/minima of rate of change)
    - intersection: conflict/overlap
    - tangent: line of least nonzero interactions with another line
    - ratio
    - symmetry
    - scalar
    - path
    - expansion
    - progression
    - distribution
    - combination/contextual/conceptual structures:
      - unit (isolatable entity)
      - comparison (rate)
      - combination (group)
      - permutation
      - interface (common attribute or attribute set)
      - trigger
      - trade
      - variance
      - pattern
      - change
      - state (combination of structure & information)
      - filter/standard (reduce)
      - perspective (focus)
      - equivalent, alternate, substitute, opposite, inverse

  - functions: 
    - identify components with structural attributes like chainability (cause, risk, variance, errors, gaps, limits) or variability 
    - identify a shape fitting information: chain/stack/network/mix/layer, adjacent shapes, or emergent info shapes like alignments/gaps/conflicts 
      - will a type stack (which type values on different type layers) or a network/tree (type hierarchy) be a more useful structure to capture a type relationship 
    - identify compression/conversion functions of a shape 
    - identify structures in objects: which objects are chained (cause, risk, variance, errors, gaps, limits), which are dimensions (isolatable attributes of change patterns), which have position 
    - find important structures (combinations/layers/matches/differences/sub-components) 
    - map structures (function sets) to target structures (sequences), given a metric like progression toward goal 
      - identify sub-components 
      - a function to convert an object between formats (function => attribute sequence, function => filter sequence, etc) by mapping attributes & functions & other metadata of the objects & removing attributes that don't fit in the target format definition (for example, if you're converting to a type, the output should be in an attribute set format)  
      - a function to identify structure matching a pattern (like identify a structure embodying a mismatch, which is a problem type, given a system network definition, where the system could represent an object, function, or attribute)  
    - structure identification functions 
      - identify shape: chain/stack/network/mix/layer 
      - identify adjacent shapes 
      - identify compression functions of shape given target dimensions 
      - identify transformation functions of shape given source/target shape 
      - identify alignments/symmetries/gaps/conflicts 
      - choosing between structures (like nodes & links) to model another structure (objects in a network): 
        - node: many connections to many other objects having a similar property, like having a type in common, usually unique 
        - links: usually many connections between two objects at a time, having many possible variations, can be repeated 
      - example of structural analysis by applying a particular structure: 
        - time analysis: as time increases, what changes: 
              - position 
              - value (position on a dimension) 
              - distance (position from a base point) 
          - changing position based on embedded time 
          - as change increases, what structures change (which structures are stable even in certain change rates) 
      - apply other standard structural bases as alternatives to time, where change is on a y-axis, and these parameters are on the x-axis 
          - order: changes are framed based on order - to examine change patterns with respect to order (where unit order is original/standard and highest order is most different order possible) 
          - position: changes are framed based on difference from previous position, starting from the standard unit position (default) - for examining change patterns with respect to position distortion 
          - distance: changes are framed based on distance type (distance from value, distance from number type, distance from pattern) - for examining change patterns with respect to distance type 
          - value: changes are framed based on value type (exponential, constant, pattern value, symmetric value, origin value) - for examining change patterns with respect to value 
          - set: changes are framed based on set membership (number type (prime), pattern (progression), distance (adjacent groups)) - for examining change patterns with respect to sets 
          - space: changes are framed based on spaces where that change can be framed (topologies, dimensions, vector spaces) - where spaces are formed by adding dimension units 
      - mapping a structure to an item (value, variable, object, type, system etc) requires an algorithm that: 
        - matches variance with structure change potential 
      - organization/format analysis 
          - optimal path/distribution/states 
          - what would the optimal path be, given a certain intent, object identity, & host system? 
          - "what is the function linking these variables that is most efficient/involves fewest variables/involves known constants?" 
          - identify layer to solve a problem at 
          - identify key objects needed to solve a problem 
          - identify structures for information 
      - market structure analysis
        - the market interface is a standard interface where resources (goods, labor, time, risk, information, expectations, theories, & stored prior labor (currency)) are traded
        - a useful new way to use this is to frame non-resource objects as resources (systems, structures, positions, paths, directions, risk chains, trade loops, markets)
        - then you can apply traditional market analysis (optimal transport) to find, for example, the optimal set of trades to change an industry's position
      - for a problem of type 'conflict', like vectors aiming at a corner of a closed shape (where the shape is formed by the intersections of limiting attributes), the structural way to solve that problem is:
        - reducing the angle of the corner 
          which reduces the difference between corners (and the incentive to aim for a corner) & adds extra alternatives
          - the solution is an example of 'false limit' - the limit of there being a finite supply of corners or the limit of one route occupying a position at a given time can be surmounted with extra resources
        - reducing incentive to aim at corners
          - if the shape has fewer corners, there will be less incentive for internal vectors to aim there
        - reducing motion
          - if the shape has a stable state, the motion of the internal vectors can be reduced or staggered at intervals for resource-distribution
        - adding motion
          - use types of motion to distribute the vectors so they aim at different corners
      - you could apply these methods of solving the structural problem to the original problem 
        (a conflict like competition or overflow or false limit or false alignment if the vectors dont need to aim for the same corner)
      - the way to assign 'conflict' problem type to the closed shape structure with internal vectors is by aligning attributes 
        (incentives that organize motion to create an oversupply of resources (motion vectors) that cant be supported by a resource (position))

- examples

  - info shapes: if you become dependent on info, youre always looking backward, using metrics/rules/info sources chosen in the past, with past info

  - ethical Shapes

      - if someone attacks their neighbor:
        - the neighbor can retaliate
        - or the neighbor can recognize that the hit was not relevant to them but to prior attack chains, and hit the source of that attack chain that attacked their neighbor,
          so rather than continuing the chain, the neighbor creates a causal circle, directing consequences toward the relevant source of the problem
      - there are ethical shapes for each ethical problem type

  - insight Shapes (Unit, Paths)

    - use patterns in network structures & insight paths to predict:
      - probable missing pieces of networks
      - insight path of a route type (optimal/realistic)
      - insight path trajectory for a particular assumption set

  - interface Shapes

    - interface: filter/standard for comparison of specific attribute(s)
    - interfaces evolve when a unifying attribute (priority, cause, structure) can frame a set of developing variances
    - interfaces, standards, & perspectives are all filters
      - an interface can be specific but on the general interface network, it offers a standard for multiple related attributes or causative attributes 
        (types/intents/patterns offer a way to interact with all layers of a system)
      - whereas a perspective is focused on a very restricted set of variables, with the intention of distorting reality to highlight information that other perspectives dont make clear

  - variance Shapes: given that variance flows through systems in patterns, what are the common variance shapes, given host system type & structure + set of unknowns?
  - pattern Shapes: given that observed patterns often have patterns, what are the common pattern & pattern-generation shapes, given variance level & observation tools?
  - prediction Shapes: given that predictions are often between similarly complex systems & target metrics, what the common shapes of predictions, given system type & structure and metric type + set of unknowns?
  - certainty Shapes
    - while risk shapes store a ratio of shape coverage, certainty shapes store a compression of a shape
    - uncertainty shapes include variance gaps & questions

  - causal shapes
    - most causal shapes are cyclical, tensor, layer, or network-shaped rather than one-directional vector-shaped, which is why some existing methods are inherently incapable of producing system-fitted insights that wont break the system when applied (a particular drug that is not evaluated for bio-system impact, just impact on a particular pathogen or process)

  - math interface: matrix
    - find out method to determine adjacent matrix representations for a particular function, and use it in reverse to determine likely functions for a matrix
    - alternative methods of framing a matrix
      - operator interface: 
        - applying operations to vector sets within the vector set (custom operators to operate on, convert between, or generate the specific vectors in the matrix) & examining the output metrics
        - example:
          - ratio space of a matrix includes the output of vector ratios for properties associated with ratios (like rate of change or similarity) that can be used to describe the vector set
      - path interface:
        - applying path analysis to find paths across features in the matrix that reflect its properties
      - data interface:
        - applying statistical analysis to vectors as variable values/data points of a polynomial (coefficients being variables) or a function set
      - function interface:
        - finding relevant generator functions of matrix
      - state interface:
        - finding adjacent states that fit a common/useful/relevant transform pathway

  - market trade loops: independence can be created with closed trade loops
    - the most basic example is where agent A produces everything agent B needs, and vice versa
