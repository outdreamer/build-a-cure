  - example of the analysis for this interface: 
    - this describes the common components that can build other analysis types 
  - objects (interface objects like patterns & concepts) 
  - structures (core structures (intersections, hubs, vertices, maps, limits, symmetries, & alignments)) 
  - concepts (abstract concepts (similarity, power)) 
  - attributes: 
    - interface attributes (intent/priority, potential/certainty, perspective, causality, abstraction) 
    - commonness, scope, optimization, completeness, randomness, reusability, complexity, dependence 
    - contexts (coordinating/opposing, use cases, extreme cases, examples) 
    - coordinatability: integration potential 
    - interaction layer: which objects it interacts with, on what layers of a system like abstraction/scope layer 
    - injectability: can it be used as an input, in many operations 
    - emergence: is it generatable from other objects 
    - neutrality: the range of operations/contexts it can be used for 
    - automation/optimization potential (resource investment, rule stabilization)  
    - applicable definitions (like for equivalence)  
    - minimum object identification information (required identity attributes)  
    - relationships  
      - interface queries that can produce this object 
      - adjacent/related objects of same/different type  
      - problems with adjacent objects & how those problems are generated by adjacent object metadata  
      
  - functions (structural functions: combine, merge, apply, embed, mix, filter, chain, define, create, derive, identify, change, version)         

    - function to derive core component functions for any system - then you can write functions to calculate function metadata:
        - determine equivalent functions or more optimal version of a function
        - determine function intent
        - alter core functions used to alter function intent
        - when generating solutions, change core functions to vary to describe any function set that builds any other function set in a system
          - set of binding/interaction/priority functions for element atoms

    - target objects of problem space analysis to find an 'ethical' or other algorithm to guide an object through a system:

      - events that reduce potential (irreversible outcomes like an agent death)
      - intent vs. outcome within context (repeated intents & exploits of intent stacks for malicious intents)
      - symmetries like ambiguity, potential, & alternative-generating paths/bases
      - assumptions/limits (neutral intents are likelier to be used maliciously than positive intents)
      - context trajectory (such as maintaing a path through contexts to avoid calculations)

      - once these objects are identified as necessary to understand the problem, then the implemented objects can be identified in the problem space, & the solution can be calculated

    - derive the context set that a prediction function has varying degrees of success in (type distance, missing variables, changing problem space, etc)
      - this can be used to reduce the uncertainty by first identifying which contexts a function will be successful in predicting and then checking for those contexts in the problem space

    - rank methods of structure application for different contexts
      - expansion/compression (by intent, function, etc)
      - filters/connections
      - systematization
    
    - prediction/change/context as fundamental function objects

    - function generators:
        structural shapes (subset, limit, gap) & operations are all functions
        movement functions
        shape functions
        relationship functions
        type functions
        changing structural attributes (position) generates functions (move, polish, align, combine, etc)

          - convert/translate/format
          - change reversal/compounding
          - differentiation (commitment to a state from a core state)

        - functions for the set of core conceptual math operations between concepts
          - core function + core object -> interaction rule of core attributes that aligns with core function + core object priority
          - depict core functions on their own direction to indicate a dimension when graphing

        - competition (built by change/find/test functions)
        - finding/borrowing/generating functionality & other resources (built by find/build functions)

    - sub-system functions

    - interim functions
        - provide resources used as inputs to activate other functions (a set of molecules that when detached can activate other processes)
        - these functions may be cross-system, or may be unnecessary middlemen in a function chain whose functionality should be merged with other functions
      
    - platform functions
        - provide platform for functionality (variance allowing functionality to develop on foundational structures)

        - explicit (such as 'convert input energy into output structure')
        - implicit (such as unintended side effects of outputs, interim functions between input/output, and unpredicted emergent functions at scale or across many linked integrated function chains)

  - system layer analysis: 

    - apply combinations of core operations to get information object layers ('democracy games', 'barriers to intents or false information') once definitions are standardized to system interface

      perspective: priority set with object positions & default paths
      strategy: efficient path between points
      joke: difference between expected & actual position
      error: difference between expected & actual decision
      argument: position of objects or path between points with supporting connective functions
      game: incentivized motion within a system having limits to prevent motion
      filter: barrier creating a difference between input & output

    - core system layer analysis (where you generate next generation of objects using core operations supported in the space) can be used to harden a system against risk inherent in using defined objects, which will inevitably change, such as identifying new structures & interactions of the concept of risk given the next layer of imminent objects in a system

    - apply the set of core structures, functions, objects, and attributes to itself to get next layer of transforms & systems to run next error analysis
      - attribute spaces (object model + structure interface = a calculation method for attributes)
      - false similarity (info interface attribute + core attribute = an error type/definition route, if agency is involved)
      - filter chains (structure interface + structure interface = a core object to frame info)

    - function to identify next gen object layers would apply attribute changes & stack operations to get the structural definition routes
