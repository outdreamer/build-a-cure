  - definition: 
    - the system interface is the structural version of the meaning interface
    - the fundamental system question 'how does info fit in a system' is relevant to the fundamental meaning question 'what structures are relevant to this intent'
    - this is a format accessible once information is standardized to object model 
    - this involves framing information as a connected network with a boundary defining the system, that has core system operations, structures, & objects 
  - structures: 
    - structural system objects like connections/boundaries 
    - structures applying info system objects like variance/dependencies/equivalencies/efficiencies/incentives/asymmetries (info/risk/time) 
  - objects: 
    - information objects (contradictions, implications, perspective)
    - structure objects (direction, boundary, node, connection, filter)
    - system objects (inefficiencies, incentives, errors, alternatives, opportunities)
    - variance objects like variance injection points (gaps in rule enforcement) & variance sources (problem types, gaps in system boundary allowing variance from other systems to leak in) 
    - tradeoffs: options with mutually exclusive contradictory benefits (if you take one option, you have to sacrifice the other), often a false trade-off or dichotomy applied when both are simultaneous options rather than contradictory 
    - incentives: a reason to take an action (a benefit or cost) - usually interpreted as default in a system 
    - inefficiency: defined as not using a cost-reduction or benefit-increasing method (using extra unnecessary resources, not using a requirement-reduction method, not reusing solutions, etc) 
    - opportunity: potential move with a potential benefit, with a limited time component 
    - exploit opportunities: opportunity with temporary local (selfish) benefits that allocates cost disproportionately to the system (destroying a system-maintenance concept like 'trust' or 'rule of law') or other objects in the system, with negative emergent side effects (hoarding resource incentives, requirement for monitoring & rule enforcement investment, misallocation of justice) 
    - vertices: important variables that generate/cause/determine/change system development, preferably all of the above but also variables that execute a subset
  - functions (optimize, traverse, open/close, apply system filters, reduce dependencies, close variance injection points, enforce rule, identify system objects given their definition, such as a variance gap, map a system layer graph representing combinations, identify/derive system context, find interactions of interaction spaces (which interactions are common across agents, likely given other interactions, etc)) 
    - function to generate a different object (like a different concept network) by varying attributes: 
      - example: if power favored centralization, another core concept like balance would have to favor a chaotic process or not exist at all, or another core concept would need to be added to the network 
    - function to predict which system filters will be useful based on a system priority 
  - attributes (cohesiveness) 
      - relationship metadata (related systems, system position in system interface network)
  - concepts: closed system (a system that can exist without other systems), optimized system (a system that generates zero variance, whose inputs/outputs are all connected without side effects) 
  - answers questions like: 
    - what known/potential inputs/outputs available in the system could build the path?
    - what is the function linking these variables, given the core functions used to build this system?
    - how can this system be optimized 
    - are too many assumptions hard-coded in this system 
    - is this system capable of a particular function 
    - does this system coordinate with other systems in a stable way 
    - is this system adjacently exploitable 
    - does this system contain more potential (options) than it needs 
    - what input/output paths are available that can achieve a particular intent 
    - where would this system generate coincidentally similar structures (a query to identify false similarities) 
    - what system structures (or buildable system structures) fit in this unknown information-generating sub-system 
    - system-problem interface: what problem types does this system have (gaps, misalignments, mismatches, inefficiencies & conflicts)
    - predict which system filters will be useful based on a system priority (the problem of adding/fitting/reducing structure, which can be used to solve related problems like prediction: which variables are explanatory given what we can measure, and causation: how alternatives can converge to the same level of variance/change patterns)
    - how does a system become overwhelmed with variance (in various forms, including randomness), does it have outlets like interfaces with other systems to delegate variance
    - as change increases, how does context change (where unit of context are additional conditions)

## System objects

  - why is it so useful to use system objects like inefficiency or structural objects like asymmetry as a way to frame & solve problems automatically? 
    - bc these objects offer the most flexibility so they can capture the most variation, and occupy an interim interface between physical reality & conceptual networks, so its a good interface to standardize those interfaces to, theyre standard core objects with high interaction potential on similar interaction layers
    - most of the system filter insight paths represent efficiencies & symmetries that become system defaults
      - copying is more efficient than generating an entirely new object, so attribute alignments tend to develop in systems
      - objects with existing (lower cost) alignments tend to cluster into attribute sets
      - most systems need to handle change and constants cant handle change, so constants tend to be fewer in number than variables
      - ambiguities tend to develop in systems with more randomness bc randomness triggers more new interactions, which make change that may stabilize to the normal distribution more efficient, & create objects with similarities, obscuring cause

  - how to generate interface filters (system, type, function), starting with unit interfaces function & attribute:
      abstract    pattern
      set     system
      subset    filter
    function    
      intersect   change (convert attribute to function)
    attribute
      set     type

  - you could extend this to find new objects on the next outer layer after another transform/combination

  - example of system object 'alternate routes'
    - an alternate route is an important system object that can be used to reduce solution spaces for analyzing causation in a system
    - a definition can be more useful if framed in objects on a certain interface
    - equal
      - indistinguishable given measurable attributes & their values - equal in value
      - symmetric (buildable with components the other is built with) - equal in origin (resource attribute set indicating starting position)
      - independent (not buildable with the components that the other is built with) - not equal in origin

The most common useful filtering objects to build insight paths are:
- similarities/differences
- core functions
- boundary rules (enforced & unenforced)
- variance injection points
- attribute alignments (similarities, equivalents, alternates, opposites - real & false)
- causal direction/degree
- embedding direction (do you use a tree of networks or a network of trees to frame a pattern)
- symmetry stacks (example: diverging in position, then diverging in shape, then diverging in color)
- intersecting patterns
- interaction space
- potential field
- neutralizing/invalidating rules
- efficiency overlap
- vertex intersection
- tradeoff spectrums
- optimality topology (optimizing in one metric direction as a tradeoff or adjacent to optimizing in another)

How to generate this list of useful filtering objects to evaluate a system:
  You apply core concepts to core components on core interfaces until you reach a function/object/attribute that explains/generates/determines/summarizes a system:
    "filter_generation_map": {
      "equivalence of core structure": "alignment"
    }
    - "equivalence" is the core concept, the core interface is "structure", and the core structure metric is "direction"
    - "equivalence of direction on the structure interface" parses to "alignment", which is a useful filter for evaluating a system.
  This filter can be applied to generate the next outer layer of filters:
    {
      "alignment of core system component": "attribute alignment"
    }
    which is a "core concept (filters.alignment) of core component (attribute) on a core interface (system)"

What kind of information can you apply to a system once its framed as a set of generative filters to highlight its inconsistencies:
  - change: base (average, randomness, extreme, balance)
  - intent: completeness (in combinations) for an intent
