'''
  - definition 
    - a concept is an object in a system that: 
      - extends the core components of the system in a new way (introducing a new object on the system layer graph of core component combinations) 
      - acts as an interface (for change, randomness, etc) or determinant of change 
      - has attributes/functionality beyond its definition in that space (can have one function in one system context & another emerging function in a particular state & environment) 
      - example: power is the object left when objects implementing it: resources => energy => input => potential) have their context removed, navigating up the abstraction stack from the info layer (resources & energy), removing their contextual attributes/rules, to the abstract structural layer (input) , to the abstract layer (potential, which is a related concept of power) , so that the final object is defined in terms of other abstract objects on the top layer  
    - the abstract network is a set of related concept objects remaining after removing context, concepts that are applicable across systems, often have multiple definition routes because they take a variety of forms given the context, and are fundamental to describing a system. A subset of the abstract network is depicted in FIG. 15. Concept definition network, which shows concepts related to 'relevance'. 
      - so that the final object is defined in terms of other abstract objects on the top layer 
    - a non-abstract concept is an abstract concept with structure applied (in a particular system), like how a particular definition of similarity in a system can evolve from the abstract concept of equivalence 
    - this interface can be used for specific attribute analysis, of properties that descend from concepts & take form in a specific problem space: 
      - the power concept interface (has structures that look like trust, info, etc) 
      - the balance concept interface (has structures that look like symmetry, justice, etc) 
  - objects (abstract network of structural, irreducible cross-system concepts, like power, balance, etc) 
  - structures (abstraction layer (level of specificity/certainty in a structure), systems where the concept fits as an interaction object, trajectory to generate the concept in conceptual networks) 
  - concepts: definability (how clear is the definition, given the level of structure like context applied, making a concept concrete rather than abstract) 
  - attributes (abstraction, uniqueness, isolatability) 
  - functions: 
    - function to identify/derive/define concepts in a system (unique objects in a system that cant be defined in terms of standard operations on other objects) 
      - example: 'meaning' concept definition (relevance/structure) is based on attributes like reduction of signals (relevance) and matching of signal structures (similarity) 
    - function to identify abstract concepts, by attributes like whether they: 
      - can take many structures (the concept of equivalence has many possible implementations) 
      - can impact many systems varying by system attributes or system types (abstract, calculatable, variable, understood, types, functional, prioritized, optimized) 
      - cannot be perfectly defined as a simple function of other objects, but rather are definable with a set of simple, core boundary rules that differentiate them from other concepts 
        - these boundary rules do not involve other concepts on the same layer, but rather core components 
        - for example, the core components of common shapes are: line, point, curve, corner 
          - the set of common shapes are the uniquely identifiable combinations of these components (circle, square, triangle) that are not identifiable as simple transforms of other common shapes, but rather are composed of simple limit rules based on their core components (line, point, curve, corner) 
          - "enablement" doesnt perfectly capture "power", and the concept of "enablement" also relies on the concept of "power", but it does differentiate power from other concepts & unite its possible implementations & meanings 
          - "symmetry" doesnt perfectly capture "balance" 
          - "similarity" or "substitutability" or "identity" doesnt perfectly capture "equivalence" 
      - are uniquely identifiable compared to other concepts 
        - balance is related to symmetry so these are not unique concepts but embedded/dependent/overlapping/hierarchical concepts 
        - however balance is clearly differentiable from power, as balance inherently involves equivalence and power doesnt, whereas power inherently involves enablement and balance doesnt 
    - function to identify structures generating a concept or concepts generating a structure: 
      - example of finding a structure generating a concept:  
        - create a program that checks if a system is robust automatically, regardless of which system: what would a concept like 'robust' mean for a system? 
          - given the definition route to 'robust' as 'strong enough to withstand various circumstances', you can infer that if a system is robust, it can retain its structure despite application of various change types 
          - so query for change types in that system, then check which change types break the system & the ratio of (change types handled/total change types) 
          - assign a ratio to 'strong' adjective, then check if the change type handled ratio is above or below the strong ratio: if above, the system is 'robust' 
        - independence can be created with closed trade loops: the most basic example is where agent A produces everything agent B needs, and vice versa     
    - conceptual math functions: 
      - an example is applying the concept of 'meta' to the concept of 'game' and getting output of the operation like 'a game where games can be created by agents inside the game' or 'a game to design games', given similarities between attributes/functions of objects in the definition & relevant spaces 
      - apply one concept to another (apply 'power' to 'market' or 'evaluate market by power' involves standardizing the market concept in terms of power, using power as an interface) 
      - apply concept to a structure, as a priority 
    - function to evaluate conceptual change 
      - example of concept-based (power-based) change: 
        - as power (degree of dependency) changes, what else changes: 
          - previously distant points become equal to adjacent points as power increases 
          - value reverts a concept & the information of the value loses its meaning 
          - dimension space can be determined by the degree of dependency 
          - does a change increase or reduce power? 
        - this can be framed based on potential (bc power can change with respect to options), variance (because power can change with respect to change), and time (bc power can change over time) 
  - answers questions like: 
    - how to derive unique concepts & their relationships
    - how to derive output intents of concept combinations
    - how to fit concept combinations to structures
    - how to describe problem space, deriving strategies & perspectives in that space
    - what concepts cannot be reduced/abstracted further 
    - what concepts have which associated structures 
    - what definition routes identify a particular concept 
    - as change increases, how does a concept (like similarity) change 
    - concept-system interface:
      - what concepts are likely to evolve in a system
      - what concepts are common to most systems (would help identify concepts like an efficiency)

    - how to identify & use conceptual outputs
      - 'use truth to apply pressure'
      - 'express faith to motivate'

    - specific attribute analysis, of properties that descend from concepts & take form in a specific problem space: 
      - the power concept interface (has implementations that look like trust, info, etc) 
      - the balance concept interface (has implementations that look like symmetry, justice, etc) 

    - how to map core concepts to structures for use when building other concepts/objects
      - similar definition structures apply to similarly abstract concepts
      - change types (rule types like binding rules, boundary rules) can be used to generate different variations of a concept
        - power can be in the form of a connection hub (binding rules with an extreme value of the connection count attribute)
      - position is an important attribute in many abstract concepts (powerful position, power occupying the input position, position as an attribute of equivalence)
        - other core structural attributes can be used to generate the other concepts
      - concept definitions are useful so you can answer questions like these without translating them into structure yourself
        - is this system balanced/robust to change/have distributed power
        - what potential does this system have
        - what priorities does this system have
        - can this system impact many others (is it powerful)
        - does this system produce a conceptual attribute/object like trust/equality
        - what concepts (determining, generative, emergent, prioritized, optimized) do these systems have in common

    - how to derive unique objects in a system that cant be defined in terms of standard operations on other objects
      - example:
        - power cant be defined as a simple combination of other objects in the networks it participates in, because its an abstract property having many possible implementations, all having one thing in common, which is the role/behavior of "enabler/enabling", and power is therefore occupying more than one semantic layer, as it can be an object, role, function, input/output, depending on which structure is more relevant to the host system for this implementation of power
        - however, defining it in terms of these possible structures it occupies (input, role, function) is too simplistic - for example you cant define power as simply "an input" because while that is true, given its enabling functionality, it leaves out a lot of information and fails to distinguish it from other inputs, which may not be powerful since they are common or easily substituted with alternatives
        - even defining power by its core unifying function "enabling" is too simplistic because often power does more than just enable something, given the connectedness of systems - meaning that enable one thing often disables another thing in the system or an adjacent system, which creates effects other than enabling, as the disabled process may disable the original enabled process down the causal path

  - examples:

    - concept analysis in design of sorting function:

      - similarity in navigation, equality in split => optimal for target value near initial split points or similar positions to the split points
      - assumed difference embedded in pre-computation of attributes => optimal for target value with different pre-computed attribute value, or target values in similar position to values with different pre-computed attribute values or adjacent values

    - Conceptual Computer (Interface network)

      - look for mapping between the interface network and quantum particles
        
        - if this exists, its possible the interface network or its component units (like units of cause, units of probability, units of information, units of change, units of time) are stored in each superposition/quantum particle network, so that you can derive it at any point if you have the tools to measure it
        - however, by its nature, it may be designed to be unmeasurable - so youd have to use derivation methods to estimate its structure
        - this implies the structure of the interface network may also be changeable within the system implementing it
        - are the superpositions chaotic because theyre the interface where chaos leaks in from other universes?
        - if universes attract other universes by order/chaos, we would need to anticipate the impending adjacency to universes that need the order given by interface network understanding the most
        - interface network manipulation should be the next target once its current structure is understood
        - you would need to be prepared to handle unknowable system problem-solving (problem-solving in the absence of measurement tools/minimum of information to solve)
        - also maximizing the variance in this universe would attract refugees from other spaces chased out by the gravity of certainty, so they can take shelter in our variance - being the variance-generator would also allow us access to other universes as sources of error information
        
    - Solvability

        - examine shape of universe nexus by which problems are solvable & which are not
        - unsolvable problems are dependent on a conclusion that is not constructable with known information or functions
        - for the most part, unsolvable problems related to objects that are not understood or not based in our universe, 
        - so we only see their impact on other objects as they cascade into our perceivable universe or theorize their construction by processes we can perceive
        - common types of problems usually considered unsolvable:
          - computationally expensive but not impossible (information-dense, like how many particles are in the universe or how many prime numbers there are)
          - imperceptible relationship/object considered impossible to verify (what is the structure of other universes' nexuses)
          - conceptual relationships not mapped to math operations
        - just like the uncertainty vs. certainty pattern, there are patterns in the minimum information required for certainty (guaranteed that it can be known) & patterns in the minimum information required for uncertainty (guaranteed that it cant be known)

    - Time

      - does a concept like 'time' have inherent meaning?

        - its a structure used to sync change types, to frame changes in sequential relation to other changes
          - what is sequence in terms of importance?
            - sequence is determined by structure & initial position state - once you know those, you know which operations will occur in what sequence
          - so 'does sequence have meaning, compared to structure & initial position state info' is the question here
          - initial position state info is useful, but you can derive it with just the structure & a testing function to acquire information
          - the structure (generative structure) can be derived from the initial position state info (structure content) & the sequence (or other descriptive structures)
          - which is more important:
            - the initial state info
            - the generative structure
            - the structures that determine trajectory within the structure (like sequence)
          - it depends on intent, which in this case is to find the structure that explains the most & most relevant changes (a definition route of meaning) - which could be:
            - the structure where most change occurs
            - the structure where important (in the form of explanatory, descriptive, generative) changes occur, which enable adjacent derivation of the other relevant structures
            - the structure where change types develop & interact (change interface)
          - if the intent is to 'find sequential position of change types', time has meaning as a base, for the change types in question (conceptual time, standard time, change time)

        - in the sense of time as a synchronizing standard for change types, time has more meaning as a network of those change types than a standard applied as a directed dimension of change
          - yes, y is based on x, but how unexpected is that given existing information? is that the strict definition of change, or just expectation fulfillment given the inevitability of that connection based on the host structure & its rules? does the 'y based on x' relationship indicate anything about the structure or its rules that we didnt know? 
            - yes, attributes gather into types, but is this connection a new way of doing so, indicating the development of a new change type, or is it expected given the other information, in which case the strict definition of time has not occurred?
            - if it cannot be calculated with existing information, it can be framed as a concept describing a gap (its initial definition is 'not something else' or a 'lack of information' or 'another related concept + randomness') until it resolves into a structure
        
      - if nothing changes from what existing information allows derivation of, time cannot be said to occur 
        - another stricter definition route of time is 'change that cannot be described/generated with existing information', which connects it to the conceptss of randomness (equally likely change, lack of information) & potential (potential for change), leading to another definition route for time as 'potential information' or 'structures such as positions where certainty can develop'

      - its possible to derive the great filter (with every permutation of its output in every possible interface object combination)
        - can you shine the light of time in reverse, to highlight what is right behind the filter
        - are tools output by the filter capable of reaching beyond the light's domain
        - if the light generated by time is information, it won't be behind the filter unless theres another universe being used as the filter
        - is there a way to un-hardcode (unknow) a molecule to switch it to a dark 'stem cell' version of a molecule, where its identity & potential are not known 
          - is this the same thing as finding a way to set them free?
        - does time have density & communication effects like molecules, so that time accreted in a group is likelier to attract/repel more time, or that the time molecules in that group cant be unknown & converted back into potential?
        - is the interface network just after the filter, the filter itself, behind/before the filter, or emerging from shining some form of light into the filter
        - is there a leak in the filter's openings for variance to get in or is the variance part of the expected output

      - one reason time particles & potential particles are related is because time represents potential - if there's no potential for change (variance), time cannot pass
        - https://twitter.com/remixerator/status/1082066543788216320
        - this is one reason its important to determine other possible universes before our variance runs out - if we waste all our time/potential confirming/checking the information & entanglement connections in every particle, we wont be ready for the next universe once we're ejected from this one because we used up all the variance in this one
        - the universe chains/trajectories should be predictable if theres a correlation in variables - if the next universe has more variables creating more complexity or less potential or less information, that would increase the level of difficulty in preserving variance
        - otherwise if we preserve all the variance in this one, we'll attract the excess energy from other universes that collapsed into certainty, where the excess variance has to go somewhere and it will probably be routed to any universe where variance is handled in a relatively stable way
        - so its important to use any remaining variance to preserve variance in this universe, until we determine a universe that is more optimal to go to & a way to get there or bring it here
        - any leftover variance after that calculation can be used to reduce variance in knowable systems (solve problems)
        - this means not collapsing all superpositions into a certain state, which is a danger of quantum physics in addition to accidental or intentional entangled pair chain triggers
        - the direction of cause from observer to superposition state can probably be reversed, which is a key to solving some time travel problems in addition to alternative time shapes (conceptual time, time loops)

      - time can be defined as:
        - how many systems are capable of interacting on the same interface layer & the trajectory across the manifold of possible interaction combinations of those systems
          - whether other layers of interaction are system-adjacent (possible) or whether interface physics prohibits interactions on those layers for this system interaction trajectory (timeline)
        - if a variable changes with time (possible variance), that doesnt mean time (possible variance) caused its variance, 
          but the system collisions enabling the set of interactions possible in that layer
        - the flow of system molecules follows a physics that should be able to explain system change rules
        - the key question is: what is the system (set of core functions) that could generate the set of possible systems we assume exist, 
          and what host system could enable these core functions to result in combinations explaining those systems?
        - what is the host system in which system molecules exist? its modelable as a network with different states (structural math layer) in a particular interface (core dimension set)
        - what is the path between the math layer & the others that allows the math layer to contain its own internal rules and also capture all other rules?
          - the math layer is so important bc its the rules of value & structure, & it's relevant when we can observe/measure other systems to the point of being able to assign value & structure
          - systems that cannot be measured can be guessed but not proven, unless the set of proofs leaves only one possibility for that system's position
          - if there is only one possibility left to the question that explains the variance in this universe, then time doesnt exist in this universe
          - the point wouldnt be to predict future behavior, but to derive source rules of the universe
            & then optimize them for a universe where time could exist (every question cannot be answered in that universe)
            & then detail the steps necessary to trace that universe to this one
          - if there is a universe where every question can be answered, it might poison adjacent universes with its certainty, so they might pool their variance to introduce chaos to that one
            if there are remaining problems to solve in those other universes (systems with non-determinable winners using info available inside the universe, in that state)
          - information has to leak to preserve variance in this system
        - when you standardize the other layers to the position interface, it can be captured in the math layer
        - what is the causal relationship between these layers? does math cascade into the others or just capture their structure, once it decays into information?
        - math is the unit system in the system layer, just like information is the unit object in the conceptual layer (unit/key object: out of which all other objects are built)

      - where does time get expanded in a distorted way when expanded to the fourth dimension after being compressed into the 3rd, like 2d representations of a sphere get expanded in a distorted way?

      - example of a different conceptual system:
        - if power favored centralization, another core concept like balance would have to favor a chaotic process or not exist at all, or another core concept would need to be added to the network

      - time involves meaning attached to order, where order is a fundamental base to frame changes on, and when order is reversed/removed, different rules apply
          - this may indicate that particles have a 'probable next state' or 'probable change type/rate' stored with them, given their motion, and reversal of order, when combined with other reversals on other interfaces, doesnt erase this information right away, so different prior states can be generated - if a particle is isolated from its motion by adding potential/uncertainty, other rules may apply
          - the range of possible orders can be generated, and the set can be filtered by various rule sets to generate the set of probable orders, so order may not be capable of capturing all information
          - what about position/distance, set, space or other structural bases for change?
          - does order only matter if its order is synchronized with other ordered processes, generating loss of potential from dependence between synchronized processes
          - time can be framed as independence, and where dependence crystallizes into a measurable rule, time/potential are not possible
          - 4-d time as typically represented is an illusion of time, capturing a prior rule/moment - these isolated dependency rules are unlikely to build time without the independence of understanding, which can generate the rules & add potential as needed - each prior rule can be used to build time/understanding/independence but some prior rules are likelier than others, and abstract rules are likeliest

        - order-dependent processes can be modeled in time-based spaces
          - in order for liquid to be irreversibly dispersed according to the time symmetry, the liquid has to be in the cup 
          - change according to time-adjacent variables (potential, change) can be modeled rather than time, to increasingly remove the meaning of order/prior position, as certain change types make more or all positions possible, whereas theres no point in euclidean space representing 3-d space that can jump to any other with the same effort as an adjacence space - movement has cost in 3-d euclidean space
          - removing more conditions of time (order, irreversibility, possibility, measurability) would eventually lead to the symmetric state where functions producing change would be equivalent to/generative of each other (the theoretical liquid can generate the theoretical cup in that space if it needs to, injecting more time/potential in a prior position on its timeline to further current goals (based on change potential - the set of possible moves given by its current position), which require less change/time/potential than anticipated)
          - reverse time to a prior state:
            - maintain potential:
              - dont execute a decision change until needed: allow potential to maintain its superposition (not resolved to a certain structure/path/point) so when you need to, you can choose an aligning path from that potential that fits the post-selection trajectory
            - add potential as needed: 
              - remove traces of resolution into a choice by undoing the root cause up the causal stack (like removing an attribute can restore an object to an undifferentiated type)
              - add variance-handlers to restore potential lost bc of change cascades that take up time (buy more time by handling current & anticipating imminent change)
              - remove limits (movement, information, boundaries, rules, structure, attributes) to enable new combinations
              - acquire power (understanding) which is a proxy for potential (range of alternative options)
              - remove filter determining loss of potential/change by mapping that filter to another one
              - create efficiencies (shortcuts) to allow existing objects to interact in new ways 
                - change definition of distance so all combinations are possible and adjacent to remove time cost to travel to them
              - change faster than other changes so other changes could never catch up without your change methods, which youve left information out of so they'd all need to be used together to build your change rate from a different trajectory
            - alter dimension to avoid reducing potential directly
              - frame change in dimension that collapses to potential in its default low-cost state
              - change in other dimensions that dont impact 3-d space, but which are collapsible or transferable into 3-d space as needed
                - host changes external to or beyond measurement/prediction potential (host on interface that doesnt register the change so time cannot be said to have passed)
            - organize potential so it can survive or increase
              - chain superpositions so that collapsing one can cause a collapse of another out of reach bc its in a prior time
              - map all positions/interfaces in prior state to current state to remove time that has passed since then

    - meaning (Relevance/Structure)

      - meaning comes from attributes like:
        - reduction of signals (relevance)
        - matching of signal structures (similarity)

    - entropy/variance

        - the reason entropy can evolve on its own is that if order was the default, it wouldnt allow order (in the form of alignments) to be constructed for a particular efficient purpose (like making a trade or cooperating) and then automatically deconstructed by entropy when no longer used. Efficiencies may be rare & temporary enough that order shouldnt be the default so disorder can allow more interactions to occur and more efficiencies can be found naturally. It's similar to the free market allowing companies to organize & operate without regulation to find efficiencies in demand/supply.

            - visualizing equivalence across definitions & types:
              - if you can standard objects to attribute sets, you can visualize as a graph of attribute sets where shapes map to attribute sets and visible or highlighted shape attributes are equivalent
              - you need to incorporate objects like conditions & definitions as system/space attributes
