- ui

  - example of UI for implementing intent-matching for code generation
    - form accepting intent queries like 'build streaming platform optimizing for metric c with these data sources'
    - user input can be a diagram of an optimal structure to generate:
      - upload a diagram positioning data sources, formatting/aggregation/analysis processes, metrics, query types, permissions, visuals, & target output, which produces various implementation diagrams the program derives, which the user selects between
        - including attributes/functions like:
          - which data should be streamed where
          - which data should be encrypted in what way
          - which actions should follow which actions
          - which data should be accessible by api, to which apps
          - which queries are expected, from which users/apps
    - identify uncertainties like config relevant to their intent and ask questions to confirm to reduce produced set of implementation diagrams
