Strategies for ending poverty in a cost-minimizing way that mostly involves combining/arranging existing resources in an adjacent way (which will make the whole world happy & free from negative feelings like fear/guilt/horror, to overthrow the government of feelings):

    giving poor people the information advantages they can use (a cell phone, internet) to lift themselves into a higher income, to fight corrupt officials, gangs, & other exploiters, & correct the lack of information about where to find resources like water/medicine/internships, which skills they can acquire in online tutorials that would earn them a local job, or lack of information to organize their labor with people who aren't in shouting distance
    applying optimization algorithms to arrange resources like information/problems/advantages/costs/agents/roles/markets/trades/regulations
        training optimization algorithms to optimize market/law/resource/process state networks for fair/earned resource distribution or exploit minimization or labor/problem distribution (after standardizing to cost/benefit, incentives/intents/priorities, potential measured as alternative option increase/reduction ratio, problems/opportunities/efficiencies/debt/competition/information created/used/wasted, stakes/risks, potential/probable/current value by location/job/time/state, and input work & earned/received output objects, and aiming for a metric like benefit/cost ratio or problem/resource ratio distribution)
        identifying which tools would improve state the most efficiently (answering questions like 'is distributing a water-filtering straw to everyone, organizing/optimizing water supply chains, or moving everyone to cities the best way to distribute clean water to everyone, and in which areas are these strategies optimal, given other problems/solutions being applied') 
        staggering the education of skills to people in a sequence/distribution/combination that would make that information valuable to their local markets temporarily so they can earn enough to get other jobs
        applying optimization algorithms to predict/optimize integrations of local solutions to predict how theyll interact with other problems/solutions at scale, like what would happen if one recycling program is implemented with a water supply chain and communications technology, in combination with a different set of rules/enforcement/incentives/etc in the next neighborhood, and so on, at a national/global level - which is a problem of predicting change interactions (problem/solution interactions) that most people cant predict without extreme computation resources
    distributing independence-generating tools (robots, machine-building resources, cell phone/internet, security tools, statistics knowledge, skills (communication, comedy, social, technical, math, logical), accurate information about markets/govt/medicine, product & information quality testing tools, etc)
    attacking the exploiters ruining the world, either by informing them to reduce their incentive to exploit, or by correcting whatever imbalance they have that makes them want to exploit other people (if they have a lack of love, teach them the structural definition of love (choosing to see someone's potential, aligning your feelings with someone, maintaining a ratio of positive memories with someone) or teach them social/communication skills or supply them with sex drive-decreasing medicine, & how to earn love - if they have a lack of money, teach them how to earn it - if they have greed/lack of self-control, teach them how to be humble & why it's good) - if they don't respond to altruistic motives, show them how even selfish motives are fulfilled by exploiting people less, such as that they wont be attacked as much or asked to do charity
    sharing the information that there are options other than not thinking at all & other possibilities than just existing structure like feelings, such as learning/thinking & interfaces like logic, and that these things increase one's potential & uniqueness & contributions to the future
    sharing the information that only unattractive/unloved/stupid people act in selfish ways, and loved/smart people are altruistic
    making this set of information required viewing for attaining other resources, like permissions to view other content or use an app or get a job
    distributing resource-producing resources (like probiotic colonies to create a probiotic supply that can be grown to produce medicine for a community, or mosquitos with vaccines in their saliva)
    allocate unused resources to poor people (mostly info-gathering, logistics, & shipping costs, and marketing to get all people to give info about what they can donate
    identify adjacent-resource (skill/info) investments that poor people could work on or contribute to that would create a profit
        cleaning up environment
        producing essential supplies like medicine on their own from local resources (once they have info like instructions & resource position, since medicines & other resources can usually be generated from many different resource combinations)
        executing instructions for building medicines/essential hard-to-get supplies from local resources
        developing/optimizing simple components of more complicated systems (like extracting insights from a research paper, or finding natural processes that do a bio system optimization more efficiently, or checking research studies for best practices, verifying predictions of AI models or other prediction methods, answering questions to train AI, operating drones/robots picking up trash or assembling goods or planting trees, monitoring for alert types, documenting error/problem types/quantity/cause, surveying to gather data (solving information-imbalance problems, such as information about current problems), other monitoring/enforcement tasks like compliance-assessment)
        teaching them analysis methods so they can contribute to solving other information problems (identifying causal variables, reporting exploit opportunities & other manual interface & system analysis that helps optimize systems, such as their water pipelines or recycling programs)
        teaching them how to do simple, delegatable pieces (like summarizing a meeting, comparing summary algorithm output & manually selecting the best summary to train new algorithms to automate simple job component tasks, writing emails, executing/monitoring/rolling back builds, testing sites/features/apps for errors or exploits, identifying/attacking hacker groups, making decisions about legitimate/illegitimate requests/processes once an AI identifies possible intruders, testing pipelines, translating task descriptions into automatable structures like templates, identifying/resolving social conflicts, designing arguments, identifying/evaluating bias, applying a language perspective like diplomatic language to translations/communications, mapping a language to a standardized language, mapping systems to other systems like math rules/objects to language rules/objects, identifying patterns like fake news/joke/summary/insight patterns, persuading voters, identifying system optimization opportunities which can then be filtered by automated logic like filtering which opportunities are lowest-cost, identifying fake news, fact-checking, interviews) of existing complex jobs (devops, coding, legal analysis) so the current employees can learn other complex skills (data science, math, optimization algorithms)
        doing the work that would reduce poverty themselves as their job (learning & teaching other poor people skills, delivering donated goods to other poor people), since reducing poverty is an investment that would pay dividends by creating a new population of contributing scientists/laborers and reduce health care/charity/climate costs
