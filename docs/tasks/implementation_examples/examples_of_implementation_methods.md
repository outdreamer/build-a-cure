- examples of other implementation methods than documented default methods (like the 'apply/find/build/derive' function set)

- how to implement the interface analysis framework as a set of simple functions for an initial version, involving alternate default constant simple structures to combine, such as:
    - symmetry structures applied as a default variable structure, rather than 'incremental change combinations', so that by default, symmetry combinations are sought, rather than incremental change combinations, to always frame change in terms of symmetries
    - combinations of useful intents (such as those that are relevant/realistic) as a default interface to base changes on, finding the functions to fulfill them at query time, as implementation variables
    - structures of relevant cross-interface structures as a default structure to apply changes to
        - for example, 'patterns of causal structures of structures of structures' (like the patterns of cause of 'a sequence of structures that develops from another structure')
	- functions that act like useful filters of relevant information, such as:
	    - a function that can determine an attribute like 'change type' that reveals similarity/difference of a relevant structure like 'output change type'
	- applying specific interface structures as a default constant set
		- applying information rules of reality such as 'truths become false when over-depended on, beyond their appropriate context or meaning'
		- applying interim connecting structures of useful structures representing the truth like 'rules databases', 'attribute networks', etc, such as 'common structures to both systems' such as 'constant attribute rules' (variable interaction rules)
		- applying useful reality representation structures such as 'metaphors (similar/relevant but different/inaccurate structures to format something differently in a useful way to achieve understanding)'
		- applying physics rules such as the 'fuzziness of physical reality' as a way to find other true structures ('symmetries', 'alternative definitions', 'patterns')
		- applying structures like the functions that can generate the highest variation (such as the 'Conway game of life') as a default structure to generate other high-variation structures like reality
		- applying specific mappings across interface structures (like concepts such as 'balance', physics structures like 'symmetry', and physical reality structures such as information agent structures such as 'justice' and 'economic equilibrium', or concepts like 'interface', structures like 'bases', information structures like 'metaphors' being variable implementations of the 'interface' concept) as default structures (such as default inputs of a neural network used to predict other mappings)
		- apply useful perspective structures (like combinations of perspectives such as the 'optimization perspective' and the 'religious perspective' to efficiently describe other useful structures like 'what agents want and what could be true using adjacent transforms of reality') as a default constant set
		- apply useful structure sets that should go together (like how 'dependence' is useful in the 'causal' interface but negative in the 'physical reality' interface)
		- apply useful structures (like 'direction or line connecting starting/goal points' and 'implementation structures to get to that point') to model useful structures that are useful when applied together, like 'intents/implementations of intents', as a useful input to neural networks to fulfill the task of 'adjacently combining them in a way that connects them'
		    - similarly apply patterns of implementation structures such as 'causal loops referencing nested sub-problems resolved with some structure and output to the host structure once solved' as default components of implementations of intents
		- fulfill a primary function of a particular interface that can solve most problems, such as 'evaluate meaning', and the useful functions to fulfill that function efficiently
		- apply structures iteratively to calculate the global/universal meaning to check if its obviously false at scale (in its extreme form which is more easily determined), such as applying a rule like 'its ok to violate someones rights if theyre a genius and youre fascinated by them' (after iterating to an extreme scale, its obvious that no, that couldnt be right, then geniuses wouldnt want to live if that rule is applied at scale, to guarantee that geniuses' rights will always be violated, and it couldnt be right for many other reasons, such as it is probably 'better/more sustainable/and therefore lower cost' to prioritize turning people into geniuses than to persecute geniuses with rights violations which will reduce our supply of geniuses to zero)
			- structures that make other structures obvious are obviously useful
		    - apply interactions of known structures at scale as default filters of other scaled structures, determining what else can exist at that scale, deriving core structures of truth from these scaled structures that could also exist at that scale
		- apply structures that can be used for multiple intents as default useful structures bc they can handle more variation than other structures and are therefore likelier to be compoundingly useful when applied in structures like combinations
		- apply structures that can offset neural network inadequacies such as 'limits of a series' being useful for solving the problem of modeling 'longer sequences of input/output connections' as a tool to determine when a sequence might converge, which is obviously useful for prediction intents, as well as other structures that allow the user to 'see far ahead', such as 'highly complex/different realistic/stable/efficient' structures, useful determining functions of extreme attribute similarities/differences (like absolute change type interactions, such as preserved change types when some function is applied) as 'extreme' structures and 'equivalent alternate structures (that can keep each other in check and identify invalid structures)', and other structures that allow you to efficiently calculate a lot from a little information
		    - you can see how useful functions (like calculating an adjacent attribute such as 'constance/addition' that reveals non-adjacent information like information about 'extreme change type preservation') act like a powerful information filter that reveals information that is difficult to calculate (non-adjacent)
		    - finding useful structures to determine attributes of other useful structures (useful structures like 'extremes') can be done by reverse-engineering 'input problem cases' where these revelatory 'filter' structures would be useful:
		        - finding highly different structures like extremes or complex manifolds (high-variation change based on an interface like a connected structure such as a manifold, which is a useful math structure adjacently mapped/corresponding to an interface)
		        - determining what is easily determined about that highly different structure once you know it
		        - determining what cases this information could be useful in
		        - determining whether those cases are useful
		    - similarly apply functions to 'calculate convexity' and 'filter possible functions given maximal differences (structurally similar change types that can look similar at first like exponential change, waves, hyperbolic functions, etc but which have adjacent filters to filter them out) detected by some point' as a way of improving 'gradient descent errors'
		    	- you can see how these 'structural similarities' (like an 'exponentially increasing subset') provide a useful constant base to apply changes to, to determine other possible structures and identify filters of those possible structures
		    	- this is an embedded application of the 'interface' concept, which is clear in the usefulness of this 'similarity to base changes on'
		- apply interaction levels ('adjacently connectible structures that interact/connect') as 'input information' or an 'information format' to neural networks (which fulfill the task of 'finding adjacent combinations to connect variables')
	- applying more adjacently determinable structures as an input
	    - attribute networks as an input and function networks as an output implementing those attribute networks
	- finding an 'input-output sequence' that would be useful and would probably be adjacently constructible in that sequence
	    - like a sequence of first building an 'attribute network' to describe all variables and then building a 'function network' describing that network and then a 'function generator network' to compress/generate that function network
	- applying default interface structures as the core functions of a machine learning network so that errors like 'not understanding abstract concepts' can be avoided by injecting abstract concepts as a default input or function or related structure, so that 'combinations of abstract concepts' required to 'solve a problem of understanding some conceptual combination' are adjacent
	- finding all high-variation variables/functions and applying that as a base to describe other high-variation variables/functions
	- apply optimization interaction structures (like a 'set of game strategies that can result in a tie') as being useful structures to model other useful structures like 'interchangeable equivalent alternates'
	- apply the 'biggest differences in between known problems/solutions' as a set of useful differences to apply to model other differences which are likely to be more connectible than those differences
	- apply combinations of workflows to find other workflows, to find solution-finding methods
	- apply structures guaranteed to be relevant (like 'changes within x causal degrees') as a default set of structures likely to be useful in solving a problem, then apply other useful structures like 'combinations/input-output sequences' to those structures to find the useful set of structures to solve the problem
	- apply a sequence of these other implementation methods as a way of designing a path from mvp to final product
    - apply useful structures that are more adjacent to solutions than problems are, such as a structure including 'interactive structures' and 'useful descriptions of the problem'
        - the better explained a problem is with the best representation of it, the easier it is to solve it
    - finding structures that represent the most interface structures (like a 'high variation structure that represents various core interface structures like interactions and requirements and generative functions')
    - finding structures that describe most problems/solutions in terms of interface structures such as 'a breaking of an interface' or 'misrouting of randomness' or a 'structure of resolution between ambiguous alternates' and other useful interface descriptions of useful structures, so these can be re-applied or applied as defaults or core structures
    - similar to how solving a maze can involve applying these structures, as 'equivalent alternate' structures that can provide the same or similarly useful information in solving the maze, deriving other useful possible solutions is possible by applying useful concepts like 'incentives' (to derive basic structures likely to occur)
       - applying regular 'direction of motion' checks to make sure the agent is still traveling toward the goal and not repeating routes
       - applying standard maze configurations as possible alternatives to select from
       - solving for standard tricks to check for in a maze that are incentivized and therefore likely to be encountered, and solving for the solutions to those tricks
       - solving for interactive sequences of paths that coordinate/cancel each other and can/cannot exist in the same maze
       - solving for 'maximal filters' that can filter out possible mazes the most efficiently
       - apply reverse-engineering to find indicators of various possible sequences of end paths nearest the exit
       - these structures involve solving other problems than 'apply any route using trial & error as a base solution, and change it as you go' which is a default solution to solving a maze
       - solving problems like mazes is a proxy for solving other problems bc of the high variation captured in a maze, if the maze reflects realistic randomness and other variable interaction patterns enough, similar to solving other games if they reflect realistic structures enough
    - a set of useful descriptions of reality that have reasons why they could be true (like a 'calculator of efficient methods of preserving energy cycles' and a 'structure to support maximal variation/uncertainty (time)' and a 'stable alternate coexisting sequence (time) finder') are useful to apply as defaults and efficient structures and truth structures, as well as the variables creating uncertainties (like 'unknown beneficiaries of calculations' and the 'maximally different structure' and the 'most stable system that supports the most variation') in these descriptions and the variables between them (such as interface structures like different priorities), as well as the differences between the description and related structures like 'problems solved with that description' and 'priorities fulfilled by that description' which make the meaning and reality of each description more calculatable
    - apply useful structures like 'clarifying structures' which make something obvious similar to how certain filters make some solutions obvious such as 'standardizing' and 'difference-maximizing' filters make differences more obvious
