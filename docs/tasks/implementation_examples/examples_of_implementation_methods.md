- examples of other implementation methods than documented methods (like the 'apply/find/build/derive' function set)

- how to implement the interface analysis framework as a set of simple functions for an initial version, involving alternate default constant simple structures to combine, such as:
    - symmetry structures applied as a default variable structure, rather than 'incremental change combinations', so that by default, symmetry combinations are sought, rather than incremental change combinations, to always frame change in terms of symmetries
    - combinations of useful intents (such as those that are relevant/realistic) as a default interface to base changes on, finding the functions to fulfill them at query time, as implementation variables
    - structures of relevant cross-interface structures as a default structure to apply changes to
        - for example, 'patterns of causal structures of structures of structures' (like the patterns of cause of 'a sequence of structures that develops from another structure')
	- functions that act like useful filters of relevant information, such as:
	    - a function that can determine an attribute like 'change type' that reveals similarity/difference of a relevant structure like 'output change type'
	- applying specific interface structures as a default constant set
		- applying information rules of reality such as 'truths become false when over-depended on, beyond their appropriate context or meaning'
		- applying interim connecting structures of useful structures representing the truth like 'rules databases', 'attribute networks', etc, such as 'common structures to both systems' such as 'constant attribute rules' (variable interaction rules)
		- applying useful reality representation structures such as 'metaphors (similar/relevant but different/inaccurate structures to format something differently in a useful way to achieve understanding)'
		- applying physics rules such as the 'fuzziness of physical reality' as a way to find other true structures ('symmetries', 'alternative definitions', 'patterns')
		- applying structures like the functions that can generate the highest variation (such as the 'game of life') as a default structure to generate other high-variation structures like reality
		- applying specific mappings across interface structures (like concepts such as 'balance', physics structures like 'symmetry', and physical reality structures such as information agent structures such as 'justice' and 'economic equilibrium') as default structures (such as default inputs of a neural network used to predict other mappings)
		- apply useful perspective structures (like combinations of perspectives such as the 'optimization perspective' and the 'religious perspective' to efficiently describe other useful structures like 'what agents want and what could be true using adjacent transforms of reality') as a default constant set
		- apply useful structure sets that should go together (like how 'dependence' is useful in the 'causal' interface but negative in the 'physical reality' interface)
		- apply useful structures (like 'direction or line connecting starting/goal points' and 'implementation structures to get to that point') to model useful structures that are useful when applied together, like 'intents/implementations of intents', as a useful input to neural networks to fulfill the task of 'adjacently combining them in a way that connects them'
		    - similarly apply patterns of implementation structures such as 'causal loops referencing nested sub-problems resolved with some structure and output to the host structure once solved' as default components of implementations of intents
		- apply structures iteratively to calculate the global/universal meaning to check if its obviously false at scale (in its extreme form which is more easily determined), such as applying a rule like 'its ok to violate someones rights if theyre a genius and youre fascinated by them' (after iterating, its obvious that no, that couldnt be right, then geniuses wouldnt want to live if that rule is applied at scale, to guarantee that geniuses' rights will always be violated, and it couldnt be right for many other reasons, such as it is probably 'better/more sustainable/and therefore lower cost' to prioritize turning people into geniuses than to persecute geniuses with rights violations which will reduce our supply of geniuses to zero)
		    - apply interactions of known structures at scale as default filters of other scaled structures, determining what else can exist at that scale, deriving core structures of truth from these scaled structures that could also exist at that scale
		- apply structures that can be used for multiple intents as default useful structures bc they can handle more variation than other structures and are therefore likelier to be compoundingly useful when applied in structures like combinations
		- apply structures that can offset neural network inadequacies such as 'limits of a series' being useful for solving the problem of modeling 'longer sequences of input/output connections' as a tool to determine when a sequence might converge, which is obviously useful for prediction intents, as well as other structures that allow the user to 'see far ahead', such as 'highly complex/different realistic/stable/efficient' structures, useful determining functions of extreme attribute similarities/differences (like absolute change type interactions such as preserved change types when some function is applied) as 'extreme' structures and 'equivalent alternate structures (that can keep each other in check and identify invalid structures)', and other structures that allow you to efficiently calculate a lot from a little information
		- apply interaction levels ('adjacently connectible structures that interact/connect') as 'input information' or an 'information format' to neural networks (which fulfill the task of 'finding adjacent combinations to connect variables')
	- applying more adjacently determinable structures as an input
	    - attribute networks as an input and function networks as an output implementing those attribute networks
	- finding an 'input-output sequence' that would be useful and would probably be adjacently constructible in that sequence
	    - like a sequence of first building an 'attribute network' to describe all variables and then building a 'function network' describing that network and then a 'function generator network' to compress/generate that function network
	- applying default interface structures as the core functions of a machine learning network so that errors like 'not understanding abstract concepts' can be avoided by injecting abstract concepts as a default input or function or related structure, so that 'combinations of abstract concepts' required to 'solve a problem of understanding some conceptual combination' are adjacent
	- finding all high-variation variables/functions and applying that as a base to describe other high-variation variables/functions
	- apply optimization interaction structures (like a 'set of game strategies that can result in a tie') as being useful structures to model other useful structures like 'interchangeable equivalent alternates'
	- apply the 'biggest differences in between known problems/solutions' as a set of useful differences to apply to model other differences which are likely to be more connectible than those differences
	- apply combinations of workflows to find other workflows, to find solution-finding methods
	- apply structures guaranteed to be relevant (like 'changes within x causal degrees') as a default set of structures likely to be useful in solving a problem, then apply other useful structures like 'combinations/input-output sequences' to those structures to find the useful set of structures to solve the problem
