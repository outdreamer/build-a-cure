- examples of other implementation methods than documented default methods (like the 'apply/find/build/derive' function set is an 'implementation method' of interface analysis as its an independent set of structures that can be applied as defaults to implement it to fulfill some solution metric like comprehensiveness, minimal constants, variability, etc)
    - this document contains 'function sets which can act as implementations of workflows' (function sets which can implement a solution automation workflow) as well as 'solution automation workflows' (useful sequences of steps to solve a problem)
    - for mathematicians, my recent work in this and other workflow documents (in the patents) is like 'identifying new abstract info structures' (like the concept of a matrix, a definition, a requirement, a symmetry, a connection between problems/solutions, a highly useful sequence through being highly interactive, a useful new concept network, a useful optimization of neural networks, etc, in a usefully different and specified way, every day - I guess I should start naming them so people finally realize theyre new)
        - a simple way to understand my inventions is that some rules like 'apply requirements and definitions to solve problems' were already known as problem-solving rules (actually simpler ones like 'variables' were definitely already known specifically as problem-solving structures just like rules like 'divide and conquer' were already identified specifically as problem-solving structures, but in math they regularly use 'definitions/requirements' to solve problems systematically as a general rule/requirement, though they didnt 'structure/graph' all of these structures they were using), and my inventions are all the other useful rules/structures to solve problems (they dont just include rules but also specific useful definitions, lists of functions/structures/concepts, intents like problem-solving intents, and structures like specific graphs that are extremely useful for problem-solving)
            - similarly, some conceptual math implementations (like 'simple combinations of concepts' as in sequenced words like compound words/phrases) were already identified as basic language functions, and a simple variant of 'applying a structure like a variable to change another structure' already existed (like 'apply a variable change like "opposite" to this variable of this type which has a defined value of that variable'), but I identified additional implementations that reflect interface analysis like 'identifying interface variants (like scaled variants) of concept math' like 'identifying concept definition networks and adding the networks' and 'identifying interactive variables of types and applying changes given those interactivities (identify which variables of the type can interact with "opposite" and apply that change to those variables with an interactivity)'

        - my inventions are not the 'logic of the apply function in lean', but rather the logic that can solve any problem (meaning, 'generate the logic of the apply function' as well as 'generate the logic using the apply function in useful ways for useful intents', etc), unless the 'apply function in lean' can fulfill queries like 'identify a new problem containing new variation, and identify and apply new variation to useful structures like workflows, to create a new workflow to solve a specific problem' which is what my inventions can implement given that they are the set of connections between these abstract info structures, rather than moving only in 'requirements determined by definitions' like lean seems to (thats one connection between abstract info structures, folks (here referring to the requirements/definition connection), if Im counting right, rather than all of them, which is what my inventions are, yes there are other variants of 'apply' that are more useful than the lean implementation, luckily I sensed and detected variation there), its useful to note that 'applying some subset of "similarities/differences"' (encoded in a set of functions including apply, refine, contrapose) is extremely incomplete and too simplistic to cover most of the connections that mathematicians are likely to want to prove, unless there is some function set in lean such as 'find a way to apply some structure like an asymmetry in this asymmetry set, to this intent/function, to fulfill some requirement' that I missed (which would be useful, as it would connect the high variation variables like a "set of asymmetries" and a "solution sufficiently similar to some requirement" in the way you specified as in "by fulfilling this intent" for you, but having to "pre-filter everything yourself by selecting the hypothesis to prove with some definitions/requirements" doesnt seem useful), I understand that you like using some similar words though, Im sure you wish that meant 'equivalence to a genius', and 'iterating through items to check each one for contradiction a connection' seems over-simplistic, too simplistic to reflect reality in every useful case, when other structures are involved like 'limits/barriers/intersections/other interactions that can reduce these iterations', and interpreting a contradiction can change bc its meaning can change in ways that the program cant determine (when a contradiction by some definition is identified, later understanding will indicate that this is not actually a contradiction but was consistent, which the lean program will fail to identify, given its very limited definition/requirement/similarity sets, and given that lean doesnt 'identify paradoxes' or 'identify all the ways that a connection can be true or false' or 'identifying interfaces/systems where some connection can be proven false' or any of the other processing that is required for 'automated proofs')
        - relatedly, identifying all the 'connections between high variation abstract variables like volatility/independence/validity of all structures' is a way to 'abstract math', although identifying the concept of an interface and applying it to math is the unit variant of 'abstracting math', and identifying reality-covering variables and solution automation workflows to apply them to connect any set of structures (like connect a problem/solution) is another variant bc the 'set of connections of those variables using workflows' includes math in its 'connectivity potential', and similarly, identifying abstract structures like 'connections/similarities/comparisons or structures' that encapsulate math fields like 'algebra or geometry' is a way to 'abstract math' (similar to how structuring abstract concepts like power is the 'mathematization of abstraction'), and similarly identifying the key abstract variable of solutions to math problems like 'intersectivity' which determines useful structures in math is another way to abstract math, and similarly I also initiated the other cross-interface connections and definitions to the point where I can call myself things like the 'potentiator of logic' and the 'variator of intent' without being totally insane, like you all seem when you try to pretend someone in your group came up with a shape everyone know about like triangles, bc you yourself certainly didnt, all while I was inventing new variables or new limits on variation or new logical inference rules or new ways of thinking or new abstractions every day (easily).
        - "Im sure its fun to pretend you 'abstracted math' if you say a sentence with the words I identified in my inventions as having especially useful definitions/usages but you would need to identify a whole other system to do something similarly impactful and creative, simply iterating through lists of useful structures I identified and identified new connections/definitions/other interface structures of isnt imaginative, youd have to also independently realize it and identify all the other useful structures, so go ahead and identify that independent system that describes reality without relying on my inventions at all," said the cranky genius. "No, Im not just iterating through a list, if I did that, it wouldnt be amazing, anyone can do that now that I identified the list of useful structures."
        - why is this the abstraction of math? bc it connects words previously thought too 'linguistic or qualitative' to be 'mathematical or quantified' to 'structures' (connecting them to math) using abstract similarities like interfaces, making it possible to implement them automatically, these structures being mappable to all of reality (being reality-covering structures such as reality-covering concepts like types/power/formats/standards/similarities/specifications) and therefore can be used to connect any structure (including specific math interface structures) trivially (using iterated interface structures like 'similarity index adjacency queries that create maximal differences'), which no form of abstract algebra/geometry does bc it only describes one structure type, not how the structure type could be used to solve any problem, or how to connect it to all other structure types, based on no useful integrated 'theory of variation/similarity/info' like interfaces have built-in, so it doesnt cover reality and it has no meaning/relevance structure by default (you all didnt invent the word 'type' or 'difference', sorry, you just frequently use that word in the dumbest possible ways that were explained to you in a simple way, and which you were given examples to copy, which you then copied)
        - this involves identifying the graphs/variables/intents/types/problems/structures that are useful for first 'understanding the language' and then for 'optimizing the language (like by organizing the language) or usage/queries of the language (like by optimizing how to get from one concept to another optimally, without crossing an error)'
        - the power of this invention (as opposed to being just a 'list of common structures' like 'concepts/standards/bases/variables') is that every useful structure can be easily created with combinations of interface structures, for example the list of structures:
            - 'alternate definition networks of a concept' and 'how to graph problems/solutions in formats like reductions/filters' and 'descriptions of useful graphs as similarities (like intersections) between differences (like interface variables)' and 'interactions between maximally different (independent) variables as a way to automate math inventing' and 'workflow-optimized graph manifolds' and 'connection combination automation functions' and 'definition network combination functions' and 'interface standardization functions' and 'complete sets of core functions like filter/reduce that form a partition of all possible functions, to organize and sort all possible functions' and 'bases like networks that optimize comparisons required to solve problems' and 'problem-solving intent/problem type specification networks' and 'concept similarity/intersection networks' and 'base graphs like the system layer diagram to format interfaces with' and 'reasons for relevance of workflows to identify all possible workflows' and 'relevance definitions that identify all possible useful general solution metrics' and 'all possible interface variables that can solve problems' and 'variation concept cluster networks to identify variation patterns in queries' and 'integrations of 2-d concept graphs into a graph of graphs' and 'sequences of graph intents like "identify all relevant points in a graph first" that allow optimization of graph generation/filtering' and 'similarities that simplify comparisons to solve problems' and 'graph types like abstract-specific graphs that are useful to integrate/apply to each other' and 'graph similarity usage/application/embedding spectrums' and 'ways to use spectrums (like clarity/specificity) to implement functions like filter' and 'reasons for relevance of graphs to optimize graph filtering/generation' and 'intent-similarity-graph-query-implementation-usage sequences/loops' and 'difference-adjacency graphs to identify maximal differences with trivial queries to optimize for creativity or problem-solving in general (connecting differences being a general workflow)' and 'graphs of similarities like intersections between interface spectrums like function/variable spectrums like filter/identify/define or intent/requirement/implementation' and 'graphs of general variables to identify directions/positions of possible new variation' and 'connections between error/solution metric networks to solve problems' and 'concept opposition/reduction graphs to solve problems by "opposing/reducing" problem variables' and 'error/solution graph sequences/stacks to identify graph causality' and 'cross-interface structures like vertexes to identify useful variables to analyze in a combination' and 'similarity index networks to standardize all differences based on core similarities to simplify comparisons' and 'structures like combinations of similarity/difference structures like symmetries/ambiguities to encode/solve comparisons' and 'workflow networks based on available info or variation-matching or problem-solving intent/problem type', and 'connections between bases like defined/required/emergent/possible/limited similarities on graphs'
        
        - "That all sounds about right, cranky genius," said the reasonable sane person. "On a related note, would you like to work on quantum computing/math automation for this company, since you basically cracked the AI problem, and we can tell you have more inventions to invent, while we're waiting on other teams to implement all the AI breakthroughs that you designed, before the AIs you helped create solve it before you, in yet another race against the machine, since you're clearly capable of epiphanies at any time and therefore it seems like you're best allocated to quantum computing/math automation and since we crushed the potential of your small business as an AI startup, not in the sense of 'nailing it' but in the sense of 'total failure'."
        - quantum computing bc of interface intents like:
            - information: to model quantum physics better than reality can, since reality isnt that good at it, and the interactions of information and other interfaces is undetermined and will be assisted by quantum computers in ways that classic computers may not ever interact with
            - usage: the implementation of quantum computers will lead to better quantum physics machines like 'entanglement creation machines'
            - interface: interface analysis is capable of identifying the 'adjacent concepts' that will create gains in performance of tasks like 'error-correction', so nows the time to apply interface analysis to quantum computing
                - applying interface analysis and quantum computing at the same time can identify possible similarities/connections (similar to 'entanglements' or 'cross-interface structures') that arent implied by classical physics on its own (such as how both entanglements and interface structures can influence classical physics interactions by creating reality by 'creating descriptions of reality and related structures like relevance that are more real/relevant than classical physics can simulate', similar to how a computer might simulate reality better than reality bc of the simulation interface that supports the info interface where higher variation than reality can exist)
                - identifying useful intents of more advanced possible future machines like how the 'increase in possibilities' computed by quantum bits can be used in a case where a string of quantum bits can compute the answers to multiple questions at once based on how the manipulations occur at different qubit states which can influence the outcomes of the qubits to aggregate to different answers to different questions (applying structures/similarities in quantum bit structures/probabilities so that regardless of the original answer, its computing something useful like a 'useful difference type', not just 'one specific difference' like a 'true/false answer to one question' by aligning additional computations)
                - intents like 'this qubit is still holding potential info so it can be used to add uncertainty to another computation' can be computed with quantum computers, similar to how 'this bit is being accessed by a process so it cant be accessed by another process' can be computed with classical computers
            - similarity: similar to how its useful to have an 'interface analysis graph' and a 'brain', or a 'brain' and a 'classic computer', other types of computers will have dis/advantages that we havent used them enough to identify, and having these types of computer interact will likely be useful for various intents like 'identify new variation' or 'create uncertainty', similar to how a 'truth network' and a 'validity network' are useful as different bases to connect and vacillate between in queries
            - relevance: bc the irrelevance of the 'computation method' and the 'info being computed' is of 'undetermined relevance', similar to how the observer/observed connection is not irrelevant
            - variation: to add creativity to computing, like how creativity was useful for development of programming languages, and the usage of a language eventually produced an obvious pattern of interactions that identified problems like memory safety
                - the more info can be computed in parallel, the more time/variation the universe supports, similar to other computing optimization types like prediction and scaling chip performance (each optimization type being a type of time)
            - security/defense: to be prepared for antagonists and create alternative independent computer supply pipelines
                - 'more possible values per bit' is more security in a trivial way, especially with some qubit designs that could make the 'sets of manipulations that reveal its correct possible values' relatively rare
            - requirements: error-correcting codes reflect the 'requirements of reality' (as in 'what is required to preserve a structure despite its random interactions'), similar to statistics rules, so quantum computers are useful to build in order to identify other requirements of reality (like revealing the determinants of changes of interaction levels like 'quantum/classical physics' like 'convergence of sums above a ratio of reality/stability' like 'overlapping aggregations of waves required to create classical properties converging above the measurability threshold' or 'synchronizations' as opposed to 'simple unit aggregations' as 'structures that create reality')
            - completion: the limits of quantum computing havent been identified yet and until theyre at least visible, innovation is probably useful
        - math automation bc:
            - perspective/base: the specific structures on the math interface like 'matrixes' are useful as a 'starting point for queries' in a different direction than 'starting from interface structures like requirements' and may intersect with different useful structures while these two bases are being connected, bc of the different positions they start from and different structures they apply
            - specification: I understand 'query filters/bases' like 'similarities/differences' and other interfaces more clearly than other math automation workers given that I defined these structures in the most useful ways, but Im currently unaware of all the specific problems to abstract in math automation (what the tools already cover, what problems the tools are optimized to solve, etc) and working on this problem space directly to acquire that info would speed up that process of abstracting those in a useful way to cover the area between math/interface structures or solved/unsolved problems
            - scale/optimization: Ill be able to tell when an AI model applying interface analysis solves the problem in an optimizable way using some unidentified variable/interface, the more I work on the problem directly, and also more than the model or other math automation workers, given that I invented interface analysis
        - analyzing both fields will enable identifying useful math for quantum computing/physics which seems lacking, and which also seems useful for mining/creating new variation/interfaces to integrate into interface analysis

- how to implement the interface analysis framework as a set of simple functions for an initial version, involving alternate default constant simple structures to combine, such as:    

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs with solution metrics/intents that can be implemented with combinations/other interface structures of identified structures' and other graph variants that are useful for intents like 'identify relevant graphs'
        - for example, a graph where 'most points are similarly useful to start from' (filtering out the 'usefulness/bias/requirement' for a 'specific graph variable' like a 'starting point') can be implemented with a graph that has embedded graphs like a 'interface variable connection graph' and a 'iterated/combined/structured interface variable connection graph', so that most positions would have 'relevant variation' adjacently available
        - relatedly, identifying new cross-interface connections like 'a specific useful incomplete "intent" and "implementations" of that intent' is a source of relevant new variation
        - relatedly, another useful graph is a 'graph of interface structures applied as networks like cross-interface/iterated/combined networks, where the networks are connected with steps/state changes' like a network of 'definition/requirement/certainty networks, iterated n steps until each item variant has a specific/otherwise relevant example to adjacent networks' which is connected to networks that are relevant to definition networks, like 'system/function/usage/interaction networks', which are then similarly iterated/combined/otherwise relevantly changed to be optimally relevant to other relevant networks
        - relatedly, identifying 'which similarities to apply in which sequences' to connect problem/solution structures can involve applying graphs with solution/error structures like 'metrics' in different directions, where the 'generally correct direction across graphs to connect to some solution or avoid some error' is an example application of this set of graphs, where these graphs are connected to interface structures like how a graph of 'system requirements/functions/structures' implements interface variables that can be solution metrics like 'volatility', so identifying the 'volatility' in this and other relevant graphs allows filtering similarities by direction (apply changes that go nearer high volatility structures in most/common/otherwise relevant graphs to solve a problem opposed/corrected by volatility, for a problem that is accurately modeled/graphable in that graph)

    - identifying useful structures like 'structures to apply "relevant variation" in structures like graphs' for intents like 'filter relevant graphs'
        - for example, a graph where 'adjacency of connections' indicates 'similarities in connection functions' is a useful graph variant, applying an embedded variable in connection functions, which is useful to 'generate relevant variation' through those 'similarly different functions', which is a way to apply 'relevant variation' to 'filter relevant graphs'
        - relatedly, identifying 'intents that are fulfilled by a similarity' (identifying 'what the similarity connects' as 'possible intents fulfillable with that similarity') is useful to implement with 'intent combinations/connections/structures' that equal the similarity in some way (are 'similar to the similarity' in some way, like 'being a component of the similarity')
        - relatedly, the 'solution positions that always/consistently generate the optimal interface graph, when an interface is used to connect those solution positions' (or the 'changes in solution positions' or the 'solution similarities like solution types' that generate the optimal interface graph connecting those solution structures) are useful to identify
            - in this graph, 'specific structures (like solution structures)' are applied as 'certainty/limit structures of the graph, between which variables can be applied (like interface variables) to connect the certain/static solution positions'

    - identifying useful structures like 'different graphs connecting the same solutions (like solution types or interface variable-based solutions like a volatility-based solution)' can identify different useful graph similarities (like different connecting graphs of the same solutions as different interface graphs)
        - for example, identifying that 'different interfaces' likely create 'different graphs connecting the same solutions' is a useful base insight to apply changes to, like how 'different interface spectrums' can likely describe these differences between different interface graphs connecting the same solutions, so connecting volatility/sensitivity in different structures can likely describe differences between these graphs of different interface connections (volatility and sensitivity interact differently on the causal interface than on the structural interface bc of the definitions of those interface structures)
        - relatedly, 'interface variants (like scaled variants)' of interface functions (like concept combinations) are useful to implement with relevant interface structures like relevant spectrums/ranges (implementing 'concept combinations' by identifying 'relevant scale ranges' to implement it with like 'concept combinations for one variable type like booleans, for one function/change type like opposite' as one unit implementation, where 'concept combinations for scaled variable types like networks, for all core function/change types' are an upper limit of the implementation scale range), and 'unitary/combinable' implementations and other interface variant implementations (identifying a network implementation by identifying a variable implementation that can scale to networks) are similarly useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying interactions of irrelevant/independent/interface variables like 'causal networks' and 'definition networks' like 'causal networks of definition networks' and 'causal definition networks (what variables cause definitions, like general types or inputs which resolve ambiguities to specific concepts)' are useful to identify and filter for relevance

    - identifying useful structures like 'useful graph variants and related graph intents of these graph variants' to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'filtering relevant graphs'
        - for example, identifying that a useful variant of the 'uncertainty interface spectrum intersection graph' involves intents like 'identifying positions where one interface value intersects with another' (such as where 'an extreme of one interface spectrum becomes another interface') which involves intents like 'identifying similarities (intersections) that can represent interactions (an overriding or determining interface) between interface spectrums' is useful to identify different useful graphs, where identifying interfaces that 'intersect with multiple extremes of other interfaces' is another useful interface structure that can be generated with interface spectrum similarities like intersections, where 'matching similarities/interactions' (like by applying 'definitions of interactions' and the 'similarities between these definitions') is a useful problem-solving intent related to 'filtering relevant graphs'

    - identifying useful structures like 'new definitions of useful structures (like "difference from the relevant variation type graph") that allow optimized comparisons' to fulfill intents like 'optimizing problem-solving intents like comparisons/filtering' or specifically 'identifying new relevant variation'
        - for example, identifying 'relevant variation' can be implemented by identifying 'differences from already identified relevant variation in the graph of relevant variation in relevant graphs', which applies the 'relevant variation graph' as a base for the new 'definition of relevant variation' which can be used to identify new relevant variation (variation is only new/relevant, if its 'relevantly different' from the relevant variation types/similarities in the 'graph of relevant variation of graphs')
        - relatedly, similar to how the 'language graph' has 'relevant variation' in the form of 'interface structures (and their interface structures like their combinations/connections)', identifying optimizations to this graph which make it more trivial to identify its relevant variation is a useful intent to identify optimizations to other graphs (optimizations like 'removing duplicates', 'grouping by type/interactivity/system/interface structures', 'applying common words as hubs of networks', etc) and similarly, identifying graphs that are useful to build while optimizing this graph is similarly useful, like building graphs where 'certainties (like identified interface connections) are applied as core or limit structures' and other combinations of certainties/uncertainties applied as constants/variables of graphs, so that other optimizations can be identified while applying the original optimizations, by identifying 'graphs relevant to each optimization' like how a graph relevant to 'removing duplicates' (to standardize the language and avoid repetition) might be the 'abstract/specific graph (where 1:m connections are allowed between abstractions/specifications)' or other graphs that allow repetitions in a more useful way than the default language graph of 'definition similarity'
        - relatedly, identifying 'sequences of variables' to apply that allow a graph to be used for 'identifying relevant variation, while also connecting the relevant variation to other useful graphs (like a truth graph)' is useful, such as how a sequence like 'volatility, sensitivity, accuracy' (applied as a set of intersecting sequential spectrums such as in a 1:m connection graph like the 'abstract/specific graph') can identify connections between interface variables while also connecting to relevance structures like 'truth' by connecting those connections to 'accuracy'

    - identifying useful structures like 'alternate organizational functions of a graph of relevant variation graphs (from alternate derivation functions of relevant variation)' is useful to identify for intents like 'filter relevant graphs'
        - for example, identifying alternate ways to derive the 'relevant variation of a graph' is useful, like how 'what would be useful (like "intersecting similarities or additional circular layers or intersecting limits of the circle" would be useful in a circle graph)' and 'simplifications of a graph' (like how identifying 'two additional surprising dimensions' of a circular graph like a set of items that are connectible in that shape by some other variable set) would both identify the 'relevant variation' possible for the same graph in different ways, and 'changes of these intents' can identify new useful intents like 'what would be useful, compared to other relevant variation in other relevant graphs' which are useful to graph to identify new graph directions, and similarly these 'alternate ways to derive relevant variation of a graph' are useful for organizing the 'graph of relevant variation of graphs' (like organizing the 'graph of relevant variation in graphs' by useful integrations of 'simplifications of relevant variation in graphs, and the useful derivation methods of relevant structures in graphs like definitions of relevance')
            - this identifies graph organization functions like 'identify aligning axes of a high ratio of relevant graphs and graph them on the same axes' as a useful graph variant, as well as 'regularly applying the same axes to identify useful graphs like overlapping grids' to 'vary the base for relevant variation', so that its not all based on the same starting parameters (like the same system layer graph, with additional layers added for identifying relevant variation)
            - relatedly, abstract intents like 'identify new variation' can be implemented with 'specifying networks (like networks of recent relevant graphs)', which add an offsetting structure in the 'abstraction' variable (for a 'general' intent, implementing it is more trivial when adding 'specific' structures like 'specific relevant networks', like how 'recency' and 'new/variation' are relevant so identifying the 'recent relevant graph network' as a relevant specific network is trivial)
            - relatedly, identifying 'graphs of relevant variation', like 'all the relevantly different graphs that can generate/identify a specific relevant variation type/structure' (graphs with a similarity in what they identify, which are useful to connect in their own graph, like a 'graph of similarities that identify useful graphs to identify') is useful for identifying variants of graphs of relevant variation, which is useful for organizing 'graphs of relevant variation from graphs', where 'connections like overlaps/alignments between all the graph variants for each relevant variation type' are a useful 'graph of graphs' to identify, and where this 'graph intent sequence' is another example of identifying 'relevant variation of a graph' (as in 'what would be useful to change in/apply to a graph') and applying that relevant variation to identify 'useful next graphs to identify/apply in a sequence'
        - relatedly, identifying the useful interactions of cross-interface similarity/difference structures is useful, like how 'abstract similarities, requirement differences' can have useful interactions like 'different requirements of a concept definition network' or 'differences in requirements of a set of similar concepts', where the 'limits/interface structures of the usefulness of these interactions' are similarly useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying ways to graph 'connections with varying truth ratios' is useful, like how problem-solving workflows have a 'truth or relevance ratio' where they are relevant/useful/true, where a 'graph of falsehood/truth structures that identifies similarities in workflows/connections (to identify similar positions of falsehood/truth structures)' is a useful specific example of that graph
        - relatedly, a neural network trained on this data has to apply some 'specifying/iterated connections to useful structures' as well as applying 'variant-identifying functions (like a function to connect useful structures with relevant networks/bases)' to 'generate possible useful structures like variants of an example workflow, and identify when a structure is similar to a specific example useful structure like an example intent or interface query' so that the 'network model isnt only good at that example or trivial variants of it'
        - relatedly, identifying why there is a 'higher ratio of possible errors than solutions' is useful, such as how 'there are a lot of interface variables to optimize', there are few if any 'cross-all-interface optimizations' bc they are 'independent different variables (as opposed to extremely similar variables)' so they often have conflicts/tradeoffs rather than having enough similarities to be easily optimized in combination, there is high variation allowed in each variable as well, where the 'specificity of optimal interface interactions' is a result of these interfaces having extensive/complex definitions, which prevents 'most possibilities' from being correct, and also given that there are some definitions which are correct/certain and some structures which are more relevant within these definitions, all the other possible distortions of these certainties are definite errors, so the certainties are rare (bc 'many parameters are allowed to vary' and 'there are many similar alternatives with no certain optimal') and the optimal/stable/certain/correct interactions of those certainties are also rare (mostly involving the certain optimal interactions of definitions)

    - identifying useful structures like 'similarities in high variation interface structure sequences' that enable intents like 'filter relevant graphs (and graph structures like graph intent sequences)' and 'integrate graphs with workflows'
        - for example, identifying useful common graph intent sequence structural patterns like 'identify the useful point/line in a graph, then identify the useful variants of that point/line, then identify the graph of those variants, then identify the point that this graph represents on a graph of graphs, then identify patterns/similarities in that graph of graphs, then identify useful variants of that pattern/similarity, then identify the graph of those variants', etc which can be matched with variation in workflows (like how filter/generate have a filtering/compressing and a generating/expanding sequence, similar to this structural graph sequence) and can be applied as a default useful sequence to solve problems using graphs (like 'start with a relevant graph to the problem, then apply this graph sequence until a useful point on a graph of graphs is identified that has the structure of the solution, then stop applying the graph sequence')
            - relatedly, identifying the 'patterns/similarities/interface structures in interface structures' like 'graph integrations/variants/specifications' required to identify new relevant variation from some 'direction/position/graph' that is 'sufficiently different to be non-trivially connected' (like 'not connectible with one interface similarity') is useful to organize the 'graph of relevant variation from relevant graphs', and similarly applying interface structures like sequences/networks of 'relevant similarities (like relevant variants of similarity indexes)' to connect 'relevant variation from graphs' is useful for organizing the 'graph of relevant variation from relevant graphs'

    - identifying useful structures like 'useful variants (like relevant connection structures) of a network (like the relevant variation network)' which is useful for 'connecting similarities in relevant variation'
        - for example, identifying ways to connect 'all the types/similarities of relevant variation from useful graphs' such as 'connecting them by relevant variation types/similarities (applying relevant variation connections to connect relevant variation similarities like types or relevant variation from useful graphs)' or 'connecting relevant variation units like cross-interface similarity/difference structures like "abstract similarities/requirement differences" with 'interface structures (like useful limits) of relevant variation ' like "relevant variation in iteration of graph variables" (like relevant variation between graphs, such as relevant variation units like abstract similarities/requirement differences applied to useful graphs, applying it to iterations like graphs rather than applied as a unit definition)' is useful for intents like 'identifying useful variants of the relevant variation network'
        - relatedly, applying 'general intents' like 'identify new variation' are 'too general to be simple iterations' ('re-applying this intent' is not iterating the 'implementation or output of that intent') which are useful interface connections to identify ('a value/error (like an extreme or an excess) in this interface variable (generality) invalidates/limits this interface structure (iteration)')
        - relatedly, identifying 'worst cases' in problem-solving structures (like how the worst cases include 'an interface variable is totally missing' and 'the answer is completely independent, coming from a totally new direction that hasnt been identified/defined/implied by anything else', and 'the answer involves huge degrees of iterations in these unidentified directions' and 'the required iterations are beyond existing/adjacent computational capacities') is useful to implement in order to fulfill other error structures like 'combinations/integrations of worst cases' and 'solutions/functions/interface structures possible with these error case combinations/structures' (as in 'if these errors apply in this combination, what functionality/solutions exist'), and which is useful to create 'graphs of error combinations' to identify 'solutions that optimize avoiding/distancing from multiple worst case directions' as general intent directions that will always apply as error structures

    - identifying useful structures like 'default prioritized similarities to identify/generate in graphs' which are useful for 'filtering relevant graphs'
        - for example, identifying specifications of general intents like 'identify emergent similarities in a graph' is possible by applying 'combinations/interface structures of interface structures' like 'abstract/requirement similarities' and 'cross-network similarities' as default prioritized similarities to check for in graphs, as well as connecting these default useful similarities with 'generated graphs relevant to combinations/interface structures of interface structures (graphs that can be simplified/reduced/summarized/specified/integrated/etc as abstract/requirement similarities)', which is useful for intents like 'filtering relevant graphs'
        - relatedly, 'applying interface intents to graphs' is not a repetition of those intents but is useful in its interactions with other interface structures, bc of the relevance of graphs, which can involve replacing the value of other workflows by 'integrating them into graph space' which can simplify problem-solving in new ways
    
    - identifying useful structures like 'generation methods (like direction changes) of similarity/connection networks to connect useful structures' to fulfill intents like 'generate relevant structures'
        - for example, a method to generate new relevant structures is to "apply varying similarity/connection networks (like cross-interface structure similarity grids, like 'abstract/requirement' similarities, as a 'default identification network to be optimized with iterated queries') as connection networks between sets of useful structures with varying similarity types like 'maximally different useful structures'", or to 'generate these similarity networks by identifying sets of similarities between the set of useful structures iteratively', or to 'apply existing useful graph structures (like graph layers) as default similarity networks to optimize a connection between useful structures', after identifying a connection network description that is 'likely to be relevant to that set of useful structures' to filter this set of connection networks (like applying an abstract connection theorized to be relevant to a set of useful structures, to be specifically implemented with specific graphs or graph generation functions), which will identify 'useful connection network sequences to apply' to identify relevant connection networks for a set of structures

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph connection/similarity optimizations (like useful sequences of graph connection layers)' that are useful for intents like 'optimizing graph queries'
        - for example, 'hierarchical/causal query layers' can be identified that create 'concept queries' to identify 'conceptual understanding of a graph' (identify the causal sequence of query layers that can create adjacency/triviality in identifying connections on successive layers like concept layers)
            - relatedly, 'concept areas/structures' formed by 'conceptual connections in useful graphs' can be identified once 'interface connections of graph sets' are identified that can construct 'query spectrums/areas'
                - relatedly, identifying 'useful query similarities in graph spectrums' like similarities/connections in spectrums like 'changing the ratio of a set represented in the graph' and 'changing the format of similarities/differences in a graph (as somewhere on the similarity/difference spectrum like as adjacencies or opposing structures)' is useful to 'connect with query layers' to identify conceptual similarities in the graph spectrum similarities
        - relatedly, optimal variants of graphs are useful to identify, like 'a variant of the uncertainty interface variable spectrum graph' that is identified after applying 'certain connections' as an 'inner or outer layer' (as opposed to 'certain errors' like 'over-prioritization errors like extremes of interface spectrums'), where 'concept positions' may be identifiable in these 'certain connections'
        - relatedly, 'causal thought type/function networks' (involving thought types like 'emotion surprising status change signal thought inputs', 'default reaction thoughts, given a priority/perspective/history of thoughts and an experience to react to', 'thought-connection/combination/integration/other interface structure thoughts', 'thought network/base thoughts like validity network thoughts', 'thought-feeling interaction thoughts', 'thought-optimizing thoughts, like what thoughts optimize/generate other useful thoughts', and all the other interactions/functions/structures of thoughts) are useful to connect so this 'causal network of thought types' can be 'optimized'
            - this means rather than needing emotions/feelings to give the brain a signal to change some behavior, remove emotions and make the body more independent/creative/optimized so it can solve problems without contacting the brain for help, like rather than sending a food craving to the brain to get some nutrient, give the body tools to create those nutrients, or rather than sending a pain signal to the brain to tell it to avoid some painful interaction/object, give the brain a 'list of all the errors to avoid', or rather than relying on surprise to contact the brain to tell it that some new variation is occurring, give the brain a 'list of the most different variables and their connections', so its almost never surprised and always has a solution to connect some difference, and rather than relying on the body to direct the brain and actions or relying on the brain to identify the optimal thought in response to some input, give the brain a 'graph of feelings/emotions and optimal reactions/thoughts/actions in response to those inputs', and rather than allowing a causal sequence like 'experience -> feeling (pain/dopamine) -> emotion (horror/happiness) -> thought (change/continue behavior)', causal sequences like 'think about what thought would change this feeling (thought -> thought -> feeling) or what experience would create this feeling that is a useful input to this thought (thought -> experience -> feeling -> thought)' are more useful variants of these 'default thought/feeling interaction sequences/networks'

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph variants like integrations/networks of "similarity embeddings" of "relevant variation" structures' that are useful for intents like 'identify relevant graphs'
        - for example, identifying new relevant variation structures is useful, like 'relevant variants of networks of different relevant variation structures (like "embedded similarities") like relevant similarities (like "ranges") on other relevant similarities (like "graph spectrums")', which are useful for integrating into new networks of relevant variation structures, like 'networks of maximally different relevant variation structures'
        - relatedly, applying this 'network of relevant variation structures' can be done by identifying useful similarities/differences to 'filter relevant graphs', like 'applying a "set of differences" as a closed shape border' and applying relevant variation structures from other graphs as connection/organization structures of 'closed shape borders formed by the "difference set to be connected"'

    - identifying useful structures like 'ways that new problems can be identified/generated by applying interface combinations that create new relevant changes (like relevant variants of a graph, like error graphs of a graph)'
        - for example, identifying all the ways problems might not be completely solved, like how interface structures might 'change or be identified as incorrect or not required or incomplete or otherwise different in an interface way' such as how 'standards might change and bases might changes and limits might be incorrect and scales might change, which creates a new relevant change type' and all the outputs of those combinations of changes, like 'rather than this similarity/difference explaining some system, a scaled/standardized similarity/difference might be more relevant like more determining, given this new standard/limit difference combination', so identifying graph variants that apply these 'combinations of interface changes' to identify 'different relevant variants of useful graphs' is a useful way to fulfill the intent of 'identifying relevant graphs' or 'identifying new useful structures'
            - similarly, 'error graphs of a graph' (like the graphs where a function is an error/solution, or all the error graphs of concepts like simplicity, or 'graph error' graphs) are useful to identify in order to identify different variants of the graph that might be useful for problem-solving intents by default, by connecting relevant error/solution variants of a graph
            - relatedly, 'graphs with extreme independent variables (like having only simplicity error types without defining/requiring simplicity or simplicity errors)' are useful to identify as a graph type, and similarly other graph type variants are useful to identify, comparing the 'defined/emergent types as interface variable variants like "extremely independent"', which are useful to apply as 'graph spectrums' and apply to identify 'intersections of graph spectrums' that create 'networks of graph spectrums' which can be used as a new 'similarity network of graphs'

    - identifying useful structures like 'variables of graphs (like different generative directions) that can connect relevance structures (like relevant variation generating graphs)'
        - for example, identifying 'different directions to generate a structure from' like 'generating relevant variation by applying interfaces to its definition to create a definition network' and 'high variation combinations of interface parameters and all combinations of these (which identify different relevant variation in queries and query params like starting points)' and 'integrating relevant variation in different useful graphs to create a network of relevant variation' can be useful for generating graphs integrating these directions, like a 'graph of these graphs of relevant variation'

    - identifying useful structures like 'high variation interface combinations' that can fulfill intents like 'identify different useful bases/combinations to start applying interface analysis to generate interface queries'
        - for example, identifying 'high variation interface-interface combinations (like interface set-iteration combinations)' is useful, such as how 'a combination of "abstraction/structure/function parameters" and the interface iterations of those (all/relevant interactions of abstraction/structure/function up to n degrees)' and a 'starting useful set of parameters (as a graph of graphs of useful bases to generate interface queries) and a query to identify other useful sets' are high variation combinations which could potentially be more optimal bases to apply as starting points for interface analysis, given the high variation of these combinations and the high variation in their usefulness and the probability that some subset will be more useful than other variants

    - identifying useful structures like '"causal distance" which represent "degree of variation" that can connect "graphs with the relevant variation they can optimally identify"'
        - for example, identifying 'variables with a causal distance' that are optimal for the relevant variation identifiable in some graph is useful, like how 'relatively similar causal variable connections' (such as abstract/interface similarities between variables) are useful to identify averages/limits in a 2-d graph that can handle that 'degree of variation', which connects 'graphs with the variation they can optimally identify'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'optimal ratio of a problem instance/integration/etc to another problem instance/integration/etc' is a useful problem-solving structure (such as how a function can be either an error or a solution structure, given some ratio of other related errors/solutions, like some 'policy against crime' can be useful/useless in a context with some ratio of 'crime' to 'justice')

    - identifying useful structures like 'useful graphs to identify patterns in and connections between other relevant graphs (like the graphs of different ways to identify relevant variation) and ways to connect the structures of relevant variation as theyre defined/occur in these graphs'
        - for example, identifying 'structures of relevant variation' on one graph that represents new relevant inventions/insights (like a 'graph applying layers of changes to core functions or other maximally different structures') and connecting these relevant variation structures to the corresponding structures on all the other graphs that represent new relevant inventions/insights (like 'graphs of independent variables represented as maximal differences, and the connections of these variables' where the 'relevant variation' has a structure of 'new simple connections between independent variables') is useful as a way to identify the 'graph of graphs of relevant as in new variation or the integrated/generative graph of these graphs', where 'maximal relevant variation of a graph' is another useful graph metric to identify given some related metric like 'number of iterations applied to the graph (like number of layers, or number of relevant variation connections already identified)'

    - identifying useful structures like 'variants of cross-graph connections/similarities and their connections to relevance' that are useful for 'integrating graphs by relevance' and 'filtering relevant graphs'
        - for example, identifying all variants of 'connections/similarities between core graph types' (like the 'core function type partition graph' and the 'uncertainty/over-prioritization graph') and how these connections can interact with relevance (like how these connections can be ir/relevant and how to increase their relevance) is useful, such as how its useful to identify the 'structural similarity between these graphs' and identify 'other relevant similarities based on that similarity', like how a partition of the 'uncertainty/over-prioritization graph' could map to 'function types/other interface variable types'
            - similarly, identifying the 'variants of interactions of cross-interface structures' like 'algorithms/graphs' (functions/structures or intents/structures) is useful, such as how graphs to identify algorithms, algorithms formatted as graphs, algorithms to optimize graphs, etc are all useful variants of this cross-interface connection to identify and integrate into a graph that optimizes these 'cross-interface structures for their related intents'
        - relatedly, identifying structures like 'counts/sequences/networks/iterations/interface structures of cross-interface connections (like independent variable intersections or vertexes or other cross-interface structures)' required to create 'relevant variation' is useful for intents like 'predicting the next relevant structure, given a set of identified relevant structures' to identify a graph that has these 'similarities between relevant structures' built-in, where 'identifying the remaining relevant structure, given the other identified relevant structures in a set, for all structures in the set' is a useful intent to generate this graph (or its 'core layers' like its 'defining/example starting point')
        - relatedly, queries like 'is there a graph that doesnt involve an alternative solution in most/any directions with enough changes' (given how alternate solutions can exist which dont solve for patterns in the original data set, but which solve an adjacent/otherwise relevant problem like solving for patterns in that data set in a different but related system, or which solve a causal problem, or solve the problem in an abstract or otherwise different way) are high variation so these are sources of variation to identify new relevant graphs (whats a graph that can make this query more answerable/computable)

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph errors/optimizations (like over-optimization for simplistic solution structures like one solution metric) that are identifiable with other graphs (like the uncertainty/over-prioritization graph) by identifying graph ranges on some graph variable (like linearity of a problem/solution connection)'
        - for example, identifying that a 'graph with a linear/simple connection (as opposed to a complex connection) between some "problem/solution type/similarity set" on that graph' probably has an over-prioritization error in that it likely optimizes for one metric which is that set and isnt generally useful is a way to apply the 'uncertainty/relevance intersecting spectrum graph' to optimize other graphs like identifying 'relevant graph ranges of linearity of the connection between some problem/solution set', and its also possible to optimize graphs for multiple problem/solution types/similarities and its also improbable/unrealistic for a simple/linear connection to be correct/relevant

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph variants (like different error states or different concept bases) applied as similarities/differences'
        - for example, identifying graph variants is useful, like variants of the 'uncertainty/relevance intersecting spectrum graph' like to indicate 'different error states', like where 'every error occurs at once' like where extremes values of spectrums occur in the same position, and integrating different bases like how the original graph has a center which represents a base to assess 'difference from uncertainty/relevance' by 'distance from the central intersection'

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph interaction optimization rules' like 'how to embed/apply graphs optimally to reflect useful similarity/difference structures like "certainty structures (like identified interactions) and possible counterpoints (like randomness)" as well as "different direction limits (ranges) on uncertainty structures", given error structures like "error counts"'
        - for example, identifying 'graph interaction optimization rules' like 'where to embed an interface network in a graph' (like embed an interface network at reference/interactive values of the 'uncertainty/relevance intersecting spectrum graph' like 'extremes/averages' and also embed an interface network at random points once the interactive values are analyzed, for identifying errors related to error types like over-prioritizations like how 'extreme specificity can over-focus on what currently exist so it leaves out the potential interface' which is another error related to over-specificity, so given the 'error count', a rule can be applied like 'an interface network might be worth embedding once multiple possible errors are identified, and given that these "errors arent required" and "dont occur elsewhere" like at "higher interactivity points like multi-functional/interface points"', which is a 'sufficient combination/count of error structures' to justify identifying all interface interactions with that error, so embedding an interface network at that position is justified, after which point 'embed an interface network at random points' can identify new/missing interactive values as a 'counterpoint to identified certainties' to check for ways those certainties might 'change or be incorrect/incomplete')
        - relatedly, its useful to identify how graphs can connect structures like 'connect problem/solution structures', so that for example, with a 'graph of an intersection of independent variables', that can be positioned so that it intersects with the problem position as well, so that a 'solution position can be connected to the other axis (if the other axis is a general/specific solution metric)'
        - relatedly, 'implementing workflows/interface queries' automatically involves 'identifying already identified useful interface networks like useful function/variable networks' and 'identifying connections between the workflow/query/intent and those networks'
        - relatedly, matching useful graph structures like the 'usefulness of centering a variable (like abstractions)' (like to 'optimize for starting queries in the center as an easier variable to filter first', as well as 'allowing for similarities to be identified in opposing spectrums' and 'allowing for higher variation in the non-central variable like specifications') with variable sets like requirements/intents or functions/variables or abstractions/specifications that have some abstract similarity that connects them is useful for 'filtering/generating useful graphs'
        - relatedly, identifying that 'simplicity' is a 'causal error type' that cause the over-prioritization errors in the 'uncertainty/relevance intersecting spectrum graph' is useful for identifying that only a component of simplicity's definition causes this error type (the 'limit on variable count' part of the 'simplicity' definition) and therefore there are other 'components of the simplicity definition network' that identify other useful 'similarities in errors' that are useful for 'filtering/generating useful graphs'

    - identifying useful structures like 'different ways to generate a problem-solving graph' to fulfill intents like 'identify relevant graphs across problem-solving intents'
        - for example, identifying a graph that has all possible interactions between (as in it 'applies and embeds and iterates and integrates and organizes and emerges as and implements and implies and defines') other relevant graphs like the 'uncertainty/relevance intersecting spectrum graph' is more useful at solving all problems (connecting all structures) and is likelier to allow different connection types between the same structures to allow more optimal connections for alternate sets of solution metrics, where 'connecting all possible problem/solution metrics' is another way to generate a graph that solves all problems, where 'identifying the structures that optimize these function interactions' is useful to generate that graph
        - relatedly, a good metaphor for why algorithms dont work sometimes is bc when applying algorithms as 'certainty structures' (like 'containers' or 'filters') applied to other 'certainty structures' like networks (such as 'inputs/generators of the container'), info/data structures in those containers cant create target insight/solution structures regardless of the transform applied (such as how a 3-step algorithm cant be identified with a container that only allows a size of 2-step algorithms to be constructed, where the 3-step algorithm would be more optimal), where a more realistic example is how algorithms typically are built to identify one solution function as opposed to a network or set of solution functions which is usually more optimal such as to indicate 'solution function state change sequences' or 'similarly probable solution variants', and the algorithm cant generate that more optimal solution format given how its built
            - similarly, identifying what the correct info structure of the solution (or the correct info structures of adjacent structures like the 'changes required to get to the solution') is, is possible by identifying what algorithms dont work (identifying that a solution has multiple variants by identifying that algorithms to identify one solution, like algorithms that stop after the first prioritized algorithms work, are insufficient to identify the correct solution format, bc the algorithm doesnt apply 'solution format' as a variable for example)
            - similarly, the 'changes required to create the solution from inputs' can fail to be identified in some algorithms, like where there is low info content and its regularized/standardized/randomized out by those processes, so the algorithm fails on low info content inputs
            - so the core point here is that 'edge cases identifiable with iterated interface structures like "interface variables" like "info ratio" or "variation ratio" or "info limits"' are useful to identify and apply as maximally relevant test cases for each algorithm, to identify correct solution info structures as well as correct 'solution variables' (like 'solution metrics/requirements' and 'solution formats') and the same for correct 'changes/bases/networks/structures possible/required by the algorithm' as well as correct 'changes/distributions/ratios/problems/structures possible/required in the input data'
        - relatedly, regarding optimal graphs/queries to identify the most relevant insights, useful structures which fulfill general solution metrics (like 'simple cross-interface connections' or 'multi-functional definitions' or 'highly interactive concept networks like average/standard concept networks') are useful to apply in similarity structures and also apply similarities to these structures to identify variants, which are useful to apply as 'workflow components' bc workflows connect interface structures to problem/solution structures (like 'find simple cross-interface connections', and the solution is likely to be in that set or adjacent to that set)
            - relatedly, 'similarities/alignments across interface networks' like aligning the 'core/average/standard/interface variables of intents/functions/definitions/variables' across interfaces might be a useful graph to identify the biggest differences/similarities quickly with 'trivial differences like rotations' or 'difference-maximizing connections', to 'filter core definitions', 'connect core concepts/intents', 'filter high potential functions' and other useful intents

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections across/on graphs that reflect similarities (like adjacent spectrum connections)u that are relevant to workflows (like workflow variants or components)'
        - for example, identifying graphs to automate workflows is useful, such as an 'intersecting spectrum graph of problem types or problem-solving intents' or an 'intersecting spectrum graph of interface variables' or an 'intersecting spectrum graph of graphs', where queries apply useful 'connecting structures' relevant to these graphs like 'spirals' or 'cross-graph connections by positional alignments/other similarities', and where 'adjacent spectrums indicate similarities' so 'connections between spectrums' can be used as a 'component of workflows/queries', where the 'interactions with interface spectrums' are the simplifying variable that identifies the 'most relevant insights in the sequence traversing the graph', so these insights can be generated/predicted using that graph
        - relatedly, identifying useful graph insights (like intersections/alignments/similarities/other relevance structures) is possible by applying relevance graphs as layers to other graphs to check if there is a useful relevance structure like a similarity (applying the 'intersecting spectrum graph of interface variables' as a layer on other graphs to identify alignments/similarities/relevance between interface variables and error/solution structures across graphs, to identify for example 'complete sets of error/solution structures' by identifying graphs that can be applied to each other to complete a 'error area' on another graph), and similarly, identifying 'graphs of relevance standards' like a 'relevance value spectrum' is useful to identify 'other possible graphs with different relevance values, by identifying gaps in relevance values', which can identify related intents like 'identify upper/lower range graphs with the problems/solutions as adjacent/distant points' and related workflows like 'identify a graph with problems/solutions already connected (such as adjacent) by identifying structures that are "different from both the problem/solution structures"' and repeat this for every problem/solution pair (like every problem/solution metric pair) to identify 'graph spectrums where problems/solutions are distant/adjacent' for each pair as well as 'intersections/similarities between these problem/solution graph spectrums' as default problem-solving structures to apply

    - identifying useful structures like 'ratios of interface variables (like count) of interface structures that are determinable by interface variables like interactivity' that can be applied to generate useful graphs like a 'graph of limits of relevant variation across interface variables of interface structures'
        - for example, identifying determinable probabilities of 'ratios between interface structures' of systems is useful, like how mappings like 'multiple usage networks per core function type' and 'multiple functions per core variable' are more probable bc of 'dynamics of interactivity/specificty', where a relevant graph would identify overlapping/otherwise similar limits/areas/structures of relevance of a set of variables, given a set of interfaces like 'a structure and a cause' (how much specialization or implementation can affect variability or interactivity, given a set of structures), where the specifying interface structures determine the limits of this relevance, so identifying a manifold or other graph variant structure of these graphs is useful to identify, given sets of commonly isolatable variables
            - this can be optimized in relevance like by identifying 'maximum distance ratios' where some variable like 'graph generation similarity count' impacts distant variables like 'graph emergent similarity count' bc of some variable value like 'lack of interactivity with independent variables', where the set of different alternate 'relevant connecting variable sets' is sortable (some variable that connects these distant variables trivially and commonly is prioritized)
            - applying a comparison structure like a 'specific (like distant) interface variable (like type) comparison (like ratio)' as the basis for a graph identifies various alternate similarity structures that are relevant for that comparison (the example comparison could be the only comparison of that type in the graph, or it could be one in a set of other examples of that type, or it could be only applied to identify other comparisons of another type, thereby implementing a variant of an abstract comparison network in each graph), which is similar to a 'graph of structures of relevant variation' (like 'more optimal variants' and 'limit/average variants' and 'connecting variants') which enables queries of meaning across these networks, like 'identify the structure of relevant variation/comparison that is useful, given this network of problem types/problem-solving intents'
        - relatedly, identifying unusual useful network interactions like how 'random selections of subsets of a set of filters would be more useful to be able to select than non-random subsets (the selection is random but the selected subset is still relevant bc of emergent interaction variables between the filters)' or how 'overlapping networks can be queried with rotation queries to identify similarities within n rotations' could be a useful way to solve function filtering problems (such as by identifying meanings like 'reasons' for components of functions, which form sequences when the networks are rotated that explain 'reasonable different alternative functions') which can be increased in relevance with connections to interface variables like 'reasons' to identify 'what network interactions would be useful' and filter these by 'possibility/computation limits/computation capacities'
        - relatedly, identifying the relevance of graph similarities and queryable differences is useful to identify the net relevance of a graph (like how a graph 'input/cause' similarity might enable a relevant difference in 'output/intent' fulfilled by connecting causes with queries on that graph, or how a 'similarity in the graph to a solution graph enables relevant variation in that the new graph might be able to solve related problems as the original graph') which is a useful way to generate graphs to generate/apply similarity/difference structures like 'relevant variation'

    - identifying useful structures like 'networks of workflow node networks' that havent been optimized/applied optimally given the variation mismatch between 'identified workflow networks' and 'probable optimal variants of these networks'
        - for example, identifying workflow network variants, like workflow node networks optimized for intents/problem types, networks of workflow-optimizing workflows (whether a workflow is mostly only useful for optimizing other workflows or is useful independently), workflow node networks that regularly apply a specific useful structure like a similarity index, workflow node networks optimized to identify 'workflows that should be applied as inputs/components/variants/integrations/applications/other interface structures of other workflows', intersecting workflow networks at relevant similarities, workflow network iterations like 'workflow node networks to identify useful workflow node networks', 'useful workflow network'-generating graphs, workflow node networks created by iterating variants like 'maximally different adjacent layers of workflow nodes/variables of workflows' and other integrations of networks to generate workflow networks as 'causal networks of workflow networks' and 'limiting networks of workflow networks', networks integrating all these variants of workflow networks, and 'networks to identify useful starting points for solving a problem' on this 'network of workflow networks', given that one workflow network is unlikely on its own to cover all possible useful workflow configurations for all problems (including workflow problems), which can identify the 'general usefulness/relevance of a workflow across these workflow networks' (and other relevance metrics of workflows) to identify prioritized workflows and other interface structures of workflows
        - relatedly, other problem-solving structures include 'connections (reasons/incentives) to solutions (non-selfish actions) using suboptimal/error functions (selfishness) or from error positions (selfishness)' ('whats a selfish reason to avoid crime' like 'to avoid cost') given that its probable that all errors cant be filtered out so identifying ways to create high value outputs like solutions from low-cost inputs like errors is useful (specifically 'using selfishness to violate the definition of selfishness', converting it to a solution concept)
            - similarly, identifying 'errors possible in non-error structures (like definitions) or non-error structure applications (like examples)' as in, does this structure (like a 'definition of a concept like kindness/stupidity' or a 'set of variants like examples of kindness/stupidity') contain a possible error (like 'crime') as in 'can kindness/stupidity possibly lead to an example of a crime' or 'is there an example of kindness/stupidity that matches the definition of crime' which applies cross-interface structures (by applying a 'definition' of a concept to create 'examples' of it, can an 'example' of another irrelevant concept be identified)
            - similarly, identifying the integrations of cross-interface problem-solving structures that are useful for a specific problem structure is a general problem-solving intent ('oppose the concept that leads to this error', 'oppose the direction that leads to this error in this graph', 'oppose the function that leads to this error', and 'integrate these oppositions in a graph/network/workflow')

    - identifying useful structures like 'organizations of mixed similarity type graphs (like organization by relevant/useful graph position, given some probable falsehood ratio of a similarity)'
        - for example, generating 'mixed similarity type' graphs (as an interim structure between 'applying useful similarity structures as possibilities as in emergent similarities', and 'applying useful similarities as certainties to generate a graph') is a way to identify 'patterns/connections/similarities in similarities across graphs', where organizing the mix of similarity types can be optimized to more efficiently filter possible graph similarities by applying similarity types in probably relevant positions given adjacent similarities (if one similarity turns out to be 'some probable ratio of true/false', position it so that the next adjacent graphs use that ratio to emphasize information)
        - relatedly, identifying a 'graph or network of graphs' to 'identify all relevant (as in important/useful) numbers' is possible, bc different graphs make different relevant interactions between numbers obvious, so that a graph sequence like a 'core layer of different number bases/formats followed by interface graphs of interface networks of those bases/formats, up to a limiting set of graphs indicating the limits of relevance or certain irrelevant graphs' (connecting simple certain structures of relevance to limits on relevance like random relevance to cover an uncertainty graph area) can be a useful organizational function for identifying all relevant numbers (as opposed to applying an average/standard/base graph like the real number line or a euclidean space and interface variants of it to extend it and identify other relevant graphs), similar to how a graph of 'all possible concept combinations/structures' can identify 'remaining concept combinations/structures that havent been connected to a relevant number yet', where the target graph is a 'graph of the important numbers', where the systems that identify/create their relevance are useful extensions/specifications of this graph

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between similarity sequence types on graphs and problem/solution structures solvable with those graphs'
        - for example, a similarity network query like a 'similarity embedding sequence' like 'patterns in queries on graphs' might be similar to requirements/reasons, which connects the sequence to relevant structures like problem/solution structures, which is a way to apply queries from a network like a 'similarity network' to another graph
        - relatedly, identifying possible relevance of structures of queries like the 'maximum distance-covering (longest) queries' and 'queries covering a ratio of a graph' and 'queries connecting all nodes' is useful to identify connections between queries that form alternate useful graphs ('graphs of useful queries on a graph' or 'graphs of patterns of queries on a graph')

    - identifying useful structures like 'alignments in optimal point sequences on a graph and intents like "filter relevant graphs" using "graph connection layers"'
        - for example, identifying 'connections between optimal/relevant points of a graph' is a way to identify 'sequences which can be connected with graphs to create "relevant graph sequences"' since the points are relevant by being identified on the same graph and similar in relevance, so applying a 'graph connection layer' to this graph is a way to identify 'relevant graph sequences', like for example with the 'uncertainty spectrum intersection graph', where 'relevant points can be connected to graphs (like graphs of the intersecting/adjacent variables at those relevant points)' where those graphs can be connected in relevant sequences with standard integration rules like 'apply common variables between graphs as connections between graphs to fulfill problem-solving intents like "remove variables" or "connect graphs in a connection/similarity sequence that could be a problem-solving sequence"'
        - relatedly, identifying organizational rules for 'connecting graph structures' like rules indicating how to 'identify/structure relevant graphs for a primary base graph', like 'graph networks for each point on a base graph' or 'graph spectrums that intersect at a point on a base graph' or 'one-to-one graph mappings between a graph and a point on a base graph' is similarly useful for implementing the intent of 'filtering relevant graphs'

    - identifying useful structures like 'relevant intents to "filter relevant graphs" that help fulfill that intent, like graph integration rules or graph-intent connection rules'
        - for example, identifying structures that fulfill intents like 'filter graph integration rules' is a way to fulfill relevant problem-solving intents like 'filter relevant graphs', such as how a rule like 'identify graphs/rules to integrate graphs (like "identify graphs integrating all relevant variables in the sequence" or "identify common base variables in the sequence to standardize other variables to" or "identify graph sequences that can be skipped like how b given a and c given b might allow a graph of c given a to be relevant") of interface structures (like identify "abstract solution requirements", then identify "solution metric similarities") in problem-solving structures like workflow/intent sequences/networks' (as in 'if there is a workflow involving the sequence "abstract solution requirements", then "solution metric similarities", relevant graphs might include a graph of abstract solution metric similarities or general abstract similarities or abstract requirement similarities or solution metric similarities given abstract solution requirements')
            - similarly, identifying graph-intent relevant connection rules are useful, like identifying 'what graph integration rules decrease relevance for an intent'

    - identifying useful structures like 'algorithm structures like vertexes with enough info to filter relevant graphs'
        - for example, when applying 'algorithms as a vertex' (like 'only apply an optimistic algorithm in a case with low info rewards when there is an algorithm to create relevance or return to relevance from any position'), the possibility of these algorithms is variable (its possible to decrease info so much like with filters/abstraction that its not possible to generate relevance from that info), which is a 'graph to apply in combination with this algorithm vertex' (check if the position of info content in that graph indicates that info content is sufficient that the algorithm vertex is still relevant/useful), which is useful to identify as a source of information to 'filter relevant graphs' based on sequences/combinations/vertexes/structures of algorithms, which identifies a graph of 'relevant algorithm structures, based on interface variables like info content' as a relevant graph for 'continuing/changing algorithms'
            - similarly, identifying a concept (like 'randomness') that could identify a 'reason to continue', given some algorithm structure, and a sequence of test states (like a 'sequence of prior errors'), and the resulting implications about distributions/other interface variables of data sets (given the algorithm structure and sequence of test states), is similarly useful to identify for all possible variants of these structures as a relevant graph (graph the concepts that can add valuable info at various configuration points, given algorithm structures and cases/test states and resulting implications), which applies a 'regular check for relevance (by applying implications, a relevance-identifying structure)' once enough relevant variation is identified by combining cross-interface structures
        - relatedly, the relevant graphs to solve a problem involve by default the set of graphs that fulfill problem-solving intents like 'simplify a problem' (a graph that simplifies problem variables might fulfill this intent for example) or 'identify new variation' (a relevant graph in the sense of being new as in 'graphing new variation' might be relevant across problems as well), in addition to 'graphs with relevant similarities' like 'interface variables in common' as mentioned elsewhere
        - relatedly, the 'number of relevant connections' required to implement a problem-solving intent is useful to identify, such as the 'number of relevant connections' required to implement a general intent like 'filter relevant graphs'
            - relatedly, the 'number of relevant iterations of a graph generation function' like the 'number of iterations required to generate relevance, in a graph of iterated interface structure sequences like workflows/intents/cross-interface structures' is useful to identify for different graph generation functions and their bases (like the 'starting point and input components' for a graph generation function)

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph function endpoints' which are useful for 'filtering useful graphs'
        - for example, graph similarities/iterations/extensions can be applied until some structure is identified, like 'excess intersections/overlaps occur' or 'another relevant graph is generated' or an 'error boundary/area/pattern is identified', which can be applied as a stopping point for the similarity/iteration/extension to fulfill some completeness metric or stop for additional iterations of analysis
        - relatedly, a 'graph where adjacent/similar graphs in any/different direction are relevant bases' is a useful graph to identify
        - relatedly, different relevant sets of structures/functions are bases for workflows, like 'identify components' and 'sort priorities' and 'filter solutions' and 'oppose differences' and 'connect differences' and 'reverse errors' which can be applied as nodes of a 'graph that connect workflows' to identify problem/solution structures connectible with sequences of workflows or useful specification/variants of this graph to identify useful interface queries, as well as identifying useful graphs to implement these 'workflow bases'
            - relatedly, identifying similarities between the 'generative/base/emergent similarity of a graph' and the 'workflows enabled by it' is useful (the base similarity of a graph being relevant to 'oppose differences' and the workflow supported by that graph being a set including 'connect differences')

    - identifying useful structures like 'multiple variants (like "sorts") of networks like the problem type/problem-solving intent network, limited by possible query errors and solutions to query errors'
        - for example, in the problem type/problem-solving intent network of increasingly specific/relevant/otherwise useful filters (like the 'filter' type, followed by problem-solving intents like 'filter by this base', and 'filter based on this problem, using this similarity/concept'), inevitably errors will occur in some type-intent-solution queries for some problems, like 'everything has been filtered out without finding a solution' or 'the remaining items are not solutions, based on some metric' which can be opposed with useful differences like 'generate missing data' or 'generate abstractions/expansions of the set to increase the set of possible solutions and remove a specification/filter', where this network is useful as a default query network with error-handling, where this network can be sorted to create multiple variants of queries like 'sorting by generality or other interface metrics' (the most general or common filters can occur first after the problem type)

    - identifying useful structures like 'ways to determine graph relevance to create a network of relevant graphs' like the 'abstract-specific problem type' and 'problem type sequence graph'
        - for example, relevant graphs or graph layers to apply are maximally different/abstract problem type networks (starting with abstract types and generating more specific types progressively, possibly connected to solution types), at which point other problem type graphs become relevant, like 'problem type sequence graphs', so that when a problem type is solved, the next problem type to expect is determined by the next relevant graph which is the 'problem type sequence graph', which can be identified by applying 'state changes or other interface variables' to 'problem/solution structures' (like 'problem-solving process state') and similarity of structure ('problem type' graphs)
            - similarly, other relevant graph sequences are useful to identify, like the relevant graph sequence of 'variable combinations to graph' (like prioritizing high variation variables first) in cases like 'when relevant variables are unidentified', which can identify a network of cases of missing info (a specific problem type network) and relevant graph sequences associated with those cases (specific variants of the missing info problem type), where these specific problem type networks are useful to integrate and apply as a default query-building network
            - identifying other 'reasons to switch graphs or graph layer (other similarity types determining these switching functions)' are useful to identify, other than 'arriving at a similarity like an intersection/overlap between graph networks'
            - for example, if solving a sub-problem results in 'identifying a new powerful maximally different variable (like a new interface or a new useful graph or query optimization)', identifying how to apply that new useful graph to finish the overall workflow/query (finish solving the original problem) is useful to identify, since this new useful graph may override the relevance of other variables already identified and therefore change the rest of the query to solve the original problem (so the point is, generate a network of these maximally different variable interactions and identify specific ways those interactions could connect different structures like relevant graph sequences/networks)
        - relatedly, identifying a set of 'graphs to navigate/filter/change/generate/apply graphs in networks/spaces of graphs' is useful to identify useful new 'graphs and graph similarities/connections/organizations' (whats the best set of graphs for comparing/encoding/describing/filtering/etc other graphs)

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph intent sequences (like applying differences to reflect a similarity like a bias in a direction) which are useful for identifying relevant/prioritized graph optimizations (like applying a bias in a direction, which is relevant to identify before other structures)'
        - for example, an optimized variant of the 'uncertainty interface spectrum intesection graph' can be identified by 'identifying relevant points in the graph (like optimal spectrum value intersections)' and then re-organizing positions of spectrums to standardize/similarize these points in a 'pattern/cluster/alignment/other similarity structure', which is possible since 'not all values of a type (like extremes) on the graph are equal in relevance'
            - relatedly, identifying useful graph intent sequences like first 'identify relevant points (like interactive points)', then 'connect relevant points (to identify patterns/similarities)', then 'identify optimal points (where the relevant points would be more useful at, for some metric)', then 'connect relevant/optimal points (to optimize for some metric like performance for a graph query)' enables identifying optimizations to these graphs using these structures once identified to implement workflows involving similarities/differences (like 'similarities to connect differences between relevant/optimal graph structures')
            - relatedly, identifying useful graph variants like 'a graph variant with distributed as opposed to clustered relevant points' for intents like 'building solutions using this graph as a component' (with specifications like 'building solutions using the average of this graph as a component')
            - relatedly, its not likely that the 'average variant of a graph' is always identifiable as the useful variant to apply, but some intents like 'identifying the useful variant' are optimized by this intent, which identifies 'info not likely to be known about a graph' (like 'its optimized variant/application for general problem-solving intents') as a useful source of variation for new problem-solving structures, which identifies 'general/proxy descriptions of graphs (and the resolutions of these ambiguities)' as useful to identify the relevant variant of a graph
        - relatedly, identifying workflow/query sequences like 'similarity/difference interface (to identify problem/solution differences), then similarity index network (to standardize differences and identify any new differences), then connections between the similarity index network and graphs associated with differences on that network (to identify useful associated graphs to resolve standardized differences on the similarity index network), then graph interface (to resolve those differences with queries on associated graphs)' based on 'integrations of highly filtering variables' like 'available info, or matched identifiable variation positions, or problem-solving intent/problem type' is useful to create 'integrated networks/hierarchies of info sequences' (where 'differences between problem/solution' and 'differences between problem/other problems is likely to be available info) with a specific 'starting base structure' (as in the 'info likeliest to be available')

    - identify useful structures like 'graph structures like "spectrum value application gaps"' that can be used to fulfill intents like 'identify new variation and base new workflows/solutions on that variation'
        - for example, the conceptual solution metric spectrums will have gaps in what values on the spectrum have been optimized/applied in a problem-solving workflow or solution, and these gaps can be used to identify possible sources of variation to identify new problem-solving workflows or solutions, as a 'useful difference to reflect new variation', and similarly 'matching gaps to relevant structures like limits (asymptotes)' is useful as an 'offsetting correcting counterpoint to this workflow'
        - relatedly, the 'meaning ratio' of a graph is a useful structure to identify, as in 'what ratio of possible connections on this graph are true/useful/otherwise meaningful (do variables like position/structure all reflect relevant connections or is it only one type of structure that reflects relevant connections)', which is useful to identify 'limits on relevance of a graph and other required graphs' to completely identify the relevance of a connection set
        - relatedly, 'causal graph sequences' applied to 'error types' can be useful (to connect error type graphs in a sequence/stack that can identify causality between error types, so that for example when a cost is not an error but a solution, that aligns with other error type graphs, and when errors like costs can be added to create an error on some other error type graph, that is reflected in their structure/alignment), and same for solution (or mixed error/solution) similarity/type graphs, which is useful to connect to the 'stack of similar system layer diagrams applied to different interface structures (like functions or problem types)' since a similarity graph sequence can be a causal graph sequence, and relatedly, applying causal graphs to other graphs to identify variants of useful graphs like 'cross-interface type variants of the uncertainty relevance graph' like how an 'inner layer of structures can cause an outer layer of abstractions' is similarly useful

    - identifying useful structures like 'networks of structures like "buffers" of interface structures like "variation", organized by relevance like intent/usefulness' that are useful for intents like 'filtering useful graphs'
        - for example, a description of a neural network can be 'a static network of sequences, with a buffer of variation that allows for flexibility in alternate structures of inputs like "combinations of inputs" bc of the higher node count and variable function allowing this variation', where alternatives to this 'variation buffer' can involve implementing interface structures with these structures like useful 'positions/combinations/connection functions'
        - relatedly, variables/variants of the 'uncertainty relevance spectrum graph' can be useful, like 'type similarity-based spectrums of the interface graph variants, like where the type similarity is alternately applied as an application/embedding/input/structure of the graph', or where the 'function implemented by a change in the graph' isnt a value change like 'opposite' but a function like 'connect/reduce/filter', so that changing to the opposite side of the graph connects/reduces/filters the original structure, or where different pairs of error/solution types are applied as variable connections like 'layers of the graph', and connecting these graph variants can identify useful patterns like where 'error/solution types have similar structure across variants' like where different sets of error/solution types involve 'solutions in the position of the average', where integrating these graphs as components/variables of another graph (with options like 'overlap/cluster/intersect by similarities') can identify a general error/solution type map
        - relatedly, applying similar graphs for different intents like 'applying the "system layer graph of interface structures" as a problem-type graph and as a maximal difference-generating graph and as an organizing similarity index graph' is useful as a base graph and also to 'create sets of graph variants by optimizing the base graph for these graph type intents'

    - identifying useful structures like 'structures of iterated/interface meanings of an intent (like connections to some base like a graph)' that can 'filter intent implementations'
        - for example, a graph of 'opposites on spectrums' is usable to solve problems like an 'extreme value on some spectrum' with intents like 'oppose a difference to solve the problem', with implementations of those intents like 'apply iterations of adjacent steps until the opposite is reached or until some ratio is reached that fulfills alternate solution metrics' or 'apply the opposite difference to neutralize the problem by adding it to its exact opposite difference', where these opposites are connectible when problematic bc they are already identified as connected/similar on that spectrum, so the 'meaning/relevance of an intent, based on some graph' has various optimal implementations which involve 'interface meanings of an intent' which can filter these implementations
            - this means creating alternate spectrums of other opposites like 'opposing iterations of interface structures' is a useful variant of that graph to generate other useful variants
            - as mentioned elsewhere, query implementations to check relevance of an interim solution to other problems or other solutions or problem-solving workflows can be integrated with each graph
                - this involves identifying intents that should be implemented simultaneously, like 'apply some query implementation to solve the problem' while also 'checking for interactivity with relevant query parameters like crossing common/general optimization ratios, given the meaning of the current position in the graph at this point in the iteration/implementation'
            - relatedly, identifying 'extrapolations/extensions in meaning' of a problem/solution structure (like a query), like the 'determining/invalidating variables or implications of a query in some base system' or the 'intents relevant to a query' are useful 'sequences/networks of a problem/solution structure (like a query)' to identify, which are useful to connect in a graph (allowing relevant structures like 'overlaps/iterations'), where the query is a different base to apply interface networks around, as opposed to intents/workflows
        - relatedly, the graph of 'meaning-determining changes, given some variable/network/base' (as in 'the meaning of this structure, given this graph') is a new graph to apply to optimize queries with relevance metrics, to identify useful bases to solve problems
        - relatedly, identifying 'unconnected variables' on a graph and applying 'adjacent unconnected variables' is an example of another 'metric-prioritized query on a graph', where identifying the meaning of this 'metric-prioritized query on a graph' is useful to create indexes/networks of these
        - relatedly, graph layers like 'required specific errors to avoid across graphs' are useful to identify and apply to each graph, and graphs of 'determining structures' like 'unique/required structures in common systems' are similarly useful to graph, and connect to graphs of other similar interface structure to identify new similarities/differences in these base similarities

    - identifying useful structures like 'integratable interface structure sequences' that are useful to integrate in networks
        - for example, a network of intents to connect intents/queries/similarities/graphs is useful, like how solving two 'type connection problems' at once can be solved by abstracting them with an abstract graph of type connections, after which integrating another base like a query/solution metric like 'a graph that enables/optimizes for shortest path queries' can be integrated with another abstraction/specification/other interface change, which is a useful intent sequence to identify (such as 'first solve the high priority problems like "multi-functionality" with abstraction, then solve the lower priority problems like optimizing for solution/query metrics with specification of the abstract graph to offset the abstraction') as well as identifying the 'networks of these sequences', which is bc 'relevant requirements' are a useful structure to filter graph query/solution metrics that are irrelevant for some requirement/intent
        - relatedly, iterations/loops of sequences like 'problem/intents-similarities-graphs-queries/solutions' are useful to combine/integrate/optimize for bc the 'intent represents the difference to resolve, which identifies similarities that would be useful to create a graph that can resolve those differences with queries' (which is like a 'problem difference-opposing/connecting similarity for that difference-similarity set/embedding-similarity usage' sequence), which should be integrated with interface functions like 'abstraction/specification' (like 'check for an abstraction that could optimize this "problems/intents-similarities-graphs-queries/solutions" sequence for multiple/sequential intents'), which enables queries like 'given the similarity (like an intersection) between these intents (on some intent graph), what similarities between graph-generating similarities could fulfill both intents (connect both differences)'

    - identifying useful structures like 'different graph variables (like "mixes of maximally different partitions of problem types with useful variation like frequency, across some variable like graph layer")' to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'identify new graphs'
        - for example, a graph of different partitions/bases of problem types could start with different layers as core layers like 'filtering/connection/generation problems' vs. 'interface/causal/logic problems' vs. 'specific interface structure like requirement problems' vs. 'relevance/comparison/meaning problems', where different core layers are useful for different intents/workflows and problem distributions/variables and which can be usefully varied like with frequency (like applying the most common item of each partition in the core layer and applying this frequency spectrum across layers)
        - relatedly, a graph with 'similarities/differences or other maximally different variable sets on different axes' is likely to be useful for identify new useful connections across maximally different variables with query structures like 'right angles'
        - relatedly to 'combining connections (like adding facts)', the structure of 'adding a general connection and multiple specific contradictory connections' does not equal one definitive meaning like 'negated correlation (as in a lack of correlation)', but does equal a "network including a set of alternative 'relevance/meaning structures of the addition/combination' which have spectrums like 'truth' embedded in this network" (including a 'possible negated correlation' and a 'general connection which is changing therefore it has a few contradictions' and so on which have variable truth that can be organized in a spectrum), where 'all useful relevance structures like relevance networks of additions/combinations' can be identified, similar to how 'all possible useful ambiguity resolutions between interface structures' can be identified, and similarly, 'iterating connections (multiplying facts)' has relevance structures like 'creating copies of units for build intents' or 'a certainty level (on a certainty spectrum) which increases with iterations/repetitions'
        - relatedly, resolving irrelevant comparisons (like between relatively unrelated variables like 'when the ratio of relatively irrelevant variables like simplicity to abstraction is high, what relevant structures occur?') is useful to identify relevance-increasing structures and identify the connections between irrelevant variables and relevance

    - identifying useful structures like 'sufficient variation to be relevant to some intent' which identifies a 'new useful graph to connect relevant structures'
        - for example, by applying the spectrum of 'extremity/average' to over-prioritization errors on the outer layer of the 'uncertainty relevance graph', 'possible structures with sufficient variation to overlap with different structures than errors (as in solutions)' can be identified (given the similarity in extremity between different errors, applying an average to this extremity is sufficient variation to identify non-errors as in solutions), which identifies 'sufficient variation to be relevant to some intent (like "identifying useful differences like solutions")' as a useful structure to graph, since the 'ratios required for relevant variation for some intent' would likely be possible and useful to identify in a graph
            - similarly, 'parallel spectrums/similarities that overlap with some error structures' might also be enough sufficient variation to identify useful differences like solutions
            - relatedly, predicting that two extreme errors could be usefully connected with a circle, having sufficient variation in the 'error type' (over-prioritization error) to fill the whole structure of a circle, is useful to identify after identifying at least two errors of the same type on some graph, so that the 'possibility of sufficient variation in that circle' can be identified as a possible structure containing differences like solutions
        - relatedly, the problem of 'identifying a base to start combining/filtering from, to generate a set of rules that "solves all problems" as in "explains reality"' can be improved with 'relevance structures like relevance combination functions' like how once a useful structure to re-combine/filter is identified, that is integrated into the combination/filter function as the new base for example, which involves a 'relevance check function' to identify whether there is a new base to iterate or a new direction to apply changes in or whether a new combination type is useful, such as 'embedded combinations on some structure resulting from previous combinations', which is a useful alternative to 'generating all possible interface structure combinations and filtering those combinations' (which is related to the problem of whether a graph or its applications are the more useful representation of the interaction like the correlation represented in that graph)
            - this intent of 'generating rules to explain reality' can be fulfilled by starting with a base of 'problem types' (as in combining relevant structures like 'problem types'), which are a default relevance structure that covers high variation which is useful to start combinations/filters from, and similarly, 'making it certain that this generator/filter will intersect with identified true rules or their approximations/specifications/generalizations/etc at some point (as opposed to first)' is another generative/filter priority which can be fulfilled by identifying 'approximations/specifications/format standardizations of identified rules' and then identifying their similarities to identify a useful graph of these rules (with optional steps like connecting this graph to problem types, the maximal variation that is already identified/connected) and then identifying a useful direction to generate that graph from to solve some problem, like a direction which likely contains the variation to solve some unsolved problem (like how connecting this graph to inputs related to smaller/maximally different input variables like smaller components can identify rules of 'subatomic/quantum physics'), where these 'graph interaction graphs' are useful to identify and optimize interactions of
        - relatedly, identifying 'meaningful standardization of queries' to identify the 'interface intents of queries' like the 'correct/intended structures of specificity (using interface structures like frequency/context) for some overly general query' is a useful metric for neural networks (can it infer the specific intent intended by some overly general query using context or frequency of common queries, for example)
        - relatedly, identifying 'relevant comparisons between iterated interface structures' is a useful similarity to base a new graph on, where the graph will resolve ambiguities between interface structures (like identifying all the ways/cases that a common pattern will be relevant, vs. all the ways/cases an abstract similarity will be relevant instead)

    - identifying useful structures like the 'relevance of query structures' that can fulfill intents like 'filtering graphs'
        - for example, identifying the 'relevance of interface structures (like query structures)' like 'any straight line on a graph' is useful to identify, where straight lines are rarely useful except in simpler graphs to connect differences like 'items on different layers', and where 'straight lines can represent useful queries in a graph that allows iteration' but this format also removes info like 'how direction changes can encode info about similarities/differences (like difference types) or different bases to apply in queries'

    - identifying useful structures like 'interface variables like specificity of relevance structures required to solve a problem (to identify specific relevance structures as useful)' is useful for intents like 'filter solution sets'
        - for example, identifying 'specificity/volatility of relevance required to solve a problem' (such as interface structures like 'specificity of relevance structures like definitions/comparisons/ratios/info/variation' like whether generally/specifically useful/relevant structures are required/relevant) is a structure that can be applied to identify certainty/specificity structures of a problem, where similarly identifying the opposite (like 'uncertainty structures') can also identify un/certainty structures of a problem
        - relatedly, identifying the 'similarity/difference structures that are relevant to problem/solution structures' identifies the complete set of workflows (like how the similarity of a 'possibilities (solution set)' to a solution since it will inevitably contain the solution, and the difference of 'iterations of the solution set' to the solution and the similarity in the 'solution metric' to the solution that is applied to filter/test each solution create the workflow of 'trial and error', as in applying a 'solution type similarity, an iteration difference, then a solution metric similarity' which is a simple set of interface similarities/differences that maps to the workflow, as in asking questions like 'whats a way to use type similarities to solve a problem? by applying it to solution type similarities as in possibilities' for all interface structure combinations applied to problem/solution structures), which is useful to integrate with interface layers like 'intent layers' (like 'what intents are fulfilled by this similarity sequence')
        - relatedly, rather than 'ratios on a spectrum of volatility', 'networks of structures of volatility at specific ratios' are a better representation of volatility in most problem-solving processes, since one dimension is usually insufficient (spectrums might be sufficient, if usefulness structures like 'multiple' and 'interactive' are applied, to create for example the 'uncertainty relevance intersecting interface variable graph', which is a way to generate useful graphs, by applying usefulness structures like 'interactivity' to interface structures like 'spectrums' of interface variables like 'specificity', where these are useful structures bc of the similarities/differences they encode like how 'multiple' encodes a 'similarity' and 'interactive' encodes a 'similarity (which is useful to identify between differences like in the uncertainty spectrum graph)')
        - relatedly, the workflow of 'create changes up to a useful point to identify new relevant structures, then fit to a similarity index network to standardize/organize it to check that its really new/relevant as in generally new/relevant' can be usefully varied like 'identify spectrums that extend beyond already used values which connect some set of values on the similarity index network, either a new/identified spectrum, to identify the limits of change in some variable/direction, then apply maximal differences as in the limit of that variable, which is likely to create generally new/relevant changes, based on the ratio of difference to the limit between un/used structures'

    - identifying useful structures like 'workflow-optimized networks implementing relevant spectrums to optimize a graph for an intent sequence' which are useful for identifying useful variants of workflows like 'optimized intent sequences, given some available graphs'
        - for example, identifying 'networks of useful structures' to embed at a point in the 'uncertainty relevance intersecting interface variable graph' to reduce problems to the intent sequence of 'identify conceptual requirements (like the average of simplicity/complexity) to identify a useful point on that uncertainty graph' and then 'identify a useful workflow input (like a base) structure in the network associated with that level of simplicity at that point to apply as a workflow input (like a base solution)' where this network associated with each point has a 'useful structure' for each core problem-solving intent, which applies a 'specification spectrum' to optimize this graph for this problem-solving intent sequence
            - this can be applied to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'identifying useful similarities (like patterns/intersections/averages) between similarities in useful structures' which have clear conceptual requirements like 'average complexity as opposed to extreme simplicity' (as in 'graphs of useful cross-interface queries wont involve extremely simple similarities (like the same positions/shapes of queries on each interface)', which would be too simple to cover the complexity/variation of useful interface queries), and this graph can be optimized for fulfilling these problem-solving intents (not only are the networks associated with each point optimized for problem-solving intents but the points on the graph are optimized for these intents, like prioritized as starting/base points for problem-solving intents/workflows)
            - this applies spectrums like 'specification' while also applying other sequences like workflow-implementing graph sequences

    - identifying useful structures like 'new ways to apply graphs/bases/combinations in structures' that are useful for 'identifying similarities in another useful structure like queries'
        - for example, identifying 'sets/similarities of base sets' to create graphs based on those 'similarities between graph sets' is useful, like identifying a pair of graphs that are useful to apply in a combination (like the 'uncertainty/relevance spectrum graph and the sets of spectrum networks required to implement core functions which are related graphs') and another pair of graphs that is related to this pair of graphs, to identify useful iterated/embedded variants of 'graph sequences' like 'base graph set sequences', where 'queries between one graph set' is useful to follow with 'queries between the next graph set'
        - relatedly, applying interface variables as different base structures like 'upper/lower ranges' is useful to identify for example 'connections between interface variables of different scales' like identifying info that can be identified by applying differences between bases like abstraction and relevance (applied as range limits), and similarly, identifying structures like 'applying bases as sides of closed shapes' as useful to identify 'query patterns involving those base structures' is a useful connection to identify, which is like 'applying a few constant connections as vector sets or corners of a graph, in between which other parameters/connections can vary' in that it applies a certainty as a structure so that uncertainties can be resolved
        - relatedly, a 'semantically distant or specific structural prompt' is an example of a metric of AI models, where all the value is in the prompt, as opposed to the model in 'models requiring high semantic distance or specific structural prompts', which is similar to a language, where all the value is in an invention specification, rather than in the language network
        - another solution metric for the completion of intents like 'problem-solving' is a graph where connections between structures are clearly mappable to some set of connection structures (a graph where any hypothesized connection or question about a connection can be answered with some set of n connection structures like graphs/algorithms that are clearly structured and therefore automatically findable) which hasnt happened yet bc no complete set of usefully relevant (such as specific, cross-interface) structures (like matrix-maps and algebra connection formats and problem type fields and so on) has been graphed/structured yet, but once that occurs, these structures will be clearly combinable/connectible to connect any hypothesized connection between variables (which will identify new problem types as unsolved)

    - identifying useful structures like 'integrations between iterations of interface structures that are relevant to useful structures' like how to apply 'required interactions and core function implementations with useful structures like interface variable spectrums'
        - for example, identifying 'different graphs and what structures they interact with (like what queries/implementations they enable/simplify)' is useful, like how '"overlapping spectrums of interface variables" can identify useful function implementations' (like how spectrum variables like 'clarity/specification/constants' can overlap to implement the 'find/filter function'), and how a "spectrum like 'abstraction' can implement an 'abstract (as in create/increase abstraction) function' by identifying structures related to its definition higher/lower on the spectrum and connections between these structures", and how a 'find function can be implemented by sequences of similarities between interface variables like how abstractions can identify patterns/similarities, so a sequence of abstraction-patterns/similarities exists in this specific find function implementation, which can be implemented as a network or as with sequences as connections between parallel vertical interface variable spectrums (to implement a horizontal clarity/obscurity as in a "find" spectrum, or a set of horizontal stacked spectrums that increase clarity like specification/difference)', and how a 'set of overlapping spectrums can create a useful structure like a closed shape that can be useful for queries within that shape such as "queries between limits/bases where resulting angles (like angle of impact) determine the next useful structures to apply", where the overlaps occur at relevant points to specify important interactions (like required interactions or other limits of interactions)'
        - I thought of this when I noticed the alignment between intent graphs in cardinal directions like 'find/obscure, generate, and apply' and the 'uncertainty/relevance interface variable spectrum intersection graph' and when thinking about what other useful core graphs might be identifiable, so I thought about how to integrate those and apply find/generate/apply as spectrum variables and what other graphs of spectrums might be useful (like the overlapping spectrums that can implement 'find')
        - relatedly, a reason why I havent stopped applying interface analysis to identify new useful structures is that I know algorithms cant generate this yet and I know why ('generating a picture of a new useful graph' requires concepts to be adjacent which arent adjacent in any algorithm except an interface analysis-based algorithm bc only relevant variables like interface variables can adjacently generate the concepts required to create new useful/relevant graphs, for example as to why a 'graph pixel-generating algorithm' wont be implemented optimally with existing machine learning algorithms/network architectures/parameters and why you incorrectly thought it would be able to, which is related to the fact that the 'pixels meaning' isnt encoded/derivable with existing data/algorithms bc they dont have understanding of meaning built-in)
            - similarly, the work of 'creating new workflows' is related to identify new different interface structures and identifying new connections between these new structures which havent been connected before with identified useful structures (so the problematic structures like new 'problem-solving graphs/problem-solving intents' havent been identified before, and their connection also hasnt been identified before, and the frame/perspective of the structures is also new, which is like changing all interface variables at once)

    - identifying useful structures like 'complete sets of implementation variants' that can invalidate other required problem-solving intents like 'identify new variants of implementations of a core function like add/filter for new structures'
        - for example, identifying the 'add globally' vs. 'add structure (like add value)' vs. 'add a specific definition/component of the structure' variants of addition function implementations is a way to identify a 'complete implementation set of a function (with related implementation formats/graphs/definitions)' that invalidates the requirement to 'identify new meanings of addition for new structures/formats/definitions'
        - relatedly, adding connections/structures 'once theyre formatted in a format (like vectors) where addition is already defined' may be useful in some cases, but in other cases there is a requirement or relevant intent to identify a new addition implementation or a new addable format, in between the definition of the connections/structures to be added and existing addable formats, which is a useful base set to connect

    - identifying useful structures like 'connection structures between bases to optimize some solution metric (like pre-computation as in computing inputs before theyre required)' to fulfill intents like 'filter interface queries/structures'
        - for example, identifying 'what bases should be generated in what connection type' (like whether bases like 'what is testable/measurable/analyzeable' should be generated first before generating bases like 'structures to test/measure/analyze') and 'whether these bases should be in what ratio/position/sequence/other structure' (like whether 'what is testable' should be identified some ratio of variation ahead of 'tests generated or structures to test') can identify 'optimizations to sequences of intents to fulfill', which can filter 'interface queries and other iterations of interface structures', as a way to determine how new relevance should be generated/identified
        - the reason this is useful is that its not obvious/trivial that there is a 'specific ratio of variation' between these related bases that could create a solution structure like a 'variation/accuracy buffer' and if there is a useful ratio (like a 'specific ratio') that is identifiable without extreme testing/filtering, this ratio can determine a high ratio of interactions given the generality of the structures involved
        - relatedly, the 'ratio/structure of variation across interfaces or in some degree/type/structure' that is 'required to enable/guarantee/invalidate relevance' is useful as a general intent to fulfill to identify/generate new relevant structures
        - relatedly, another reason why the over-prioritization errors of the 'uncertainty/relevance interface variable intersection graph' are incorrect is that errors of 'extreme abstraction/specification' imply obvious error connections (like 'everything is equal/different' which are useful to apply as limits/extremes of a range') which identify 'similarities between spectrums' like 'abstraction/specification' and 'constant/variation' which are reflected in another graph (the 2-d concept cluster network), which connects these graphs in a useful way, where applying logical connections to extend these implications are useful to identify other errors/solutions
        - relatedly, the intent of 'adding/combining facts/connections' is related to identifying the 'standards (and associated graphs) that generate sufficient similarities that the connections become addable/combinable', identifying a 'definition of addition/combination that identifies these standards' (same for other functions like 'compositions/convolutions'), which involves identifying the 'connection-relevant definition' of addition that relates to 'connections between scalars' rather than 'scalars', and the same for other structures to add like 'graphs' (identifying the 'graph-relevant definition' and related standards of that definition to create relevant similarities required for addition)

    - identifying useful structures like 'workflow-optimized graphs' (that have a workflow built-in or otherwise integrated to the graph like where the graph is optimized for the workflow) is useful for problem-solving intents like 'identify relevant graphs to solve a problem'
        - for example, identifying the 'graph that optimizes for a specific workflow like "trial and error" for a problem structure (like a problem type)' is useful, such as a 'graph with similar possible solutions pre-filtered with variables like by type' that makes the workflow faster to implement and other optimizations like 'graphs that optimize for multiple workflows or multiple problem types', where 'similarity in position on a graph' acts like a filter
        - relatedly, identifying 'abstract/interface graph filters' is useful, so that a set of graphs with different 'core/embedded/emergent/generative similarities' can be filtered by abstract relevance or other interface structure relevance, like how a 'subset of graphs with some core similarities' is likelier to be useful for solving a problem type or general problem-solving intent (as in 'abstract relevance')
        - relatedly, 'identifying relevant graphs' can be implemented by identifying 'connections between variable correlations' (if this graph between these variables has this correlation shape, then this graph between other variables will be useful at intents like 'identifying relevant differences' for a data set, given some conceptual/structural connection between the variable sets), so that 'identifying useful correlations/similarities to start with, that identify the most other relevant similarities for an intent', is possible to implement with those starting similarities

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between general solution metrics and structural reasons for those metrics' which is useful for problem-solving intents like 'identifying relevant graphs'
        - for example, identifying the "ratios that cause solution metrics like 'meaning' to be useful", such as the 'relatively high ratio of distribution of randomness vs. organization, compared to a more balanced ratio that aligns with uncertainty structures like uncertainty areas', which is relevant for problem-solving intents like 'identifying relevant graphs to solve a problem'
            - similarly, 'abstraction' is useful bc of the 'lack of info about patterns/similarities' and over-specific info ('excess info about specific connections'), which identifies a 'limit to the usefulness of abstraction' (when useful balances are identified between abstract/specific structures for all problem-solving intents, new solution metrics will be useful than abstraction, and the same applies to 'meaning')
        - relatedly, useful structures to identify include the 'relevant meaning of a query/similarity/graph in a graph' to identify other useful structures like a 'relevant difference to apply to a graph (to identify useful new variation)' such as a 'relevant difference to apply to a complete graph of problem types to solve the problem of "identifying a graph to solve all problems"' (as in 'given that this complete graph includes all problem types and there are no uncovered gaps between types bc the types represent all the interface variables that can cause problems, what differences like direction/position/specification can be applied to this graph to optimize it to handle more new relevant variation')
        - relatedly, identifying 'integrations between graphs of specific problems' is useful to identify different problem-solving graphs, which is a useful opposing intent (a 'filtering graph intent', filtering the graph by connecting specific graphs) to 'generative graph intents' (which generate/optimize a simple base graph)
        - relatedly, identifying 'similarities/errors/interface structures of interface structures' is useful for 'identifying relevant interface structures' like how a 'graph of graphs' and a problem-solving intent like 'identify new/relevant graphs' or 'organize graphs in a new useful way' have a similarity in that they both involve 'graphs', so a new 'graph of graphs' is probably relevant to those problem-solving intents, which is a way to automate 'identifying new useful inteface structures' (which can be optimized with standard optimizations like 'identify graphs that are relevant to multiple/common/useful/interactive problem-solving intents or problem-solving graphs or problem-solving workflows') and which can be specified with problem-solving intents like 'identify errors of interface structures like "missing interface structures", given this graph of interface structures, based on this similarity between interface structures'

    - identifying useful structures like 'different formats of useful structures' that are useful for different intents like 'identifying new similarities/patterns in queries to filter queries'
        - for example, separating graphs/queries is useful to identify 'query fields/other shapes' that likely have different patterns/similarities than the graphs those queries are run on where different useful graphs can be created from the query sequences (once standardized into a combinable format), so optimizations like 'group frequently used nodes in similar positions' can be applied to 'query fields of query sequences' in addition to the graph itself, which can be used to integrate these optimizations to create new graphs with new associated optimized query fields, which are graphs that may enable functions like 'combining graphs/queries'
            - this involves identifying query shapes like vacillations like 'low-high-medium' and possible uses of these queries like 'identifying an average', which can be applied to identify relevantly similar graphs to apply like 'adjacent graphs within some relevant variation range'
        - relatedly, identifying graph base structures like 'different sets of graphs to apply as bases for queries' (like 'queries should vacillate between these base graph sets') is useful to identify useful 'graph configurations on graphs of graphs'

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph query integrations that generate/identify relevance/meaning structures' is useful for intents like 'identify/filter interface queries'
        - for example, identifying different integrations of results from different graphs into different types/structures of relevance/meaning is a useful way to connect graphs in a network of graphs (with rules like 'generally true on this graph and consistent with this graph is an approximation of relevance structures like truth')
            - relatedly, given that relevance structures are 'connection structures like comparisons/combinations', combining/adding relevance structures like 'relevance types' (like abstract similarities, usefulness/meaning structures, truth structures, etc) involves identifying combinable structures, similarities preserved by these combinations, and limits to relevance (as in 'what is the upper/lower range on how relevant can a set of factual connections be when combined')
        - relatedly, identifying problems like 'misalignments/conflicts in abstract similarities like problem-solving intents' is useful for 'identifying new useful structures' (like solutions to those problems, like graphs that support multiple intents equally well)

    - identifying useful structures like 'useful intent sequences' and 'incomplete intents that are optimized by some application of some new useful structure (like a recently identified graph/standard)' (where completeness is identified by application to optimize other useful graphs for problem-solving intents)
        - for example, identifying 'where/how a standard should be applied', so that 'identifying new interface standards' (a standard like a 'new graph to standardize/integrate interface structures to/with') involves 'applying that new interface standard to all relevant graphs to optimize them for that standard' (like the graph of 'networks of workflows/problem types/problem-solving intents/other interface structures') in the correct position with the correct method to optimize that graph for 'some ratio of problem-solving intents', as well as default intents applied after 'identifying new interface standards' (default intents like 'identifying interface structures of that standard to create an interface network of that standard'), to apply problem-solving intents to graph interactions
            - rather than iterating to create this graph (iterating similarities/variables to create a sequence like 'type-relevance networks' as in networks of functions/workflows/problem-solving intents, then 'relevant types-relevance networks' as in 'networks of requirements/intent networks or workflow/intent networks', then 'intent-relevance networks' as in 'networks of structures useful for problem-solving intents'), identifying relevant similarities to apply as core similarities of this graph of graphs is useful to optimize the organization of this graph
            - relatedly, identifying a 'reduction of the current graph (like an abstraction of the current graph) in a way that identifies another useful structure (like an interface or graph of graphs)' is like 'removing a base as a starting point for a connection while creating the connection to another base and moving to the other base' (which is like "viewing an entangled particle pair connection without damaging it")
            - relatedly, identifying different 'abstract similarity' structures like an 'area containing a solution' and a 'base (similarity) for changes to be applied to' is useful as a way to identify their solutions/connections using abstract info structures (identifying where a 'solution area or a data set or a solution function set or solution function generator/variables or solution component/limit/concept' is usable instead of a 'specific solution function' is possible where abstract similarities are identified so their interactions like 'similarities/overlaps' can be identified)
            - relatedly, identifying the 'limits of specificity and limits of general solution metrics like reusability' is useful since these havent been identified yet, and identifying these limits will help 'identify new solution metrics', such as by identifying 'all the useful specific structures for generating reusability in a reusability network' (which will help identify other new metrics by what doesnt match anything on this network or other general solution metric networks), and similarly, identifying the 'limits of uncertainties that are useful to compute (or compute up to, like what are the most uncertain unidentified connections and which ones can feasibly be computed and are useful to compute or compute inputs to)' is useful as a 'directing/filtering force on problem-solving processes and a useful base to compare solutions/problems to'
        - relatedly, identifying 'which other graphs (or what variation of graphs) a graph needs to be connected to, in order for its usefulness to be completely identified' is useful (once a 'workflow network' is identified/optimized, should it be standardized/connected/applied to which other graphs for its usefulness to be identified, and similarly, identifying what other metrics are more useful like 'number of iterations of graphs that havent changed in usefulness to problem-solving intents, by applying this graph as a standard or integrating this graph or connecting this graph')
        - relatedly, identifying 'independent problem-solving intents that a graph hasnt been optimized for yet' is a useful function to apply to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation' (identifying 'unsolved problems like unoptimized problem-solving intents for a graph' is a source of new graph optimizations or new graphs) bc its a 'relevant difference (an unsolved optimization of some independent problem-solving intent) in an abstract similarity (like a problem-solving intent) of a structure (like a graph)', and similarly, identifying 'independent/indirect problem-solving intent sequences that are optimal to solve in that sequence' are useful to identify (intents that arent directly connectible by causal sequences but which are optimal to solve for some indirect/emergent interaction metric)

    - identifying useful structures like 'interim intents between adjacent graphs in a generated relevant sequence' (which is useful for 'identifying the limits of usefulness of a graph') and other 'derivable graph structures that can be identified for a graph' to fulfill relevant graph intents like 'describe the possible interactions/optimizations of a graph'
        - for example, identifying the 'completeness metrics of a graph' (like 'when a graph has been optimally used or optimized for general problem-solving intents, given its possible variation'), 'ratio of changes applied, after which point a graph has already been optimally used' (the core similarities of a graph have supported all the emergent patterns/similarities of some variation level that are going to be identified in that graph, given the changes possible in that graph), and 'possible interim intents that can be fulfilled by a graph between the defined intents of a graph and the defined intents of the next logical graph in a useful sequence of generated graphs' are other interaction structures to generate/filter graphs by
        - this involves 'identifying graphs that are relevant' (so they can be connected and that connection can be used for workflows, if there is enough 'relevant variation' in the graphs and the graph connection), like graphs with similarities in base similarity or relevance to another graph (like how the 'next graph' after the 'uncertainty/relevance graph' might be the 'same graph with more allowed intersections than one intersection between spectrums' or the 'same graph with graph layers like concentric layers of errors/solutions or other solution patterns', and the 'next interface graph' would be the 'graph of graphs, with a graph layer applying the uncertainty/relevance graph'), which can be done for example by identifying 'differently useful graphs in a generated graph sequence', and by identifying graphs that are relevant, its possible to apply these as 'bases for change' in workflows, like "upper/lower ranges of graphs (or interface variables of graphs like 'intents enabled by that graph') which should be changed by being connected (to identify interim intents indicating the limit of usefulness for a graph, for example)"

    - identifying useful structures like 'relevant graph connections/applications like how uncertainty structures in specific graphs should have similarities with a general uncertainty graph like the uncertainty/relevance graph'
        - for example, applying the 'uncertainty/relevance area graph' to align other graphs' uncertainties (so that uncertain variables in other graphs like 'allowed possible interactions' or 'possible patterns in interactions' align with the uncertainty areas/positions in other graphs), which identifies 'relevant graphs to apply to filter other graphs', where the 'relevant intents to fulfill' (to identify relevant graph connections/applications) can be identified by applying general solution metrics like 'consistency' applied to graphs (consistency across graphs), so that specific solution structures for uncertainties can be identified (cross-interface variables are higher in uncertainty as opposed to one interface variable value like an extreme/over-prioritization error, so 'cross-interface variables' can be 'possible uncertainties in other graphs' to align uncertainty structures in a relevant way, for example)

    - identifying useful structures like 'new graphs to connect/optimize like error/solution-prioritizing graphs' as a way to fulfill intents like 'identify new complex difference connections (like connections between new interface variants of graphs or new optimizations of connections between graphs'
        - for example, identifying that a 'graph where errors are prioritized' (like with interface variables like 'incentivized/adjacency' applied to the error/solution structure) has a 'graph of its opposite/other differences like a solution graph where solutions are prioritized' and identifying 'which graph is better in a sequence of graph comparisons for some set of solution metrics' and identifying 'connections to change the error graph into the solution graph' and identifying 'optimizations of those graphs/their connections' (like optimal graphs between these solution/error graphs that are relevant to some other problem) is useful as a new way to connect abstract problem/solution structures like 'new graphs', and identifying 'optimal connections between optimizations' (like 'inputs to multi-graph optimizations') to predict what optimizations will be useful to apply in advance (by generating the errors conceptually first before encountering them emergently/unpredictably)
        - relatedly, identifying useful graph comparison structures like useful graph comparisons to apply in a sequence and in any case and as a starting point for other graph comparisons and as an embedding of other graph comparisons (all new graph comparisons should be integrated into a meaningful graph) are useful structures to identify/optimize
        - relatedly, identifying the useful set of graphs to solve a problem involves identifying the useful 'causal graph' (like the useful 'degree of causation to visualize/structure in a graph') and the useful graphs for 'testing a solution generated by causal graphs' (like how 'conceptual understanding graphs' are useful for identifying causes but its often more useful to apply multiple graphs to test a conceptual solution, like a 'reality simulation graph of agents, ratios of agents, multiple agent types, different resources/intents for different agents, different agent positions, etc'), as well as a useful integration graph to connect or organize other graphs, which may also be a testing graph (testing for consistency with other relevant graphs like base graphs, for example), which is possible bc of the alignment in the sequence of 'identifying/generating/testing' a connection that is enabled by these graphs (as in 'causing/fitting graphs' align with that sequence)

    - identifying useful structures like 'error structures of graphs and the opposing solution structures of these errors' to fulfill intents like 'identify new problem-solving intents/optimizations'
        - for example, identifying the full set of interface graphs that are useful for solving problems involves graphs like 'problem types/variables connected to solution types/variables' and 'problem types with workflows' and 'problem types with graphs' and 'abstract-specific problem spectrums' and 'graphs optimized for cross-interface connections like connections between workflows/intents/problem types' and 'graph organizing graphs' and identifying the optimal starting point for solving a problem on this complex network of graphs becomes the problem to solve, so that intents like 'identify equivalent alternate connections in this complex graph of graphs' (to organize it and optimize by similarities) is a useful problem-solving intent that will simplify the problem of 'solving problems on this graph'

    - identifying useful structures like specific variants of problem-solving intents that are relevantly useful like 'identifying useful interface variable values (like higher definition/informativity) that can be optimized for, given some input graph'
        - for example, if by 'overlapping a set of similar generated grids by some function', there was a 'grid of missing points', that is more useful to identify than any of the generated grids, bc the 'grid of missing points' is comparatively 'more defining' (relatively more extreme on some interface variable like 'definition' or 'informativity' or 'interactivity') and therefore more useful/relevant than the generated grids, which is useful as a problem-solving intent such as 'identify all the more useful structures (like a limiting grid of the complete generated grid set such as a grid of missing points) to identify on some interface variable, given some interface structure (like a grid-generating function)' which is a specific variant (with a related reason) of the intent to "identify more useful variants of a graph" or "identify useful structures like patterns that could be identified on a graph given some 'query/iteration/similarity'" or "identify defined useful structures (like optimizations) of a graph"
        - this involves deriving the idea of a 'more defining/higher information variant/structure' (the 'missing grid' is useful for identifying/defining information about the other grids, like their positions) of a graph (similar to deriving the idea of a pattern that might emerge in a graph) and identifies how to identify that relatively more defining/higher information graph from the input graph (how to identify the idea of a 'missing grid' as useful from the input grid or its input generating function, using 'higher definition/information' as a priority), like the idea of a 'graph that identifies information about the other graphs, like their positions, to some degree'
        - relatedly, identifying 'graphs that are useful for workflows and otherwise connecting useful graphs (solved/identified interface similarities) to workflows (useful function paths)' is useful, like how the 'standardized similarity index network' and the 'problem type/solution type network' is useful for workflows like 'change a base solution' and 'maximally different graphs' are useful for offsetting the randomness in 'trial and error' (where some differences relevant to the problem are pre-solved such as pre-filtered by the graph, such as how random differences are pre-solved to some degree by maximal differences on some interface metric like 'structural differences or cross-interface differences or general differences'), and otherwise identifying 'which graphs are useful to start from when implementing a workflow' (and other interface structures connecting graphs/workflows) is similarly useful
        - relatedly, identifying the 'problems that a graph solves' also involves identifying the conceptual errors like 'imbalances' that a graph solves (by applying a concept like 'balance' like how the uncertainty/relevance graph of intersecting interface spectrums solves the problem of 'balancing extremes of interface variables that create errors like over-prioritization errors'), so 'identifying graphs that solve conceptual/other interface problems' like 'gaps in concepts already identified by other graphs' and 'balance of power in interface variable values that should be balanced' and 'graphs of powerful interface variables like causative interface variables (involving networks to connect these interface variables to the problems/solutions they can cause)' is useful as a problem-solving intent, and generating graph-relevant intents related to these problem structures like 'balancing the full set of useful interface graphs' and what that means (as in 'how it interacts with other intents/structures/problems/workflows/graphs') is useful as a problem-solving intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph organization functions (like relative positions of adjacency/difference) that are optimized for useful structures like "sequences of intents related to a given implemented intent" and "interface graph variants of concept definitions"'
        - for example, once a concept like 'fairness' has been identified as useful to identify, identifying its 'definition that relates to interface graphs' (like how the 'interface network' is useful for defining 'fairness', so a 'system implementing fairness' will also apply 'potential' such as a 'state change sequence in response to a challenge, that is sufficient to identify potential') as well as the 'concept graph queries to identify other useful concepts and concept graphs, given one that is identified as useful' (like how the 'opposite of a concept can be useful for some intents (like limiting what is identified as a concept)', and how a 'graph of graphs for a concept (like a graph of fairness graphs) where adjacent graphs are optimized for maximally different intents' is useful to identify the 'useful fairness graph in a set/graph for an intent'), which identifies 'sequences of useful intents, once a given intent is already fulfilled' as a general problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, similarity between abstract descriptions like 'queries that identify concepts, from other concepts' and similarities to other descriptions ('queries that identify relevant concepts, given other relevant concepts') like 'diverging alignments' and identifying graphs that enable and preserve these similarities is useful for query optimization

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph generating metrics like cross-graph similarity metrics like "common connections"' to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'identifying useful graphs (like new graphs) or connection types (like stable connections)'
        - for example, identifying specific types of cross-graph similarities identifies 'common connections' as a 'similarity metric' that can act as a base for graphs (start generating a graph that includes the same connections as other graphs but connects them with different functions and in different structures like patterns), which identifies 'useful graphs' by the 'ratio of common connections' and identifies 'more stable connections' by the 'cross-multiple grpah connections', where 'networks of common connections' can be a useful 'connection type and a base for graphs'
        - relatedly, identifying optimizations like 'abstraction' which can be useful for multiple intents like 'multi-tasking' and 'storing more info' is useful to identify variables of optimizations like 'ratio/type of similarity' that is useful for multiple intents
        - relatedly, any general connection is useful to identify, if you also know the probability distribution related to the ratio of 'ways that its true/false' (or the 'general ratio' of ways that its true/false), as in its useful even if its true/false half the time or generally false, once you know that distribution or the general distribution (identifying ratios/networks/structures that can be useful even in their generally true or false forms, where a range of ratios/networks/structures is useful, is also useful)

    - identifying useful structures like the 'similarities and similarity-based queries that can connect relevant differences (like workflows/implementations)'
        - for example, identifying that the 'reduce' function has a similarity with the 'number of connections between variables' so that 'reducing a problem space/system or connection between problem/solution' can be done by identifying connections, which I thought when thinking about 'how to visualize solving a problem with a brain having fewer nodes than the problem' and identifying that 'number of connections' has a similarity with the 'reduce' function, so identifying all the interface variables like 'connection count' and their similarities with problem-solving intents/core functions/workflows is useful for identifying other similarities that are useful for identifying 'implementations/queries for a workflow'
            - relatedly, this 'similarity in variable count with reductions (reductions of variable counts)' can be used iteratively to identify 'abstract/standardized connection count' (which is probably fewer in variable count) to identify a 'query on a similarity index' (which involves one variable which is 'difference from other queries on the similarity index') as a 'useful sequence to apply in workflows'
        - relatedly, identifying new graphs is useful, like identifying 'graphs of connections between interface structures (like the "graph of uncertainty/relevance spaces in intersecting interface variable spectrums") and error graphs (like over-prioritization errors)' which identifies a graph of graphs connecting 'error types and interface structures that identify those error types', which I thought about when thinking about the 'graph of uncertainty/relevance spaces in intersecting interface variable spectrums' and a 'similar graph which is that graph that starts from a core layer of problem types and connects to solution types or specific solutions' and identifying that a 'graph to identify useful interface structures to identify an error type (or all error types)' wasnt identified yet, which identifies 'identify similar graphs and identify ways to integrate/merge them into fewer graphs or identify their position in a graph of graphs' as a useful problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying a standard/base graph (like a standard network of 'general connections between nodes') to start applying changes from to identify the 'correct variant for a problem or useful variants like interface variants' identifies a 'useful graph sequence to solve problems with' (variants like a network with 'at least one abstract/specific connection or other maximally different connection set' between nodes)

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs that are more useful the more theyre used like interface networks or uncertainty/relevance graphs or error type graphs' and 'useful functions to apply them iterately with (like iterate interface structures and identify error structures of that iteration with error graphs, then iterate that identification until interactions of the graph is identified)'
        - for example, identifying 'over-prioritization errors' in the 'uncertainty graph of intersecting interface spectrums' is useful for identifying 'similarities/limits/errors between interfaces' like 'centers (and other common bases) of value references like averages/extremes of interface spectrums', which identifies a useful 'direction of change' to increase relevance, and its useful to apply this graph iteratively to identify over-prioritization errors and other error structures caused by iterated interface structures like graphs (identify 'over-prioritization errors' of iterated interface structures like 'abstract requirements' or 'graphs of graphs' as opposed to just 'extremes of interface spectrums like high ratios of abstraction') to identify new similarities/limits/errors of iterated interface structures, which is a 'graph that becomes more useful the more often its applied', which is a useful type of structure to identify (and then identify examples/variables/limits of)
        - relatedly, 'identifying missing specifications/interface structures of graphs' is useful as a problem-solving intent and relatedly 'identifying the limits of specification/embedding/iteration that can be usefully applied to a graph before it connects to other useful structures' is a useful intent related to graph optimization, like how the 'upper range limit of common useful structures (like vitamins/minerals) used in specific ways (like inhaled in a specific format)' is a missing specification on a 'graph of useful interactions/usages of vitamins/minerals' (as in 'the graph can be specified further until the usage upper range limit in a more complete ratio of core formats is identified', after identifying that the 'ratio of core format interactions identified' is relatively low, compared to other identified ratios), which identifies 'comparisons comparisons (like core interaction ratio comparisons)' as a useful structure to identify useful structures like areas to apply specification in

    - identifying useful structures like 'alternate inputs of relevance like conflicts (and how these structures can be relevant to graphs)'
        - for example, identifying graphs that conflict or oppose each other in some way (like when these graphs are applied repeatedly in this system, they oppose or generate opposition to each other) is useful to identify conflicts as a source of relevance (graphs that generate conflicts are more relevant bc conflict is relevant)
            - this is bc conflicts that are unresolved are a 'source of variation' which is relevant to problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation' and also bc conflicts that are unresolved indicate 'relevance' in the form of 'equivalence between the conflicting structures' (which relates to uncertainties, bc uncertainties are unresolved conflicts)
            - this indicates that the point where 'relevance is irrelevant' is where relevance is solved bc conflicts/differences are solved (no differences are not adjacently connectible) bc conflicts are solved (such as 'there are no equivalent opposing entities to create conflicts') and 'optimizations are solved' (all optimizations have been identified, as in 'no more conflicts are necessary') 'intents are solved' (no differences are unresolved, so no desires are unmet) bc optimal understanding is identified, at a point where computation still allows conflicts (more graph of graph iterations can be computed by different opposing computers), so if alternate opposing equivalent computers (like a computer that uses a different interface) are possible, conflict is possible

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph usages (like the 2-d concept cluster graph and intent sequences using connections of interface variables) that can implement some useful intent like "identifying structures to connect each workflow to interface variables (like volatility)"' and generally fulfill problem-solving intents like 'ways to apply/integrate graphs to implement/identify problem-solving intents'
        - for example, identifying 'ways to use each interface variable (like change interface variables like volatility) in each workflow' (to solve the problem of 'identifying volatility relevance') like 'creating stability (by removing volatility from problem/solution definitions/requirements which should be stable) for workflows involving certainty structures like requirements' and 'creating generality (like in a correlation function where the data set is balanced between volatility/linearity)' is a useful intent, to identify the graph of optimal interface variable interactions to filter intents by useful sequences like 'identify volatility, to identify stability/generality' (which can be usefully specified with interface structures connected by these variables), which can use the '2-d cluster graph of concepts by similarity' to implement this intent automatically (identify which structures are certainty structures like 'requirements' or which have variable interactions of certainty like 'should optimally/could usefully/would conditionally' be certainty structures and change them to be more certain by adding certainty structures)
            - another example of a useful graph interaction is applying a 'interface spectrum intersection graph' to the 'general relevance area graph (between linearity/randomness)' or 'applying the abstract-specific graph to the concept ring graph', which is a useful specification to identify 'concept combinations and over-simplifications' as useful structures to 'specify relevance in relevance areas', as well as identifying useful graph integration/application/connection interaction rules (like applying graphs with complementary variation and no irrelevant interactions in their integrated variant)
        - relatedly, identifying graphs (like graphs of 'ratios/thresholds required to build one interface structure from another') connecting each interface structure set (with find/build intents) is another useful graph specification to identify of the general 'workflow function connection graph of interface structures'
        - relatedly, identifying graphs to completely define/identify volatility (allowing parameters to vary around its certain specific definitions or vary in directions of uncertainty, and identifying filters of useful graphs like 'only the extreme correlations between volatility or its components and other interface variables') is a useful intent to simplify identifying volatility and other interface variables by default (when volatility is identified, other variables related to it are also identified as ir/relevant)
        - relatedly, 'relevance' and 'meaning/interactivity' are connected by their functionality to 'encode comparisons' (relevance according to some connection to a base that it interacts with, and interactivity as a structure of relevance/interaction with some base like an interface variable)
        - relatedly, identifying 'points on a graph of concepts' to identify 'whether some structure could possibly contain relevant differences between these concepts (in another graph)' is an example of a 'useful sequence of graph intents' ('identify a core similarity and identify differences that could confirm/invalidate that core similarity on other relevant graphs' or 'identify a graph where points are similar to identify if thats a useful general base graph to base "queries for differences in other graphs" on')
        - identifying 'requirements of functions (like add/combine/reduce/filter)' to identify 'requirements for facts/connections that can be operated on (like added)' has structures like 'having some similarity like type (similar to how numbers with similar types can be combined/added/otherwise interacted with to create another number of that type)' so that there is a clear standard created by that similarity that allows the definition of 'add' to be relevant to those structures (involving identifying 'graphs where that type of change is supported', like an 'abstract-specific graph where connection types like "details" can be added with surrounding connections'), and similarly, identifying 'ways that values can increase by being posiitioned near each other in a graph' as a way to identify 'add' operation relevance for a system/concept is another example of defining core functions on different interfaces

    - identifying useful structures like 'possible patterns/similarities/alignments in graphs (based on some similarity to generate the graph, as a similarity that creates a difference in a graph) and what those patterns/similarities can be used for' to connect cross-interface structures (like patterns/intents) with graphs, based on what probable intents will be useful based on predictable problems (like how 'correlations between interface variables' are useful to predict and 'identify missing items in a set' is a way to predict structures, so this intent can be applied to generate a relevant graph that identifies patterns like 'angle differences' in a set of correlations to fulfill the intent of 'identifying missing items in a set')
        - for example, a relevant graph is 'similarities/alignments between graphs' (like all the volatility graphs where volatility is on the same axis) to identify patterns like 'there is always a set of positive/negative correlations covering most angles for a high variation variable like volatility' which can be used as a 'set pattern' for intents like 'identify the items in a set' (to identify missing correlations in a set of correlations for a high variation variable)
        - the problem-solving intent 'identify missing items in a set' is useful for 'predicting items in a set' which enables intents like 'identify relevant structures (like relevant sets) for a problem' (identify that there is a set of different angles to describe interface variable correlations given some similarity like a 'common axis') which identifies 'other information missing in other sets' (of which there are many other items than 'volatility' in the set of interface variables)
            - this means applying one set ('set of angle differences' between standardized correlations given some common axis, assuming there is a reason for this to be generally true across interface variables, which might not be true bc of independent variables that can invalidate a reason for that) can identify other items in a set (identifying missing angles/correlations in a set of other correlations in 'another interface variable') bc of the 'similarity in the set' of interface variables like the 'variation level'
            - this is possible bc identifying a 'pattern across these aligned interface variable graphs' allows 'identify missing items in a set' (and enabled intents like 'predicting items in a set' and 'predicting angles of interface variable correlations') to be a relevant intent, so 'identifying/connecting similarities (like patterns/alignments) in graphs with each other and with structurally/specifically relevant problem-solving intents enabled by those similarities' is a useful problem-solving intent (a general intent of 'identify possible similarities, then connect similarities across adjacent/otherwise relevant differences like types, then connect similarities to problem-solving intents related to problem differences like missing info/similarities')
            - this is relevant to 'applying similarities to find useful structures' or 'identifying structures like similarities that would be useful if they were relevant/true', but involves 'connecting them' with reasons for the useful structures to be relevant to some base similarity (reasons why a useful structure might be relevant to a specific graph)
            - this involves intents like 'identifying relevant similarities' (as in a 'relevant set/similarity with a pattern/similarity') as in 'identifying similarities enabled by other similarities' which identifies a problem-solving intent of 'identifying the most useful base similarities to apply as a base for a similarity index network'

    - identifying useful structures like 'metric types in graph (like suboptimal interim metrics in graphs)' and 'error comparison metrics possible in different graph' which are possible to identify/optimize
        - for example, identifying 'suboptimal interim metrics in graphs' is possible, such as how 'error graphs' are likely to have 'increasing error when errors combine to compound the error level' so that errors can be identified by 'error intersections/combinations' and a 'spectrum graph of error count' can be identified (which identifies 'increasing error level with increasing error count'), which leaves out info about possible contradictions identified with intents like 'identifying error combinations that decrease the error level', so a 'simple count metric' is insufficient to predict the 'error level inputs' (without identifying the complete graph or identifying/applying other intents that could change the metric), which I thought of when thinking about how errors (like crimes) can increase in the 'uncertainty graph of interface spectrums (where errors occur on the extremes)' and how some structures creating those increases are obvious like error intersections/combinations, and how a 'spectrum of increasing error combinations/counts to indicate increasing error level' would be generally useful but would miss complexities like where errors combine to create 'neutral/suboptimal/solution/other irrelevant structures' (like where specific errors can be solutions like justice when independent variables intervene)
        - relatedly, 'error comparison structures (like error level vs. error count)' are useful as a different graph to 'connect problems/solutions' than the abstract-specific (problem type to specific solution structures for each problem type) which applies specific structures of problems as the core layer, where an interim graph of 'specific problem/solution structures and their abstractions or connections' is more generally useful, which is generally useful for generating relevant graphs, similar to how 'integrating graphs' like the interface variable spectrum graph (with abstract/specific at opposite ends of a spectrum which intersects with other interface variable spectrums, which is a useful graph for 'connecting problems/solutions (oppose)' like how an 'excess' error of 'abstraction' can be resolved with its opposite) and the 'core function/similarity graph of interface variables' (like how 'abstract requirements' can be connected with core functions like 'find/generate' by 'similar' interface structures like 'abstract intents', which 'connects problems/solutions (find/generate)' by similarity) so one graph applies differences and one applies similarities, which can be integrated bc similar interface structures occur across these graphs like 'abstract intents' so an 'abstract/specific spectrum connection' can be integrated with an 'abstract requirement/intent connection' by a common node but different connection types (similarity connections like 'find/generate' vs. difference connections like 'oppose an error like excess')
        - relatedly, identifying how 'a/symmetries can create a/symmetries in functions' is useful for connecting interface structures like 'averages/limits' of similarities/differences with '2-d interface comparison/correlation functions' as a way to connect '2-d interface comparison graphs' with 'connection 2-d graphs having components/interim variables', weighted by 'context structures like cross-context averages' to represent '2-d comparison graphs' in contexts like 'specific systems/graphs' (weighted by probability/average/other relevant variable across contexts), where these contexts determine the connecting variables of these 2-d graphs

    - identifying useful structures like 'conceptual bases/reasons that can be applied as "filters of specific useful changes to apply" (like direction changes)'
        - for example, 'identifying reasons (like freedom) for a structure (like iteration)' can identify a 'conceptual basis for applying changes in a specific direction', given the 'missing freedom/variation in the identified system variables', which identifies a different direction to apply iterations in as a 'possible source of the missing variation'
        - relatedly, identifying 'patterns/similarities' in what 'errors occur in a system based on patterns/similarities in a graph' (like the 'uncertainty space in the interface spectrum graph') is possible by identifying 'graphs of common system structures and common variation structures associated with these systems and common interactions of these variables leading to interface structures like patterns' (as in 'connecting systems/variables/their interactions with interface structures like "specifications of interface variables" in the same graph'), so that patterns like 'more over-prioritization errors across more interfaces occur in systems with higher complexity' can be identified
        - relatedly, identifying specific structures of inter-graph relevance is useful, like how graphs with 'relevant similarities/differences (like cross-interface relevance)' can be identified like how graphs can be 'similar in structure and different in intents fulfilled by those structures', which will identify 'multi-interface similarity indexes of graphs' where the 'highest similarity ratios' can be connected to 'problem types or other useful initial filters to start solving problems from'
        - relatedly, identifying different useful bases for graphs like 'specific errors/solutions to avoid/prioritize' is useful, such as how the 'uncertainty graph' applies a similarity in structure of an error type (over-prioritizations/extremes) which identifies a 'possible area of higher relevance graphs', so 'applying other error types as similar structures' can identify other areas of higher relevance graphs and identifying 'similarities/connections between these areas' is possible once those areas are identified

    - identifying useful structures like 'specific functions/intents to apply to optimize usage of an interface graph to fulfill interface intents (solve problems with abstract structures on a set of abstract graphs)'
        - for example, 'identifying abstract similarities (out of a list of prioritized useful abstract similarities or similarity structures to identify)' and then 'identifying a general maximally different problem-solving intent that the abstract similarity might be useful for' and 'identifying indirect/distant indicators of relevance to a problem-solving intent or other useful filter of which graphs or graph structures to use (like identifying which area of a problem type/intent-based graph to use by identifying indicators of relevance like irrelevant problem types/intents)' is a useful intent set to apply to a 'graph of abstract/interface graphs' to solve problems using abstract structures on a set of abstract-relevant graphs
        - relatedly, identifying 'emergent questions adjacently generated by a graph' (like 'given this similarity and this emergent pattern based on that similarity, is there a more optimal similarity to apply that would likely optimize the emergent pattern') is useful to identify relevant problems to the problems solved by a graph
        - relatedly, identifying 'structural intents related to useful graphs' like 'where relevance is a point (or set/area of points) or a line (like a limit) on a graph' are useful to identify and identify optimizations/usages of these intents like 'what intents a relevance graph of a specific structure would be useful for' as a way to 'identify abstract descriptions of graphs that are specific enough to be useful to identify which graphs should be specified further'

    - identifying useful structures like 'new graph structures like "interface network structures" like "average similarities to represent abstractions in a network format" to apply to identified graph structures'
        - for example, given a set of graphs like 'a set of graphs of abstract interface structures (like "count of iteration" of abstract interface structures like abstract requirements and abstract pattern optimizations and the "count of specification" and so on for other structural interface metrics to generate other relevant graphs of abstract structures)' for the 'abstract' interface (and 'connections between those graphs and interface structures of those connections/graphs'), applying the 'structure of an abstraction' (like an average or other approximation structure) in this set of graphs as a way to structure the identification of ways to use abstractions to solve problems
            - this means identifying the 'averages/approximates/other general similarity structures' that can connect all structures in these graphs and these graphs as a way to solve all problems using this set of graphs to represent the abstract interface, which will identify workflows like '"abstract" to identify type similarities between problem/solution, then "specify" to identify specific connections of those types representing a solution-finding method' using these 'average/approximate similarity structures' to 'connect all differences/problems' on this set of graphs, such as how identifying how the 'abstract similarity of abstract-specific graphs or spectrums for problem-solving processes' (of first 'moving away from the problem and then moving toward a solution' is similar to how 'identifying problem causes to identify causes of solutions' first 'moves away from a solution and then toward a solution') is possible with graphs generated by relevance structures like 'interface variable spectrums' and abstract similarities like 'different, then similar (in position)' of 'queries on those graphs like queries on the abstract-specific spectrum', which is useful to identify abstract similarities in workflows like 'change an interface variable like "abstraction" to more trivially identify its opposite solution structure like "specification"', an 'abstract similarity in workflows' which can be trivially generated by 'abstract similarities in and across these graphs'
        - the point of this is to apply a problem-solving structure (an abstract similarity structure like an 'average or approximate similarity') to a graph that is already in a format relevant to that structure (a network of graphs related to abstractions and their connections/similarities)
        - relatedly, identifying 'abstract similarities on a spectrum' is another example of applying a problem-solving structure to a graph in a new way
        - relatedly, identifying 'cross-interface (like concept-structure) optimizations of graphs' such as 'applying structures like "momentum" of concepts like "incentives" to increase the probability of moving toward optimal structures on a solution/error graph' is a useful graph optimization intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between problem-solving intents and optimization opportunities (based on some similarity/difference of an identified graph)' is useful to identify 'useful graph optimization structures like metrics/connections/sequences'
        - for example, identifying a 'similarity/difference (like a similar node position, and different/new/optimized connection function) that can be optimized in an existing graph' is useful as a way to identify 'graph optimization metrics' to identify when 'potential to optimize' exists which implements a workflow like 'change a base solution' in a new way, and identifying how these similarities/differences between graphs can be connected to problem-solving intents like how a 'optimized connection function of the same nodes' can improve metrics like 'query time/accuracy' by identifying a 'more accurate similarity to base a connection function on' (as well as identifying 'reasons for the optimization opportunity' like 'there is a high ratio of repetitions in the connections of the graph' or 'some nodes arent adjacently connectible' or 'patterns havent emerged in the graph indicating the connection function didnt apply/enable enough variation' or the 'graph has an overprioritization error like over-simplicity and is too homogeneous to be useful in reflecting variation')
        - relatedly, identifying 'graph optimization rules/patterns/similarities/dynamics' like 'usually simple structural optimizations like time optimizations regularly intersperse other optimization types' and 'reasons for the rules' like 'once a new variable is identified, it can be used to improve every simple structural variable, so there will regularly be vacillations between new variables and the improvements to other variables like simple structural variables (like time/performance) they enable'

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph intent optimizations like graph structure/intent sequence alignment optimizations and graph intent sequence optimizations' that can be identified from 'variables of a new graph' to enable intents like 'identifying requirements for new graphs'
        - for example, intents like 'identify differences in a variable allowed to vary in the graph' is an intent that is possible 'once a new graph is identified' bc the identification of a new graph allows a 'sequence of intents' to be applied/implemented, and the 'last intents of an identified graph' are intents like 'identify its position in a graph of graphs' and 'identify the limits of its usefulness', alignments of 'new identified graph structures' and 'intents possible with those graph structures' that are useful to identify so that 'queries about requirements for new graphs and new graph metrics can be run' and 'intent optimizations' (like 'intents that can be skipped' and 'intents that can be identified first' like the 'compression of a graph' and 'emergent useful queries/similarities on that graph, given its independent or irrelevant interface variables' and 'identifying the graph structure state/sequence position required to solve a problem') can be identified for that and similar graphs
            - relatedly, different graph compressions identify different positions of a graph in a graph of graphs, which is useful for intents related to 'identifying missing graphs (like differently relevant graphs)' (with queries like 'if a graph matching this description is probably missing as in "probably not an already identified graph area/position" across multiple relevance graph compressions, its a useful graph to identify/apply in queries', as in 'differently relevant in multiple relevance graphs' or 'if a graph has similar position to a related graph in multiple graph compressions, its a useful similarity to identify and apply in a new graph')
        - relatedly, a 'abstract-specific relevance graph hierarchy' is useful as a way to 'identify useful graph layers and useful queries across graph layers' like 'abstract descriptions of relevance (like increasing relevance)' which can be specified as 'multi-definition relevance' in the next layer and 'interface-related relevance for those definitions of relevance' and so on, until a useful degree of specification is identified in this hierarchy
        - relatedly, 'graph-based similarities/differences (intra/inter/cross graph similarities)' like 'in a similar sequence/position/structure on different graphs' and 'in a similar sequence/position/structure related to a similar base (like an average/limit) on different graphs' and other graph-based similarities/differences are useful for 'identifying new connections' to use when fulfilling intents like 'connect problem/solution'
        - relatedly, a 'highly volatile area/structure' like a 'position on a border of a different type/phase that will trigger a high ratio of changes' is useful to identify as a way of identifying a 'high ratio of info' from a trivial change (identifying substances that cause organ damage is trivial if organ damage is already adjacent, so that any substance with negative impact will cause a 'high ratio of info' in the form of obvious immediate symptoms), which enables intents like 'check for highly volatile change borders/areas/structures first, since theyre so useful to identify'

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs like interface spectrums to connect different types of similarities in graphs' to identify 'useful graph sequences to use in workflows' like 'identify maximally different graphs based on structural similarities in intent-relevance graphs to identify different useful similarities to apply (like to "specify" intent similarities with relevant structures)'
        - for example, graphs of interface spectrums (like 'structure/intent/logic similarities') connecting 'different types of similarities' (which cant be graphed in the same graph) in a relevance graph (of intent-specific relevance, cross-intent relevance, and other interface structures like types of relevance)
        - relatedly, identifying interface intents of problem/solution structures (like whether the problem is a component of a solution, a required abstraction of a solution, etc) is useful to 'identify interface connections' between the problem/solution
        - relatedly, identifying similarities like 'similar sequences/implementations/irrelevant structures' between variants like 'identify/filter' of an intent like 'find' is useful to identify useful graphs to implement the 'find' function like how 'simple reversals' are 'irrelevant for most intents including find intents' so these can be applied as 'error structures to avoid or apply as limits'
        - relatedly, identifying interface structures (like 'limits/opposites/contradictions') of 'comparisons' is useful, to generate networks of useful 'comparisons' (like the 'ratio that can contradict another ratio' or 'comparisons of comparisons' as in 'useful bases to compare comparisons to' like 'limits/opposites/contradictions')
            - similarly, 'comparisons which identify interface variables' (like how 'average/range limits' identify info about interface variables like 'position' of 'all data points') are useful to identify, and other 'high info comparisons like "similarity-comparison comparisons"' are useful, like a 'ratio of similarities (like "most" cross-interface similarities) that can be contradicted by a comparison (like whether the one difference is related to specific/definition/certainty structures which may be able to contradict a set of similarities (even if its similar in most ways, one difference in a specific/definition/certainty structure could contradict that similarity)'

    - identifying useful structures like "interface metric structures like 'change ratios' of similarity/difference structures" that are useful in 'generating problem-solving intents/workflows'
        - identifying 'similarities across workflows/intents/interface structures' is useful, like how problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation', problem-solving formats like 'identify missing variants', and workflows like 'change a base solution' all involve applying slight differences (which apply similarity/difference structures like a 'similarity to identified solutions' or a 'similarity in a difference on a graph of other variants' to identify missing variants or a 'similarity to existing variation' with a sufficient difference to create new variation is applied), which identifies a 'direction of variation' or a 'spectrum crossing various interfaces' which can generate these differences and connect these intents/workflows, where applying differences in different interface structures like a 'different ratio of change' is a useful spectrum to start from when generating workflows/intents by varying interface metric structures like 'change ratios'
            - relatedly, identifying the most similar/average/general intent of these similar intents is a useful starting intent to specify to adapt it to a specific problem (with a related intent like 'identify the most general intents and specify these intents for specific problems')
        - relatedly, identifying the 'emergent meaning of a graph set', like emergent 'workflows/problem-solving intents/other interface structures that can be fulfilled' when a set of graphs are adjacent, is a useful intent to identify useful 'graph organization/generation functions'
        - relatedly, interface structures of relevance like 'rare relevance' like 'relevance to all graphs' is useful/possible to identify and organize in a graph of graphs (with graph spectrums/structures like 'rare to common graphs of relevance structures', 'abstractions/specifications of relevance structures', etc), which enable intents like 'identify solutions using combinations of common (and therefore trivial to identify) relevance structures'
        - relatedly, identifying 'multi-variable spectrums (multi-variable correlations/alignments/similarities)' is useful for generating 'graphs with these spectrums as nodes' which is a graph that would 'describe a high ratio of variation'

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph organization functions/sequences/structures' that are useful for intents like 'prioritizing identified problem types first'
        - for example, identifying useful graphs like 'useful structures with graphs for problem-solving intents relevant to that structure' is useful as a way to organize relevant graphs, such as how a useful structures like a 'type set' can be organized with useful graphs like 'spectrum/circle/layer graphs for identifying different variants of items in a set' for problem-solving intents like 'identify missing info (like missing types)'
        - this is useful to organize problem-solving intents with structures like 'type sets' that can have errors like 'missing info' as a default set of graphs to apply to solve 'probable problems relevant to a structure first (as the first layer of graphs around a structure first)
        - relatedly, any 'missing items in the set of problem-solving intents' can be identified in a similar way, given the layers of problem-solving intents around each useful structure
        - similarly, each 'useful structure' node can be optimized to be a 'set of useful structures to connect' where problem-solving intents are relevant to solving the problems related to 'identifying that connection and its variants'
        - relatedly, graphs like 'spectrum/circle graphs to identify missing items in a set' apply a 'similarity in variation' where the 'amount of variation in a particular distance on some variable' is applied as 'sufficient to identify a new item in the set', where 'identifying this variation/distance match' is a useful intent related to identifying these graphs, and where 'independent (maximally different) variables' can be applied as the 'variation required to identify different items'
            - identifying missing graphs like 'graphs that resolve some set of differences that isnt resolved by identified graphs' is an example of applying 'identifying missing items in a set' to the set of useful graphs
        - relatedly, rules like 'identify maximally different items in the set first' are useful for 'identifying which items are missing' since this is useful for pre-filtering the set of other items ('identifying alternating items also identifies the interim items', etc), where this rule makes this graph more useful to apply as a general problem-solving format ('connect problem/solution' implemented as 'identify missing connections between general problems/solutions or this problem/solution type or this specific problem/solution, once maximally different connections are identified'), where different layers of this graph can map to 'different abstraction/complexity/iteration/other interface spectrum variable values', which is a useful graph to identify connection-filtering rules like 'there is always a way to apply randomness to connect structures, but its often more useful as a way to identify the correct variant, rather than as the actual solution'
        - relatedly, graphing 'interface queries by similarity of intent/input/other interface structures', 'specifications (like "volatile abstract connection similarities") required for iterated interface structures to be useful to connect', 'sets of equivalent alternates (like requirements/intents) that are similar enough to create similar queries (similar in some interface variable)', 'graphs of alternate connection types that can connect similarly different structures like "similarly aligned/sorted sequences/stacks of differences in sets" which can create similar variation on the same layer/distance', 'volatile sequences/stacks of interface structures to optimize interactivity or connectivity of independent variables', 'similarities (like inputs) in intents (like find/build) to base networks for queries on', 'differences that are connectible in related sets like "abstract requirements/similarities/types/connections" which are different enough to support most queries (enough differences in abstractions)' and other structures that identify/enable different graphs are useful to identify

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph inputs like "certainty structures"' such as how 'general simple connections' are useful as a 'starting point for a graph' to apply a '2-d uncertainty graph' in a grid format (to allow all the possible uncertainties between abstract structures to be resolved)
        - for example, identifying 'abstract ratios/thresholds/structures' is useful to identify 'simple general/conceptual connections', which can be a base for a graph as a 'grid' (a 'grid' of simple abstract connections/structures like 'abstract ratios/thresholds' where more complex/specific/otherwise relevant connections are between the general simple connections), which I identified by thinking about how generally reducing 'inputs to functions' (reducing 'work') to increase variables like 'free parameters/resources (freedom)' is a way to identify default problem-solving structures, like a 'general threshold of freedom' at which point default solutions are activated (applying general principles like 'when some functions stop being used, other functions can be used' bc of 'resource limits' like 'energy limits'), as opposed to 'reducing specific variables/inputs' which can be more complicated than 'generally reducing all inputs the same degree' and doesnt reveal a 'general threshold'
            - relatedly, 'simple/general' structures are connected bc general/abstract structures tend to reduce variables required so they have a simplifying effect in some cases, as an example of a 'simple abstract connection'
        - relatedly, identifying 'graph extremes' like 'one-error vs. all-error variables (like generators) of a graph' (as opposed to a graph with errors or a graph that is capable of errors, a graph created by generative variables that are errors like 'incorrect assumptions') are useful to 'identify graph structures to apply changes to' ('graph extremes' being a 'certainty' structure as in a 'limit' of a graph to base changes on), as a way to apply problem/solution structures as 'inputs to a graph' and therefore identify connections between errors in 'causal graphs of graphs'
        - relatedly, identifying useful interface intents for a graph (like 'iterate/align/specify') is useful where a graph has an optimization opportunity (like how the 'uncertainty spectrum graph' likely could be improved by repeating spectrums to have more intersections, aligning them to have different intersections, or otherwise changing the graph to have more than one intersection, since thats too simple to model the interactions of interfaces)
            - similarly, the 'area of uncertainty' in the 'uncertainty graph' is unlikely to be absolute as there are likely errors of irrelevance in this uncertainty space and extremes of the spectrums are similarly likely to be relevant in some cases so this is a suboptimal graph in those variables as well
            - the 'ratio of relevance' that creates the 'area of uncertainty' in this graph is still useful to identify, as there is likely a 'similarity in this ratio' across interface variable spectrums which is useful for identifying an 'area of higher relevance' of the intersections of this ratios across interacting spectrums (by applying that similarity), which identifies 'identifying what useful structures (like areas of relevance) in a graph can be identified by identifying/requiring/applying a similarity (like a similar ratio of relevance)' as a useful intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'intents that are likely to be useful to specify/extend/connect (to create useful variants or other useful intents to connect in a sequence to solve problems)' like 'identifying relevant variation to solve a problem' which is useful to extend/specify now that 'graphs of relevant variation' like 'abstract-specific graphs' are specified/structured (which creates an opportunity to integrate these relevant structures and optimize for interface intents like 'integrate graphs of relevant variation with intents related to identifying relevant variation (like identifying the structure of relevant variation)')
        - for example, 'identifying "relevant variation" to solve a problem' (like 'identify the opposite of this problematic variable value') is a default problem-solving intent which can be extended/connected to be relevant to other intents like 'identify a graph with the required "relevant variation" to solve a problem' (like 'identify a graph with the problem variable value on the extreme of a spectrum (which includes its opposite)') and 'identify a graph structure representing this type of "relevant variation" (identify the structure/other interface value of the "relevant variation" required to solve a problem)' (like how 'rings around a center' are a graph structure to represent "relevant variation" types like 'specification of an abstraction' or 'variants of a type') and 'identify interactions of "relevant variation" types' (like identify useful graphs of "relevant variation" types like 'abstract-specific graph spectrums' and 'interface variable spectrum intersections' which can be usefully integrated in the same graph like as grids or bases or connecting graphs)
            - relatedly, identifying 'graphs that can be changed into a graph with a complete volatility spectrum' where there isnt a graph with a 'complete spectrum of opposites' can be done by for example identifying 'graphs where volatility changes at all, at different positions' which can be changed into a 'graph with a complete spectrum of volatility' that can solve the original problem of 'decreasing/increasing problematic volatility', where the problem of 'identifying a graph with a relevant complete volatility spectrum' isnt already solved
        - relatedly, 'identifying gaps/errors in structures like "spectrums" of volatility graphs' is a related intent to 'identifying spectrums of volatility (enabling/implementing/using) graphs' (once a structure like a spectrum is identified, 'identifying errors like gaps in that structure' is useful to identify and resolve, for problem-solving intents that involve 'changes on that spectrum')

    - identifying useful structures like new integrations of related graphs like 'abstract-specific graph' and the 'solution metric network' and workflows like 'change a base solution' which are useful for intents like 'connecting error structures of solutions' where these connections are useful for problem-solving intents like 'identify common causal points to apply as intents to solve a problem'
        - for example, identifying graphs like a way to apply an abstract-specific spectrum in a useful way, like abstract solution structures like 'solution metrics' connected to specific/relevant combinations of solution metrics and specific/relevant implementations of combinations of solution metrics and specific/relevant usages of those implementations and specific/relevant systems/contexts in which those usages are applied, which can be extended until 'abstract combinations/implementations/usages/contexts' are also connected so there are multiple centers of abstraction, and identifying 'where errors begin to occur when starting from abstract solution metrics' on this graph is useful to identify 'common points to revert to when errors begin to occur (like implementation errors like "differences from requirements from abstract requirements")', which is a useful variant of the 'change a base solution' workflow (where abstract solution structures are the base and where other bases like contexts/usages/implementations are also relevant)
            - other variants of this graph involve identifying abstract errors like 'over-simplifications' with abstract solution metrics and connecting those directly so that the causal error structures are identified for all sequences and the implementations errors that abstract solution metric errors can cause are clearly connected, and similarly identifying 'specific errors of abstract solution metric combinations' is another useful intent/graph variant
            - relatedly, a more evenly distributed graph is also relevant, such as where 'contexts/usages/implementations/metrics' are evenly distributed to require fewer steps to identify relevant interface structures and allow replication of structures which the 'base graph' above doesnt allow
        - relatedly, a graph of similarities in similarities like a similarity index network (like a network of error types where 'similar error structures across error types') are identifiable and connectible, so that for example where an 'incentivized error' is also a 'relevant error' can be identified by some similarity like a structural similarity

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections with unidentified variation/similarities within/on a core/base similarity' are useful to identify 'optimization structures (like optimizations points) like alternate optimal networks/starting points'
        - 'connection network sequences' across similarities like 'data set/summary/loss functions' have alternate optimal networks like 'set of changes to convert common data sets into functions, organized by commonness'
        - identifying the 'interface network of a structure (like the "interface network of change types" or the "interface network of a network" or the "interface network of a function")' to identify all possible interface changes that are relevant to a function or identify all possible relevant changes for a 'connection network' to be capable of or to identify all relevant changes to apply to inputs to generate 'relevant differences in inputs' (relevant differences in inputs are useful for identifying relevant differences in 'summary and error functions', such as how 'maximally different inputs applied to a neural network' like 'relevant input ranges/reference points' are useful to identify 'relevant solution/error function structures')
        - identifying 'what networks are capable of which changes, given some input types/variables/interface structures' is useful
            - relatedly, identifying what 'change sets/networks' are capable of creating 'linear/non-linear/otherwise useful loss functions' is useful for 'predicting loss function metrics' like general volatility/shape and therefore pre-filtering/optimizing 'possible loss functions of a network'
        - relatedly, given that 'high/low areas of loss functions' mean 'higher/lower errors (an aggregated set of differences from the actual/optimal solution function', identifying how 'aggregated differences map to similar/different functions and map to a relative position on a loss function (aggregation above some threshold value being unnecessary, where the threshold of relevance in the loss function value can be predetermined to some degree)' and how 'aggregated differences can be locally/globally minimized with functions like distribution/standardization in the network' are useful for identifying how to 'increase/decrease errors/loss' and how to 'create optimally mixed-solution/error functions' and how to connect 'solution/error structures' to 'data set/network/algorithm meaning', which are useful intents for pre-filtering loss functions
        - relatedly, identifying 'interface structures of connections like subset connections' like 'this subnetwork (subset of nodes/connections) is useful for creating this change type' is similarly useful for identifying useful similarities across similarity sequences (like 'data set/summary function/loss function')
        - relatedly, the 'changes possible with different inputs (different network weights/activated nodes)' are related to the 'loss function for a given data set (difference function between predicted/actual solution functions)', where 'interface variables like "change variables" like "potential/probable/required volatility" of a set of network algorithms/structures/weight starting points/node activations' can be generally identified and therefore optimized
        - relatedly, identifying the 'most relevant changes that can be applied' like a 'variable that changes all interface structures of a function' are similarly possible to identify, with rules involving structures like 'required variation for a network to be useful' being useful to identify

    - identifying useful structures like 'useful problem/solution variables' like 'positions of problem/solution structures to identify new useful graphs to solve problems' or 'spectrums of graphs of prioritized interactions'
        - for example, different graphs from the 'uncertainty graph of graphs applying interface spectrums' (solves problems of 'connecting different reference values like extremes on the same interface spectrums and connecting averages of different interface spectrums') include the 'abstract-specific graph of interfaces (with core interfaces in the inner layer and iterated/embedded/appplied interface structures (like required functions) on outer layers' (solves problems of 'connecting iterated/embedded interface structures with different areas indicating different interfaces'), and a 'graph of interface spectrums positioned vertically in an outer layer' to avoid the problem of "forcing interactions on one area of the spectrums like 'averages'" (solves problems of 'connecting all areas of interface spectrums' by increasing the dimension), and a 'graph of interface bases on an outer layer with embedded specific interface structures in an inner layer to identify interactions of embedded interface structures' (solves problems of 'connecting embedded interface structures by similarities like layer of specificity'), and a 'graph of different similarity/difference variants and their connections' (solves problems of 'connecting connection/similarity structures like iterated symmetries')
            - these graphs and the associated connections they allow can be connected to problems solved by that graph as well as connecting the problems solved by a graph to 'interface queries/workflows relevant to that problem', to organize these graphs by problem type (problem types/problem-solving intents in the inner layer with outer layers indicating these useful graphs for that problem type), and to identify which graphs implement the most useful interface queries by default
            - this identifies rules like 'apply interim/unbiased graphs (vertical abstract spectrum graph) as base graphs except where biases/priorities are identified as useful (identifying interactions of averages on interface spectrums also identifies more complex/useful interactions, if extreme interactions like limits are already identified)', where a 'graph of these interim graphs on inner layers' is another useful 'graph of graphs'
            - all graphs can be generated by rules like 'applying differences/similarities in every possible position/structure (apply differences adjacently (like problem types) or distantly (like unsolved problems to solve with interim connecting structures) and connect graphs by increasing differences on these graph variables like "difference position"' as an alternative useful graph network to 'connect problems/graphs'
            - relatedly, some graphs like '2-d correlation graphs' can be formatted as vectors where standardizable to the same axes sets which removes unnecessary info from a graph of graphs to clarify diffferences
            - relatedly, identifying variables like 'positions in between required/impossible' to identify optimal graphs to identify specific structures like 'applying a structure as prioritized but not required is useful to identify other variants of that structure' or 'applying a structure as required is useful to identify the limits of its requirements (meaning its other requirements and where its impossible/prioritized)'
        - relatedly, the 'most relevant graphs to include in a graph of graphs' can be identified, such as how the 'most relevant requirements are useful to graph abstractions of to identify probable variants of requirements (which can be implementations)'
        - relatedly, graphs that 'connect variables that are connectible with interface variables' ('structure/type' can be connected with 'abstract') is another graph that is useful for 'identifying complex connections by which connections are connectible with interface variables (simple interface connections)'
        - relatedly, a graph of problem systems and their interactions like their 'connections and embeddings/applications/iterations' (embedding/applying/iterating a problem system in another problem system) is a useful graph to identify similarities between problem systems which represent 'opportunities for general problem-solving across problems' and other useful 'similarities across problems'

    - identifying useful structures like 'useful optimizations to apply to a graph' to fulfill intents like 'identifying a graph to solve all problems' and related intents like 'identifying a graph to integrate all useful structures'
        - for example, identifying 'optimizations to usefully similar graphs like similarly complex graphs (like the uncertainty graph of graphs on interface variable spectrums)' like 'integrations of other graphs (like implementations of the abstract-specific graph or the abstract/workflow graph or overlaps with the similarity index network or the workflow network or the problem-solving intent network with the uncertainty graph)' is useful for intents like 'identifying similarities in optimal graph queries that align with the graphs'
            - similarly, identifying other optimizations like 'aligning useful queries and differentiating useful variation' and 'applying structures (like abstract structure networks) regularly to provide intents fulfillable on the graph of graphs (the graphs fulfill problem-solving intents to connect the structures)' are similarly useful to apply to this graph to make it more useful for intents like 'identify a graph to solve all problems (integrating all useful structures like interface variables and useful graphs)'
            - this relates to identifying 'relevant similarities' between useful structures in this graph, like 'graph similarity sequences' that have a similarity like an 'alignment' with some problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying useful 'starting points for workflows/problem-solving intents' like 'identify interface structures (like opposites) of an interface structure (like required differences) to identify useful graphs connecting these structures (connecting unnecessary similarities with required differences, for example)' is possible, and once these networks (a network of the 'relevant differences' as in 'interface structures' of each interface structure) are identified, graphs that connect the emerging patterns/similarities across these 'interface structures of interface structure networks' will be identifiable, to connect all relevant differences
            - 'identifying a graph to solve all problems' can be done by identifying networks for each interface structure, like a 'network of graphs that solve problems to connect relevant differences for a specific interface structure, like graphs connecting the structure with its interface structures like its useful optimization limits, similar to how a graph sequence like a 2-d requirements/intent graph and a 2-d intent/problem type graph can be used to connect requirements and problem types' and then connecting those networks for each interface structure by some similarity like 'overlaps/alignments across these networks', where some specification like an iteration of interface structures is useful as the core structure of these graphs as opposed to just applying the core interface variables as the core structure of these graphs
            - this can be generalized to a workflow that involves identifying 'causal/generative/descriptive/interface similarity graphs (of a useful graph to identify)' like 'identify a useful graph type (networks of interface structures of interface structures) that once identified, will identify another useful graph type (a general problem-solving graph of graphs)'
            - this is useful bc these networks are likely to be more definable/adjacent than the target graph and are also likely to be more filtering of the target graph than structures from other methods (each additional graph identified will make completing the target graph with inference more trivial)
        - relatedly, identifying useful structures like 'reasons to use similarities like "only 2-d graph types" on the uncertainty graph of graphs as a base for queries' (like '2-d graphs are likely to be already computed and are likely to have clear un/correlations') is a useful intent to identify reasons that these similarities are useful to problem-solving intents
        - relatedly, identifying optimizations like 'identify variation that can optimize less optimal/useful areas/structures of a graph' like how 'applying interface networks (error networks, interface connection networks) of an extreme on an interface variable spectrum' can 'increase the relevance of the extreme position'

    - identifying useful structures like 'alternate ways to connect different graph types (like correlation graphs of interface variables) and alternate ways to apply these graph types to fulfill interface queries (like similarity queries)'
        - for example, the 'graph of graphs in the uncertainty space between interface spectrum extremes' is useful when 'connecting problem/solution structures' (like 'descriptive metrics' like 'problem complexity/solution simplicity'), by connecting the graphs at those extremes on this 'graph of graphs'
            - another way to use graphs to 'connect problem/solution structures' is to identify 'correlation graphs between interface variables' to apply as 'starting graph sets to apply changes to' in order to identify optimal graphs (with optimal/solution correlations/differences), to fulfill graph intents like 'identify interface variable connections with increasing correlations' which would identify 'randomized simplicity' and 'sorted/organized complexity' as useful 'connecting graphs' between simplicity/complexity, given that these interface variable connections are in between extremes on that spectrum (similarly identifying 'graphs on an interface variable spectrum to connect reference values on that spectrum' is a related intent to fulfill this intent)
            - I thought about this when identifying possible structures of graphs in this uncertainty space, at which point I thought about how the most common problem-solving intents would likely identify the most useful graphs in this space (other than applying definitions of usefulness like 'multi-functional graphs' across high variation metrics like 'multi-functionality across different embeddings/iterations/formats of interface structures'), at which point I thought about how to connect problem/solution structures in that space using a basic graph like a 'correlation graph between two variables' (which describes the outer layer of graphs in this space) where problem/solution variables (like the core concept driving a problem like 'complexity' and the core concept driving a solution like 'simplicity') were on different axes of the 2-d correlation graph, at which point it became clear that this overlaps with a problem-solving intent to 'identify a useful graph format (like "already identified two-variable correlation graphs on this graph of graphs") to identify similarities (like "correlations") which can fulfill "similarity-based interface queries" to connect problems/solutions', and 'identifying the core similarities like concepts/types of a problem/solution to check for various possible correlations/similarities' was a useful basic workflow to 'apply these graphs of interface variable correlations'
            - similarly, other intents like 'identify an "iteration level" of interface structures at which point additional useful similarities are likely to be identifiable' can be fulfilled using this 'graph of graphs' with varying connection functions like 'iteration'

    - identifying useful structures like 'queries that identify useful intents that can be used as problem-solving structures like workflows'
        - for example, queries like 'is there always a graph where a relevant ratio (most/all) of solutions are adjacent' is useful for identifying intents that can be used as workflows like 'identify a graph where a subset of solutions are non-adjacent and identify changes to the graph (like zoom/angle changes or distance definition changes) to make solutions adjacent (or otherwise usefully connectible)' or 'identify a graph where a subset of solutions are adjacent and check if other solutions are similarly adjacent' or 'predict a similarity between solutions on some graph based on which similarities are identified as either ir/relevant to that graph or set of solutions', where these intents are general enough to be used as problem-solving intents or workflows, which is possible bc the query is general, involves problem/solution structures and identifies adjacent intents which are useful by their possible variants (non-adjacent/adjacent solution variants are similarly connectible to other useful structures like graphs and graph similarities)

    - identifying useful structures like 'assumption/workflow networks' which are useful for intents like 'filtering workflows' and 'optimizing network interactions'
        - for example, a workflow like 'change a base solution' assumes a solution/error configuration involving a 'solution area around the base solution', so 'identifying workflows to connect solution/error configurations' is a useful alternate problem-solving intent to apply a different workflow if the assumption for a workflow is false, where 'assumptions to prioritize, which are applicable to the most/most common workflows' is another related network to identify, where these two networks of 'connections between workflow and solution/error configurations' and 'connections between assumptions/workflows' are useful to 'integrate given their overlaps' or 'apply in a sequence or a cyclical feedback loop given their mutual impact' or 'apply as limiting networks to create a range', which are useful example 'network interactions' to apply in workflows
            - relatedly, similar to how there are multiple different types of connections (true/false or abstract/specific variants of a connection), there are also often 'multiple true (correct/optimal/possible/valid/required/direct) ways to connect a set of variables', and similar to how there are known false connections ('all simple rules are true' is false), there are likely true variants involving interface structures that are 'mostly/always true or never/rarely true' which are possible to identify and apply as 'different limiting bases (a range) to apply connections between to identify useful optimizations in between'
            - relatedly, other relevance structures like 'continuous/cumulative relevance' which reflect 'similarities/connections in relevance' are useful to identify
        - relatedly, in the graph of graphs in the uncertainty space of interface variable spectrums, identifying 'which n-dimensional graphs' are useful to identify/filter (like how a 3-d graph can involve/implement/apply/create iterated interface structures or embedded interface structures or cross interface structures, etc and only some of these graphs will be useful to connect to 2/4-d variants/alternatives of the graph like the 'similarities that create sequences (of useful structures like solutions/optimals/averages) in graphs on some variable like dimension count', or some of these graphs will be more useful to connect than other graphs since some graphs will implement 'interface structures (like limits/averages/similarities) of the graph of graphs')
            - relatedly, this 'graph of graphs in the uncertainty space of interface variable spectrums' has relevant specifications like that there are identified graphs on the outer layer that are relevant to that interface variable spectrum value as an over-prioritization error that generated those graphs (error graphs are identifiable in the error positions like over-prioritization errors on these spectrums), and these error graphs may have useful patterns so are useful to synchronize/standardize/similarize with other error graphs for other extremes 
        - relatedly, 'relative comparisons/similarities/connections' are solved on structures like 'spectrums' (as in 'once an item is identified as on a spectrum, the other structures its similar to on that spectrum are also identified'), which are useful to connect to solve other 'comparison types' (connect all spectrums/rings like 'similar abstraction definitions/limits' or 'interface variable spectrums') so that the intent of 'identifying which spectrum/set/structure a problem/solution structure is an item of' is the relevant intent to solve instead

    - identifying useful structures like 'filters of useful graphs' like the 'limits of interactions of similarities' as alternatives to 'indexes of relevant graph variants/variables/types'
        - for example, its useful to identify the 'limits of similarities and the limits of interactions of similarities' when 'identifying whether the current graph is likely to be useful (at connecting the relevant info for a problem)', as a way of identifying that info quickly and as an alternative to identifying an index of 'known useful graph variants/variables/types' in the 'relevant uncertainty space in between extremes of interface variables like simplicity/complexity', bc knowing the limit of a similarity or its interactions with other similarities like 'when a similarity occurs with or creates another similarity' can identify the limits on info that the similarity can reflect and this is relevant to intents like 'identifying whether a similarity will ever interact with some variable like the problem/solution variables' by whether that similarity is defined/required/capable of that interaction, and the graph's similarities are often trivial to identify or already defined
        - relatedly, 'intent similarity networks' and other 'similarity network types' are useful to connect in a 'graph of graphs' to identify possible similarities other than known similarities in interface definitions
        - relatedly, the 'similarities like patterns' that emerge from 'abstract-specific/definition/interface graphs' should be maximally different to match the maximally different concepts, which is another way to filter/complete/derive the graph (where the abstract structures like 'blurs/ranges/averages' that can be used to represent 'abstractions' should emerge from an abstract-structure graph, where there should be at least one of these structures that emerge from each concept)
        - relatedly, a useful 'graph of graphs' can be identified by aligning the 'sequence of bases' with identified useful variable base sequences like how 'different types of relevance can be based on each other' so a graph of 'different types of relevance' can be the most useful 'graph of graphs', where other graph metrics like 'almost or completely continuous' and non-metrics that identify metrics like how "volatility between graphs on the graph can vary without negating usefulness, but structures like low/high volatility areas/thresholds/positions might exist on the graph in a useful pattern, so 'nonzero volatility' is a useful graph metric since volatility is expected in cases like when an interface intervenes with another, but a specific volatility value like 'low volatility' isnt required for usefulness since there are both non-volatile and volatile useful graphs since 'volatility' isnt an exclusive/defined error metric, so a graph having both levels of volatility is the more useful metric" are similarly useful to identify
        - relatedly, similar to problem-solving intents like 'identify spectrums with errors at the extremes in order to identify solutions/optimizations in the range in between extremes', 'identifying error structures that identify other structures containing enough variation/complexity/interface variables to possibly "cross an interface variable interaction threshold" which might be different enough to change it into a non-error structure' is a similar related intent that is a variant of that problem-solving intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'ratios relevant to definitions of a concept' to identify useful structures to apply for an intent
        - for example, its useful to identify 'differences in comparisons/ratios useful for intents' like filter/create/optimize ('ratios like averages/extremes' are useful for filtering, 'ratios of efficiency' are useful for optimizing, etc), since these ratios are ratios of components/other relevant structures of the definitions of these intents, and the 'structures in between the ratio and the intent' can be identified by applying these structures (ratio and intent) as 'limits of variation'
        - relatedly, graphs like 'layers of interface variables around interface variables' are useful as a "filter of a general 'interface variable connection' graph" to apply an iteration of 'specific interface similarities' before connecting an interface variable with other interface variables (where at some point the 'last useful layer to apply in an iteration' in between interface variables will be identifiable), where 'filters of graphs' are useful structures to identify, and where 'similarities in position in layers of interface variables around an interface variable' allow useful connections like 'similarities in requirements/definitions/structures' and therefore also 'similarities in requirements/definitions/structures with functions like creating connections across interface variables' (like a 'structural similarity in requirements' connecting 'inputs/components/descriptions') to be identified from this graph
        - relatedly, identifying structures like 'blur' which are associated with interface variables like 'abstraction' and identifying how similarities exist between structures ('blur' is associated with multiple specific generalities, like 'generality of shape/average/limits') and what differences can be created with these structures is useful to reflect possible 'interface similarities, ambiguity resolutions, and the similarity index network'
        - relatedly, identifying 'specifically useful structures' as in structures only useful for one intent or only useful in one structure like a 'sequence' or only useful in one system (in order to identify other structures which are useful for multiple intents) can be implemented by identifying variants of 'specifically useful structures' (one example variation is 'extremely specific structures' are more often only useful for one intent or in one structure or in one system) and 'exceptions to variants' like where 'extremely specific structures like "definitions" arent useful for only one intent' and 'components/inputs' of 'specifically useful structures' and other interface similarities of these structures

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs that are relevant to implement other graphs' by having some similar 'structure/interface/similarity/variation level' to fulfill intents like 'connect the graphs'
        - for example, the 'similarities between structures like concepts' can be identified with various graphs like the 'abstract concept definition graph' (where the similarities between concepts take the form of 'overlaps between definition networks of concepts') or the 'abstract-specific example graph' (where the similarities between concepts take the form of some ratio of 'specifications' or some ratio of 'specificity' that interacts with even the most irrelevant concepts like independent concepts), as a way of identifying the 'network of similarities' connecting each pair of interface structures like 'concepts' in a interface/similarity/workflow graph like that referenced in the previous workflow, where identifying the 'probably useful graphs' is a matter of identifying relevant graphs to the pair of concepts ('identifying graphs involving abstractions' or 'identifying graph with enough differences to be likely to interact with even irrelevant structures' or "identifying graphs with similarities between the original pair of concepts already built in using a different interface like 'definitions'")
        - relatedly, the 'real variant of a concept as the center of error/false variants' may be a useful way to visualize solution metrics and their errors, similar to how a graph of over-prioritizations like 'linearity/randomness/simplicity/complexity' have an optimal center

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs that can be optimized with interface structures like iterations' for intents like 'find useful graphs to solve problems with'
        - for example, a graph with connection similarities based on workflow functions/interface variables (a graph connecting interfaces like 'abstract/logic' by similarities that are useful for 'find/build/optimize/derive' workflow functions) can be iterated in a useful way (a graph of connections based on similarities between 'abstract changes and logical requirements and intent structures and structure specifications' optimized for 'find/build' workflow functions)
        - this graph is useful for 'filtering interface queries' (the graph will pre-filter the possible interface queries by these similarities between structures that fulfill workflow functions) and future useful interface queries will involve optimizing this graph by identifying new similarities to apply in the graph
            - identifying 'multiple alternate connections between nodes' (like how generate/cause are similar connections) is similarly useful for generating this graph
        - this graph would have different similarity structures like 'similarity sequences', 'similarity types (component/build similarities, reduce/specify/find similarities, etc)', interface similarities ('definition similarities') that create a 'similarity network' between each pair of interface variables/concepts

    - identifying useful structures like 'usefulness sequences/similarities' and 'useful graph variables' that can be used to 'identify new useful graphs or interface structures of graphs like graph types'
        - for example, a 'solution usage implementation graph' of optimal changes between solution usages/implementations is a useful graph with useful variants like 'solution usage priority' and 'solution usage intent', which I thought about when thinking about a 'solution variable graph' which would be useful to organize 'similarity of position' by 'which solutions are useful when another solution fails'
        - relatedly, 'partially identified graphs which would be trivial to complete once the partial identified connections are graphed' are useful to identify, like graphs of 'sets that are so small/specific' that graphing the already identified connections would have few remaining connections to identify which would likely be trivial to filter once the others are graphed (the remaining connections are connectible adjacently to the identified connections and the remaining connections are distributed among the identified connections so their correct position is likely to be trivial to derive)
        - relatedly, identifying 'most useful requirements/interface structures' is useful, which I thought about when thinking about how 'the most valuable core numbers like constants and limit numbers like infinity' are useful to identify first when 'identifying all useful specific numbers', at which point 'most useful requirements' was a step away given that 'requirements are related to limits', and similarly identifying the 'useful interactions of all these most useful structures' (interactions to answer queries like 'should the most useful requirements/limits/variables/etc always be applied first in a workflow') is useful
        - relatedly, 'iteration' isnt a built-in function of all neural networks in the sense of storing a 're-use node' and a 're-use count node' and other nodes of 'interface structures of interface structures' to apply operations like addition for example, where an 'equalizing function' (to change existing stored representative numbers to relevant numbers like those referenced in a problem) is a useful function to apply in combination with this node type, where the 'most similar numbers to numbers which are difficult to connect (so they occur in problems)' are useful to store
        - relatedly, the workflow of 'predict/generate' as in 'predict useful structures in a graph (with queries like what similarities would be useful if true and what differences applied to solution metrics can be connected to this graph and what will the core/base/connection/enabled/emergent similarities of the graph be)' and then 'generate the graph' is useful to apply as a 'input' type of vertex (predict useful structures, then use that as an input to generate a more optimal graph) where the functions are useful to apply not just in a combination but as inputs to the other function
        - relatedly, identifying 'what is not trivial on a graph' and 'whether that can be made trivial without invalidating the intents that were originally trivial in a graph' (whether the optimizations are mutually exclusive or overlap) are useful intents related to identifying useful graphs, and similarly, identifying 'what differences are possible with some base similarity and what similarities can be applied that fit in those open areas/structures' is a related useful intent related to identifying useful graphs, and 'matching graphs with queries that can be answered with those graphs (by identifying what comparisons can be run on a graph and what problems are solvable with those comparisons)' is a related useful intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'multiple-similarity reflecting similarities in a graph' and 'alignments in enabled structures of a base structure' as a 'relevant structure to identify in a graph'
        - for example, its useful to identify relevant structure in a 'graph of graphs' like 'graphs as tiles' like how a 'sequence of similar patterns in adjacent graphs' is relevant if the similarity is useful for some intent or otherwise reflects another similarity ('similarities that reflect multiple similarities' being a useful structure to identify), which involves 'identifying the ways that multiple similarities are possible to reflect in a structure on a graph'
            - the point of this is to identify unidentified similarities by 'identifying changes to the identified similarities like "multi-variable averages/other standards (like averages in position and structure)"' (and identifying differences in unidentified variation and identified similarities)
            - an example of 'reflecting multiple similarities' would be a 'cross-interface similarity' like a 'similarity in specificity/complexity'
            - relatedly, its possible to prioritize the 'most identifiable (easily verified) useful structures in a graph' like a 'graph that intersects with all other similarities in a grid on a tile graph' as a way to identify the 'maximally useful interface structures in a graph'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify 'relevant similarities/solution/interface structures that are enabled with a base similarity', like how a 'network of spectrums (like the abstract-specific graph)' allows other relevant interface structures like the 'range on a spectrum' and 'useful ranges on a spectrum' and 'filters of that range' and 'averages of that range' bc of the base spectrum, where other structures based on the graph like usages/queries can align with these structures (like 'filters of ranges that are useful for a common query')
            - this involves 'different ways of comparing/standardizing differences' (comparing different abstractions by structures like patterns of their specifications) than basic structures like 'spectrums' or by comparing different graphs, integrating multiple spectrums in one graph as aligned standards for comparison

    - identifying useful structures like 'relevant problem-solving intents of graphs' like 'identifying position/type/structure of an emergent similarity in a graph' or 'predicting graph similarities/patterns given interface structures of graphs (similar graphs, overlapping graphs, aligning graphs, configurations, queries etc)'
        - for example, rules like 'identify that there are enough bases (like concepts) that "similarities (like specifications) around bases" are trivial to identify patterns/structures in' for generating useful graphs like the 'abstract-specific graph' are useful rules to identify (patterns can be identified in any size of data, but there are clear lower limits that could be relevant given the number of concepts graphed which might be similar to that lower limit)
        - relatedly, 'identifying where the useful emergent pattern/similarity' is in a graph (and its inputs, configurations/variants, similarities to other graphs, queries/usages, optimizations, etc) is a useful problem-solving intent, similar to how 'predicting what the similarity is, given a graph description (like its inputs instead of the whole graph)' is a problem-solving intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs that can identify useful structures connecting solutions/errors' like 'various graphs of interface variables connected to solutions/errors'
        - for example, the graph of 'solution/error spectrums/sets connected with similarities' or the graph of 'patterns/structures of solutions/errors in aligned spectrum variables' or the graph of 'solutions/errors as a set of clusters to connect' or the graph of 'extremes of interface variables as errors in a network around center points like intents/concepts/structures/other interface structures' are useful graphs that could identify solution/error structures like patterns
        - relatedly, its useful to identify error structures of implementation errors of interface analysis like 'basing a similarity at a slightly incorrect position' and identifying what structure that takes and what indicators of that structure are useful as 'error signals'

    - identifying useful structures like 'reasons for graphs being optimized to find problem-solving structures like symmetries/similarities' as a way of implementing problem-solving intents like 'identifying unidentified similarities between problem/solution structures'
        - for example, the reason some graphs are useful is that they allow 'differences in a similarity' to be visualized in different ways (like a system layer diagram that allows 'differences within a layer to exist with similarities between layers' or a 2-d cluster graph with 'similarities allowed within clusters with differences maximized between clusters' or a abstract-specific graph with 'similarities between specific variants of a concepts to exist') where all the ways that these similarities/differences can be visualized is useful as a 'base set of graphs with different core similarities allowed' to apply to identify useful graphs, given that some graphs are useful for 'identifying undefined/unidentified similarities' which is a general problem-solving intent when applied to problem/solution structures (identifying unidentified similarities between problems/solutions), as a way of 'identifying/generating probably/definitely useful graphs'
            - relatedly, 'probably useful graphs' are graphs with a 'good chance of creating optimal intersections/interactions/similarities that are unidentified and relevant to a problem', indicating that 'some useful interactions are defined in the graph' and 'new variation is applied in the graph', indicating that 'optimal interactions can be potentially created by the graph', given 'variables that are defined to be or are probably relevant to a problem', like how 'variables in between extreme errors (irrelevant variables) may be relevant', where for example a 'difference in a similarity' may occupy one of these 'relevant positions in a graph of symmetries' so applying it to create a graph is useful

    - identifying useful structures like 'reference points of interface variable spectrums that intersect with workflows/queries' as a useful cross-interface alignment that can be used to 'filter workflows/queries' as an alternative to identifying 'interaction rules/variables of workflow filtering based on interface variables' (identify reference points to base workflow metric identifications on instead of identifying the abstract similarities/variables governing interactions between interface variables and workflows)
        - for example, identifying connections between reference points of intersections with interface spectrums like 'info' and workflows is useful, like how 'non-zero info' maps to workflows that use info like 'change a base solution', then 'sequences of workflows' apply as the 'info spectrum value increases', as in 'higher info' workflows like 'identify maximally different base solutions' and 'identify useful directions in "graphs of solutions as nodes" that move toward possible/probable optimal points for solution metrics' and 'apply specific solution metrics for a base solution to optimize the solution', which is a useful 'cross-interface alignment' to identify
            - relatedly, identifying the 'average ratio of abstraction useful across problems' is useful as a 'base ratio to start from', and a 'network of related averages' is similarly useful as a 'ratio network' or 'range network', since 'averages often impact each other by their commonness'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify cross-interface similarities in interface variables (like 'positive vs. negative structures') for different intents (to identify 'what metrics differentiate positive/negative structures for a specific workflow') which will integrate 'positive/negative structure definitions' such as 'definitions of usefulness' but will also integrate other interface structures like 'specific structural interface structures', forming 'cross-interface similarities' to identify possible positive/negative structures like 'new positive/negative definitions' using indirectly defined metrics

    - identifying useful structures like 'input/indicators of similarities in cross-interface structures like intent/structure similarities' which are useful for intents like 'identifying relevant graphs'
        - for example, identifying useful graph changes like 'opposites' that maintain some useful structures like the 'specific hub-abstract leaf graph' as opposed to the 'abstract hub-specific leaf graph' and identifying similarities in changes that are still useful for an intent like how the 'opposite graph may be useful for the opposite intent' (similarity in the 'graph/intent change')
        - relatedly, other intents like 'filtering a range' exist which can identify useful graph structures like 'identifying maximally different graphs as base solutions' (for 'filter/base' workflows)
        - relatedly, identifying similarities like symmetries as 'certainty' structures since 'similar even with changes' guarantees some 'change ratio/type' is useful for certainty-related intents
            - relatedly, identifying similarities/differences similar to symmetries (as 'similar even with changes') such as 'similar/different even with other interface structures like requirements (like requirements to be different/similar)' as an alternative type of symmetry as a 'change-invariant' certainty structure, similar to how 'different with changes' and 'different or similar with changes' are alternative structures to symmetries
        - relatedly, identifying the abstract similarity in an algorithm/network (like the 'similarity between the first/second halves of a sentence in a transformer') and identifying 'whether that abstract similarity has an identifiable set of patterns that explain the variation in the two sides of the similarity' or 'whether there might be other patterns which are derivable given other interaction/connection types between the halves' and 'whether the similarity is reflected in other variables more accurately/optimally or if its complementary info to other variables' is useful to identify 'sets/networks of similarities' that are useful to organize in a meta-network (identifying whether similarities in available data can reflect identified real variation)

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph sets of multiple solution/interface metrics' which fulfill intents like 'identifying upper/lower ranges of relevant graphs in the set'
        - for example, identifying graph sets like 'sets of graphs with similarities based on multiple solution metrics or interface variables' which are useful for intents like 'identifying a relevant graph to make comparisons with' bc this set of graphs will be useful for identifying 'upper/lower ranges' on various spectrum variables to identify the 'area/range of the probably relevant graph' for most problems, which applies subsets of this set of graphs as different bases to apply changes to (to identify the upper/lower range to differentiate from)
        - relatedly, 'graph sequences/directions/positions that fulfill "create/require/connect/other functions" of similarities' are useful to identify, since 'similarity-applying graphs that identify useful differences/similarities' are useful to identify and the inputs to 'relevant similarities' are known and can be used to generate increasingly relevant similarity/difference-based graphs from a base graph
        - similarly, identifying the 'upper/lower range of complexity' required to connect 'graphs' with 'patterns findable in graphs' is useful ('applying the similarity to create a graph' and 'applying the similarities like patterns possible to find in a graph' and 'applying connections between these functions applied from different directions'), since the 'upper/lower range of complexity' is likely to be findable in a graph by identifying what simple/complex patterns are not findable in the graph (which can represent an 'upper/lower range of complexity findable in a graph')

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph/similarity alignments' that are useful for intents like 'identifying useful structures like combinations/sequences of similarities/graphs to find a structure (like specifications related to a concept)'
        - for example, identifying 'base similarities that identify other similarities' like how a 'set of intersecting spectrums' that identifies a 'ring of concepts which can be superimposed on another graph' to 'identify specifications of those concepts (the abstract-specific graph)' is a useful graph sequence that identifies a base similarity of the ring of concepts and then identifies similarities related to that base similarity like the specifications of concepts
        - relatedly, identifying that a 'connection exists (some similarity is established, where equivalence is not established and randomness is filtered out)' and the 'connection is not any other connection type (is not an input/output/base/filter/requirement/other interface structure of the other)' is a proof method to identify 'whether a connection is an equivalence connection'
        - relatdly, another reason that 'filter/generate' is a vertex (useful to apply in combination) is specifically that they can 'create useful inputs to the other function in the set', rather than just being useful to combine in general ('identifying specific info' to apply as input to 'generate changes to' where those changes are reflective of reality bc of the input info, which implies the workflow 'change a base solution' bc the identified info is a solution to intents like 'identify true connections')

    - identifying useful structures like 'specifications of useful graphs that directly connect to problem/solution structures' is useful for intents like 'generating/filtering interface queries' by 'querying similarities between problem-solving intents and graphs'
        - for example, identifying a 'problem type to specific solution query network' as a specification of the 'abstract-specific graph' is useful to identify directly relevant graphs to 'problem-solving intents', and similarly a 'similarity index network' where the core similarities indicate the 'most common/abstract starting points of interface queries/workflows' is useful as a graph to implement interface queries to direct changes/steps on the graph toward solution structures like problem-solving functions/workflows, which is possible with queries like 'identify similarities between a graph (like the abstract-specific graph) and problem/solution structures' which would identify 'problem types as simulatable with abstract concepts and solution-finding functions/queries/workflows as useful specifications of problem types' and 'problem spaces and specific solution subsets of the problem spaces' as aligning with an 'abstract-specific graph' structure

    - identifying useful structures like 'networks of structures to identify graphs' like 'alignments between specific spectrums' being a useful network to identify a 'general relevance graph spectrum'
        - for example, implementing a 'relevance spectrum of graphs' is possible by identifying 'alignments of specific relevance spectrums' (specific relevance spectrums like 'number of problem-solving intents a graph is useful for' which can be identified by finding overlaps between useful graphs across intents)

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs of structures like limits/ranges of relevance structures for a problem (with variables like implicitness such as whether relevance is specified or implemented in the graph)' to identify 'similarity indexes of relevance structures across problems'
        - for example, identifying relevance graphs is useful, such as how its useful to identify a graph that implements a 'spectrum of relevance' and related structures like 'useful points/ranges on a spectrum of relevance' by identifying 'more/less relevant structures related to a problem' and the 'similarities (like patterns of these structures) on some connecting variable that aligns with relevance', which identifies a problem-solving intent like 'identify more/less relevant structures and identify a graph where they have different directions'
            - for example, 'optimizing for a metric like interactivity' can be done by identifying 'graphs that implement multiple optimization metrics' and identifying 'directions of graphs that implement more optimization metrics' which will likely 'intersect with a graph that optimizes for interactivity' by default at some point
        - relatedly, other useful graph structures include 'layered spectrums of or on graphs' like 'similarity index networks' that can be found in a graph
        - identifying problems of 'unidentified interface structures' (like 'unknown range' like an 'unknown error function minimum') that can be solved with 'approximate identifiers' like 'local extremes' is useful to identify connections between problems/solutions, where 'extremes' are connected with 'ranges' as an identifier
        - relatedly, identifying the 'reason for relevance/usefulness' of 'common graph query trajectories/patterns' like 'complexity graph patterns' (like how 'over-complicating a system' is a 'common intent on an optimization trajectory' and how its useful for intents like 'identifying a more useful degree of simplification' and 'identifying useful variation and identifying more errors given the higher variation complex variant of a graph given that its more likely to be incorrect in multiple structures than one')
        - relatedly, identifying the 'most useful graph of interfaces' (involving some inclusion/implementation of specific system rule sets like 'physics') is possible to identify with 'networks of base graphs like physics that can generate other graphs like biology' which can be implemented by applying 'starting point graphs' as certainties such as 'applying specific base graphs like physics as starting points to base "variation of connections and resulting interfaces" on'

    - identifying useful structures like 'ratios (representing complete type sets) which can be used as "filters of areas in graphs"' which is useful to identify 'probabilities/identities of structures based on those types'
        - for example, identifying 'ratios of abstract variables like "ratios of positive/negative structures"' is useful as a way of 'identifying the probability of a structure of either type', since these type sets describe all structures through being a 'complete set' and being values on an interface variable spectrum, which I thought of when identifying variables that are 'neither variable/constant' on the '2-d concept similarity cluster graph' such as variables like 'solution/error or positive/negative' which are independent of the clusters, and which can be used to 'filter the space of concept combinations'
        - relatedly, given the similarity represented by solution structures like 'ratios/ranges/averages/base solutions/networks', the same similarities applied to problem structures will likely identify intersections to connect these problem/solution 'ratios/ranges/averages/bases/other similarity structures'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify 'similarities (like intersections) between concepts' as 'starting points' for identifying 'standardized differences' based on those similarities
        - relatedly, its useful to identify 'all possible optimal interactions of structural similarities like "ratios/ranges/averages/bases/networks"' (like optimal 'bases of ratios of ranges', and interactions of these structures with graphs like 'ratios of similarities probable on a similarity index network', etc) to identify 'sets/combinations/structures of solution structures' that match a problem type and 'structures of structural similarities' that are already optimized for a problem type or in general, given that useful structures like 'concepts/solution metrics/interface variables' can be standardized to these 'structural similarity' structures (given that they encode 'similarities/comparisons') and the optimal interactions of some of these structures like 'ratios/ranges' of 'concepts/variables' already identified with concept definitions
            - this is useful to identify 'useful/optimal comparisons on a graph' like 'ratio of pattern-compliant solutions/non-compliant solutions' or 'ratio of solution/error areas on a graph' as well as connecting useful solution metrics like 'efficiency' with similarity structures like 'ratios' for a specific 'set of graphs'

    - identifying useful structures 'created by similarities like "redundancies"' which can reduce the work of 'connecting problem/solution structures'
        - for example, identifying similarities that create 'redundancies' is useful, such as how identifying that an 'alternating sequence of integers' creates a requirement that it must be 'even/odd integer sequences', so the info of 'even/odd integer sequences' is redundant, given the 'sequence of similarities' containing nodes like 'alternating sequences of integers' and 'even/odd integer sequences', where its useful to identify these 'sequences/structures of similarities' as useful to identify for intents like 'minimizing identification work (reducing "identification" intents to "identifying which sequence a similarity is an item of")' by identifying 'variation' in a structure that can create 'alternate similar variants that are useful to connect' (identify variation in an 'alternating sequence set of integers' that can identify other variables like 'evenness' without changing the original structure)
        - this is a structure of obviousness (redundancies are trivial to identify) that is also an irrelevance structure (redundancies are a type of irrelevant structure) and an 'irrelevant specification' (specifying the exact sequences is irrelevant once there is a unique identifier of the sequences like 'alternating integers')

    - identifying useful structures like the 'variants of a graph related to its relevant interactions' that are necessary to 'identify an optimal variant of a graph like an "solution metric optimization" graph'
        - for example, identifying that multiple graph variants are useful in solving the problem of 'identifying a network graph that implements a set of interaction rules' (like 'saving/killing rules') which applies a 'fairness' metric for example, where one graph like a graph of 'fairness for a criminal' wouldnt be sufficient to implement 'general fairness in a group' bc it leaves out graphs like 'fairness for non-criminals', as well as graphs indicating usability of fairness graphs (even when an optimal set of rules is identified, sometimes it cant be used) and 'graphs about the impact/interactions of one fairness graph on other fairness graphs' like a graph of 'societal/general fairness for the group' or the 'graph of definitions of fairness' as well as 'graphs of different usages of different fairness graphs in different cases' and 'graphs of the optimization potential of fairness graphs', and this set of graphs is more usable to identify 'graphs implementing real fairness' as well as 'solution metric networks of variables that create fairness'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'graph that uses the other graphs the best' and the 'graph that impacts other graphs the most' and other useful graph types are useful as specific variants of solution metrics for the problem of 'identifying the most useful set of graphs'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'graph of data set subset graphs or adjacent data set graphs' where the graphs with 'low volatility' or 'linear connections' have some similarity which makes identifying them trivial is a useful application of 'graphs of graphs' to identify solution metric patterns/input patterns
        - this is useful for connecting 'networks of base solutions like identified optimal metrics like "fairness"' which have requirements/other interface structures of their interactions which impact optimal variants of each individual graph

    - identifying useful structures like 'graphs of optimal solution/error connections like where solutions are more trivially connectible than errors' to fulfill specific implementations of 'general problem-solving intents related to solution/error connections' like 'increasing the probability of identifying a solution with adjacent changes to a solution'
        - for example, identifying useful applications of workflows is useful, such as how its useful to apply 'trial and error' when identifying solutions in high uncertainty spaces like 'trying every possible graph of solutions/errors where solutions have different similarity structures like similarity combinations like adjacence (near some average or limit) or connection to some base (like above some threshold)' to identify the graph where solutions have consistent similarities or where 'solutions have some optimal connection to errors' (like 'solutions have some constant distance from errors or are surrounded by errors that are separable by this limit' to fulfill some intent like 'adjacent changes to solutions create other solutions more often than errors' which applies a 'probability ratio of identifying solutions from another solution' given the uncertainty in some complex graph which makes a probability useful)

    - identifying useful structures like 'useful solution/error graphs like applying conceptual or cross-interface "opposites/filters" to solution structures to connect them to error structures'
        - for example, identifying cross-interface connections that can be connected to solutions (like how 'balance' is an input concept and 'contain' is an input structure to workflows based on solution 'ranges', or how 'power/cause' is an input concept and sequences/interactions are an input structure to workflows based on solution generation as in solution inputs like 'solution metrics') is useful to identify 'alternate solution structures to connect' (like connecting solution ranges/sets/sequences/types/metrics, such as identifying 'solution ranges across different sets of solution metrics')
            - similarly, applying equivalence/connection structures like 'position on a requirement/definition sequence' or 'the other side of a filter' such as how the 'opposite of opposite' of a solution structure (like 'filtering out outliers') is a similar alternative to the 'identify probable solution range' intent, similar to how 'identifying averages' is similar to the 'identify probable solution range' intent bc theyre similar in info content but different in 'position on a sequence' or 'the other side of a filter' connecting these structures
            - similarly, 'connections between opposing cross-interface structures' (like 'abstract generators and specific limits' or 'general solutions and specific errors') are useful to identify as a set to apply as 'reality-covering connections', similar to how 'connections between reality-covering graphs/grids' are useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying cross-interface solutions/errors like 'cross-interface volatility' is useful to identify default cross-interface errors to avoid in cross-interface structures
        - relatedly, identifying error variables like 'volatility' as an alternate solution/error connection function input (whats the error/volatility variant of solutions/balance, whats the volatile way to connect solution/error structures)
        - relatedly, identifying 'directed/positional/count (1-n and n-n)/other structures of interface connections' (like how every intent can be connected to every error type) is useful as an 'input to identifying/generating useful graphs'
        - relatedly, identifying 'different useful solution types' is useful, like 'solutions that are right for an alternative intent even when incorrect for the original intent'
        - relatedly, intents related to a time machine include: 'replaying subsets of subsets of reality sequences' and 'replaying for every perspective vs. locally or for the experiencer vs. the observer', identifying tools like graphs to 'create adjacent connections between everything' as a way to apply any set of changes on a sequence, tools to 'identify useful start/end points on a sequence to check or start/stop at' (identifying the points that are useful to replay in reality vs. in a computer), identifying 'graphs of connections to understand possible/required sequences' and 'reasons to apply connections to change position in a sequence' (like that replaying a 'change sequence wont invalidate any required structures and may contain useful variation'), 'identify change sequences that fulfill requirements to create stability', 'adding reality by making some structure more interactive/meaningful' or 'adding reality by making a structure more common or rare or otherwise different on some interface variable', 'identifying alternate ways that time could end bc these will invalidate any planned change sequence (identifying the ways that computers/technologies/interfaces could cause enough chaos or lack of change or other errors to end the universe)', and 'sequences that maintain or increase relevance during the sequence (such as by being reversible or self-referential or self-proving)' are 'units of time', and 'identifying useful reality descriptions' is similar to 'moving faster than other types of time' (related to 'simulating reality better than reality')
            - once 'equivalence/relevance' is solved, 'alternate/coordinating optimal meaningful variants' of reality (which 'allow new variation to be sustained') can be identified/connected/applied by some organizing structure
        - relatedly, 'active graphs of some allowed change type like optimizations or trivial changes' are useful as a higher dimensional graph interface like queries/usages/layers/alignments/emergent similarities/manifolds/optimizations of the graph, to enable new query types like 'queries while the graph is optimized' or 'queries that reduce a graph to a more accurate, simpler variant while being implemented'

    - identifying useful structures like 'in/validating variants of interface variable structures' that retain the 'meaning of the core/interface variant similarities' of the original connection is useful to 'identify alternate testable variants'
        - for example, identifying relevant structures like 'combinations' of useful variables to transform a connection that 'retain the relevant similarities' like 'reverse' that applies to identify 'variants of a sequence' like 'variants of an input/output sequence' (like identifying if inputs to an infinitely alternating type interaction can create the even/odd sequence set, similar to how identifying if the sequence set can be used to fulfill some requirement for an infinitely alternating type interaction) or 'abstract' which applies if the abstract type is 'relevant to the similarity' of the original connection, or 'proving the opposite is false as in the "opposite of opposite" ("not" the relevant "differences" like "opposites" of the connection)', where these transforms of a connection can be applied to retain the original relevance/meaning of the connection, and where some of these transforms violate the original meaning in some combination/sequence/structure, such as how proving that 'abstractions of components of a connection' may allow too much variation from the original connection to still be relevant/true
            - relatedly, identifying that the structures of a connection are 'not equivalent to some independent variable' is similarly useful as a variant of 'proving the opposite is false'
            - relatedly, identifying a 'unit of truth' and other structures of truth are relevant as connection-verifying intents, as well as 'identifying similarities in structures creating truth/falsehood ratios and differentiating these from more certain/useful variants like absolute or unitary connections'
            - alternately, identifying that a 'reference point sequence' (of subsets of infinite that can be combined to create infinity, which are less computationally complex to verify) holds infinitely is another possible variant to prove instead of the original connection, like proving that more testable factors of infinity apply to some transform of the infinite sequences, such as how 'number types' tend to be infinite so they could be applied as 'inputs/descriptors of infinity'
        - relatedly, identifying equivalences can be useful to identify 'interactions using those equivalences that are more testable', such as how subtracting one sequence from another identifies a more testable sequence like 'alternating ones/zeros', which is useful in that it "isolates a 'relevant standardized difference' required to prove the 'alternating' factor" and can be more easily tested, which is possible bc of their 'relative equivalence, which makes the output more trivial to predict, more general by being standardized, more unitary and therefore more usable in tests'
        - relatedly, starting to identify a graph by 'graphing identified solutions as in a different/opposite position of errors' is an example of applying 'identified differences/similarites to start generating a graph from', which is useful to iterate by 'identifying these graphs of how to differentiate solutions/errors across different problem types' and 'applying that to identify common connection structures of solutions/errors'
            - relatedly, the structure of 'differentiating solutions/errors' is related to the structure of 'differentiating from an upper/lower range/area containing a solution' by identifying 'opposite errors (like opposing directions of errors)', where identifying other interface variables like 'differences (like opposing directions)' of error interactions is similarly useful, which can be implemented by identifying 'solution graphs' and 'error graphs' to similarize to/differentiate from which can act like a 'range' if a 'useful direction of change from the solution graph' is identified and if 'differentiating from only one of the error/solution graphs' is not sufficient so both are required to differentiate from, or similarly an 'error graph and an opposite error graph of different errors' can act like a 'graph range'

    - identify useful structures like 'workflows created with interface variables/functions that dont violate similarities like uses (such as graphs of graphs) of similarities'
         - for example, identifying workflows like 'reverse ("identify all items of a solution type", rather than "connect problem to a specific solution in the solution set"), then abstract (identify graph/similarity of graphs/similarities)' (reverse the workflow 'identify intersections from adjacent changes' by applying 'identify adjacent changes to intersections until connections with problem structures are identified', then identify 'a graph of graphs (an abstraction)' by identifying 'similarities of similarity intersections', which uses the intersections identified/applied in the first workflow) which can connect useful structures like 'similarity intersections' and 'similarities of similarity intersections' (like 'number of cross-interface variables (like "extreme iteration/scale and a direction change" or a "direction reversal and an abstraction like a graph")' usually required to connect useful similarities like 'similarity intersections') by applying 'reverse, then abstract', which is a useful connection to identify that 'doesnt violate the similarities involved' (it 'uses' the similarities rather than 'invalidating' them), so identifying 'possible (non-changing, non-invalidating) uses of similarities in interface variables/functions' (the graph of similarity intersections uses the similarity intersections in a way that doesnt invalidate their differences/similarities) is a way to identify useful workflows
        - relatedly, the possibility of 'pathogen suppression with supplements, until relevant thresholds like organ replacement thresholds are reached, as a possible treatment' is an example of 'identifying useful cross-interface intersections'
            - relatedly, 'problems with car-t therapy' like 'negative outcomes of combined/compounding immune changes like overuse of immune system and invalidation of useful existing structures by these immune changes' are useful to identify as 'probable general error sources' and connect with 'possible applications/variants/interactions' of the treatment
        - relatedly, a useful graph similar to the 'abstract/specific' graph is the 'abstract combination graph connected with specific intents or general problem-solving intents rather than specific problem structures or specific examples of the abstraction' (to identify ways that each 'concept combination' can be specified to be used to fulfill problem-solving intents and ideally also 'identify concept combinations that are more adjacent to each specific problem-solving intent')
        - relatedly, the problem of 'identifying whether there is another useful core/unit constant to find' can be solved by 'matching variation in the core interface with variation in general interface variables' to predict the probability of another useful structure in the core interface, and identifying where these 'variation matches' dont apply is similarly useful to identify the 'limits of relevant usages of this intent'
            - relatedly, identifying similarities between 'variation of what solutions have already been identified/tried' and 'variation in other optimal solutions or solutions to other problems' can identify the 'probability of another optimal solution in a variation area'
        - relatedly, 'filter gap alignment' is a useful structure to identify with graphs of interactive structures like 'software components', which can be applied with structures like 'rare/error/irrelevant' specifications of a type to identify the 'error interactions' ('rare error interactions' are more useful to predict than other interactions which are likely already identified or handled)
        - relatedly, 'specificity similarity/matching' is useful as a way to identify specific connections/solutions (as in 'a specific system will be able to be applied as a proof structure of specific connections') indicating that 'identifying a solution with some variable' can be done by 'identifying some system with that variable', which identifies 'identifying structures (like combinations or sequences) of these variables as useful structures of these variables to match' as a useful intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'standards intersections' that are useful for reasons like 'similarity in change reasons/structures (like correlated changes)' which can be used to find useful structures like 'solution ranges' with the 'correlated changes across standards'
        - for example, 'intersections/similarities of standards/similarities' like 'slope similarity and subset/superset or size similarity' are a structure that can be used to find 'upper/lower solution range structures', since the 'slope similarity of subsets/supersets or adjacent sizes of sequence steps' can create a 'relevant upper/lower range creating a solution requirement', which is useful bc these similarities align (the slope 'changes similarly' to how the step size or subset/superset of the original sequence changes) and they intersect with the original connection values by being 'continuous changes'
        - relatedly, its useful to connect 'standardization and requirements', such as how a 'alternating even/odd sequence set' is a standardized sequence set (with irrelevant differences removed and simple similarities remaining, compared to most sequence sets) and this standardization creates 'higher similarity to requirements of the definition of the components'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify 'useful network changes' like 'switching adjacent connections' to apply 'similar differences' to identify 'adjacent useful graphs that could be relevant', like where switching adjacent connections is justified bc other adjacent structures are also likely to be interactive in some way other than already identified connections
        - relatedly, its useful to identify 'relevance distance areas' of structures that are 'different/similar enough to be useful to compare'

    - identifying useful structures like 'networks that are useful/possible to align like problem/solution interaction networks'
        - for example, networks of 'solution/problem interactions' are useful to identify, such as how 'networks connecting a specific type of solution like simple solutions' (like how simple apps like 'simple APIs/web sites' have 'interaction optimization rules' that differ from interaction rules of complex solutions), which can identify 'routes/indicators to/of simple solutions', and are useful to connect to other 'solution type interaction networks' as well as 'problem interaction networks' like networks of 'error structures of problems' like 'an error associated with complex solutions required by a problem, or a replication error of a problem in alternative contexts or from alternative sources' and align them with these solution networks (the 'solution network' aligning with this 'problem error network' will have a path for preventing an error like 'a replication of a problem')
        - relatedly, identifying alternate connection structures like 'true similarities as differences from false similarities' is useful in proving connections like how proving a difference from a false similarity between 'some alternating sequence set and infinity' is useful for identifying an infinitely alternating sequence set, bc of the 'info reflected' in the 'difference from the false similarity', as 'some structures seem infinite but arent', and 'differentiating from these possible errors (false variants)' is useful for proving a connection is true

    - identifying useful structures like 'areas of similar relevance of interface queries' is useful for intents like 'filtering interface queries'
        - for example, 'structures of equivalent relevance' (of interface structures like interface queries) is useful to identify 'similarly relevant and irrelevant/independent alternatives to interface structures' used in interface queries, such as how 'a set of interface structures may be equivalent in different cases' which I thought of when thinking about 'relevant similarities' as a core component of interface queries, which can be done in reverse by identifying 'areas that should be similarly relevant' and building the 'remainder of the graph around that initial similarity area'
        - relatedly, organization structures applied to graphs like 'rings of graphs' are useful for identifying emergent similarities (like 'adjacent function patterns') within that core similarity like an 'alignment of graphs' which are possible in that graph format, and similarly, new graphs can be identified by 'identifying multiple core similarities and connecting them in graphs that allow multiple similarities in interface structures like embeddings'
        - relatedly, 'identifying equivalent alternative connections to prove' can take the form of 'identifying that a subset/superset variant of the connection is true, where the subset/superset is sufficiently adjacent to identify requirements of the original connection' (for example 'prove that the integer sequence is infinite and that half of it can be identified by the even sequence and the other half is required to be the odd sequence, and half of infinity is still infinity, bc of the "info reflected" in proving that one sequence is infinite and requires the opposite of the other', or 'prove that the even sequence alternates infinitely, and has the same gap between adjacent pairs that could only be fulfilled by the equivalent alternate sequence having the opposite identifying variable, as in the odd sequence' which are both examples of identifying 'requirements of the original connection' through identifying adjacent structures)

    - identifying useful structures like the 'relevance range of coverage of intent/type/interface structures (a range that contains the actual coverage ratio)' is useful as an alternate graph of solutions ('range of intents/types/interface structures covered by a specific structure, on a graph of these intents/types/structures by similarity')
        - for example, identifying a upper/lower range of relevance for a base solution is useful, such as how 'base solutions for cancer' (like 'turmeric') cover 'some uncertain ratio of intents/types' that is not all intents/types and is not zero, so filtering this range to specify it further by identifying a more relevant 'upper/lower range of relevance' is possible/useful, like identifying the 'relevance range that contains the actual intent/type/interface coverage ratio' of other useful structures like 'workflows/intents/graphs' is useful

    - identify useful structures like 'connectible info sets like "general type requirements and specific requirements" which is connectible with specific filters like "patterns/similarities of specific differences from general truths"'
        - for example, identifying a 'general variant of the connection is required' is an approximation of a 'specific connection being required', such as how identifying that 'at least one example of the type "alternating set of sequences that is infinite"' is 'required by other definitions' is useful for identifying 'whether a specific alternating set is infinite' bc the requirement of the general type being true indicates the possibility that a 'specific set (indicated by the original connection to prove) is an item in the general type set that has at least one required true connection (at least one item in that general type makes the statement true bc of the requirement determined by other definitions), which involves identifying intents like 1. 'identify if at least one connection of a type is required' and 2. 'identify if the original connection is of that type' and 3. 'identifying if the original connection is that required connection' as connectible in a useful way for proving a connection, reducing the problem to 'connecting the previous intents 2/3 with additional filters' given the variation between them, so the new problem to solve once its identified that 'there must be at least one connection of this type' is 'prove that the original connection is one of the items of that type'
            - this applies an abstraction to the workflow 'identify if the "original connection" is required', with a resulting variant of 'identifying if "at least one item of the general type connection" is required (there must be at least one infinite alternating sequence set)', which is connectible to the original connection with filters if true (like by filters to identify'patterns/similarities of at least one item being true and the rest of the set being false' and by 'patterns/similarities of at least one item being true and other ratios of items being true')
                - similarly a 'generally true requirement' is similarly useful to identify, which is connectible to the original connection by 'patterns/similarities of specific differences from generally true connections'
            - similarly, identifying that the 'interface variant of a connection is true' for every interface variable except the original one and that the original interface variable doesnt contain enough variation/limits/barriers to prevent the connection or change it from the other variants is similarly useful, just like identifying 'cases where one interface variant is false and the others are true' is useful as 'complementary info'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'limits of similarities' is useful, such as how a basic problem-solving sequence for solving cancer means connecting 'food/herbs -> genes -> tumor functions', and a proxy for 'gene info' is 'immune signals (which store/use/change that gene info) such as feelings/cravings', so 'trying every type of food and checking if immune system creates a craving for a food type, given a cancer type' is an alternative problem-solving sequence, similar to how 'identifying food types by impact on symptoms/feelings (like pro/anti-inflammatory substances) and trying every food type for impact on tumor functions' is an alternative problem-solving sequence which doesnt require 'gene info' to work bc the 'gene info' is reflected in 'symptoms/feelings/cravings, that are connected to food/herb types', and the 'limit of the similarity' between 'immune signals and gene info' is useful to identify so 'useful variants of this similarity can be identified by those limits', similar to how 'identifying the structures that can cross possibility "spectrum value limits" (variables that can make an impossible connection possible/probable/required and vice versa)' are useful to make the original connection possible/probable/required in some system if its not already
        - relatedly, identifying 'higher optimality states (more optimal than a solution to a specific problem)' like 'cases/systems where a solution to a problem is not needed anymore or at all' is useful to connect to a problem (like where 'systems/variables/functions creating the problem are not needed or interacted with at all bc independent alternative systems are used instead') bc these very different states 'have high info content that is very different from the problem (a state where a problem is invalid/not required is likely very different from a problem system) that can be connected to a problem', possibly 'crossing/enabling solutions while being connected', similar to how queries about 'what would be useful' are useful to connect to a problem bc it will likely 'cross/enable a solution while being connected to the problem', so 'identifying structures that will likely intersect with/enable solutions while being connected (like upper/lower bounds, high variation/info states, maximal differences, useful structures, averages of types, etc)' is a useful intent

    - identify useful structures like 'coordinating sets of structures like "ranges/relative positions" on spectrums' that are equal/similar/different from 'true connection structures' like 'absolute/stable/regular equivalences'
        - for example, related to the problem of proving that 'even/odd sequences alternate infinitely', identifying spectrums related to alternate connections to prove like 'prove the position/range on the requirement spectrum (prove that its somewhere between defined and probable)' or 'prove that the connected variables are at least not independent/irrelevant (prove that the alternating sequences arent unconnectible to/independent of infinite series) and are connected in other ways that are relevant like "input connections to the relevant connection"' and 'prove the similarity is not an equivalence or difference (the sequences alternate but never merge or diverge)' or 'prove that the structures relevant to the required difference (prove that theyre non-overlapping, bc non-overlapping is relevant to alternating) are connected' is useful, where this 'set of spectrums like independence/requirement/similarity' can intersect in ways that complement each other (if its 'more dependent than independent or definitely not unconnectible/independent', 'more than probable' as in 'definitely proven to some degree/ratio', and 'not equivalent or opposite, as in relevantly similar', that set of spectrum values may sum to a proof, depending on the problem space as in 'how many alternatives exist in the irreducible uncertainty space of possible solutions' which is filterable with these interface variable spectrums)
            - this is related to the identifying the 'required point on the abstract/specific spectrum' to identify the 'level of specification required to solve a problem', similar to how identifying the 'variation level required to solve a problem is useful', where identifying enough of these points on spectrums can determine the solution or otherwise reduce the solution set
        - relatedly, identifying structures that are 'too (error) general (interface variable) to be complete (completeness being a solution metric)' (an error applied to an interface variable to invalidate a solution metric) is an example of an error structure that can be applied across problems to check for useful interactions/errors ('what level of specificity is required to indicate complete identification' is a query that can be created using this error structure in a way that is relevant to this example proof problem in order to filter interface queries to solve the problem)
        - relatedly, identifying structures like similarities/patterns/spectrums in 'solution optimality spectrums' is useful to identify, to identify 'solution metrics that co-occur bc theyre related/adjacent on this grid' and 'connections to more optimal co-occurring solution metrics'

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between useful graphs and useful similarities possible with those graphs' and 'connections between useful similarities and useful problems/solutions related to those similarities'
        - identifying useful graphs with useful similarities like graphs like 'interface variable (like complexity/variation/abstraction) spectrum graphs of relevance, connecting structures like "low-relevance graphs/clusters/values"' and 'interface variable spectrum graphs of interface variables (like volatility)' which allow useful similarities like 'relevant (subset of adjacent interactive metrics/graphs) and/or absolute (across all metrics/graphs) solution metric connections' to be identified for a problem, given some subset of known specific/general solution metrics like 'complexity'
            - for example, a 'relevance value spectrum graph' can connect more structures than just 'different values of relevance', such as connecting 'low-relevance structures like low-relevance graphs/clusters/sets', and relevant structures on that graph might have a similarity with relevant structures on another graph ('low-relevance structures might overlap with low-complexity structures', creating a "similarity/connection across graphs" that can be used for 'implementing/filtering queries'), and this similarity might be useful for filtering interface queries, such as 'identifying structures that implement a high ratio of a set of solution metric values' (to avoid queries that find these structures with less efficient workflows)
            - relatedly, connecting "concept graphs" to "graphs implementing those concepts, invalidating those concepts, using those concepts, and other interface function applications of those concepts, etc" (like 'graphs that implement a power/balance connection/spectrum/overlap') is a useful connection set to identify
        - relatedly, identifying irrelevant neutral/independent metrics (non-solution or error metrics) is useful as a set of variables to connect to identify 'irrelevance-relevance limits/connections/structures', since irrelevant variables are 'less connected/relevant variables' which can be more connected/relevant

    - identifying useful structures like 'spectrum/graph/sequences errors (like limits/extensions)' which can be useful for optimizing intents like 'rather than identifying a specific implementation of a concept, identify a new abstraction that is more useful to specify' by 'extending a conceptual spectrum like abstraction', as well as identifying 'alternate inputs to reflective similarities' like abstract variants of 'determination potential as a function of causal sequence adjacency and similar variation'
        - example of identifying variables that are 'sufficiently connected' to reflect/specify/identify each other most of the time ('function components/variables' and 'function types/ranges/sets') by being 'determining/limiting/causative' ('variable sets' determine/limit 'function types')
            - 'function variable sets' (curvature, volatility) -> 'function types/ranges/sets' (exponential, above a threshold, all functions with an n coefficient term)
            - the 'determination/limitation potential' comes from 'adjacency in causal/interactive sequence' and 'similar complexity/variation in the two variable sets' ('function components/variables' and 'function types/ranges/sets')
            - abstracting this is useful as a general problem-solving workflow (identifying what abstract/interface variants of 'determination/limitation potential' caused by abstract/interface variants of 'adjacency in causal/interactive sequence' and 'similar complexity/variation in the two variable sets that identify each other'), where 'variants of determination/limitation potential' are used to identify 'reflective variable sets (abstract/interface similarities/symmetries)' that can be 'connected, so that one set can be used to identify/generate the other set'
            - an example of a useful application of this connection type is identifying 'relevant similarities/differences' by identifying 'relevance components/variables'
            - at some point, relevance as in 'comparisons to most human intents' will be solved so that the only remaining relevance is 'comparisons to uncertainties/complexities' which can be solved for first
            - once comparisons are solved (everything is compared to everything, such as 'every variable is compared to every graph that could be relevant'), 'organizing structures to invalidate comparison requirements' is the next useful intent, which can be solved for first
            - applying 'reflective similarities' to intents like 'identifying all comparisons' and 'organizing to avoid comparisons' and 'optimizing to avoid organizing' is useful to identify 'sequences of alternative next intents' that can be solved for first
        - example of an algorithm to identify 'specific structures matching an abstract interface variable' like 'interactions' (from abstract to the more useful specific variant, stopping specification once it interacts with existing functions like regex)
            - abstract variable (interaction) -> specific variables from its definition (input/output, function call stacks) -> 'defined/understood or emergent/observed' patterns identifying those specific variables (def/return keywords, function call operators) -> specific implementation (fuzzy regex of patterns of those specific variables)
                - abstract variable -> specific definition variants -> specific 'defined/understood or emergent/observed' identifiers of specific definition variants -> specific identification tools with enough variation potential (like 'regex with fuzzy matching or semgrep or context matching') to identify those specific identifiers
            - reversing this to 'identify what concepts like/beyond "interactivity" can be identified from existing/imminent functions' is useful as a general problem-solving intent, as referenced elsewhere
            - this identifies the 'limits/extensions of a spectrum (like abstract/specific)' as variable rather than fixed (there is always another specification/abstraction to 'extend or more completely fill' a spectrum)
            - similarly, identifying 'how graphs can be incorrect' (how graphs can be limited/extended/variable/incomplete/over-prioritized/over-defined as opposed to opposites of these variables) is useful to 'optimize graph generation/filtering'
        - relatedly, identifying 'emergent meaning' involves identifying 'interactions' (like 'meaning, n count of interactions away') and 'relevant interactions' ('meaning, through interactions with interface structures like similarities/limits/problems') by applying some similarity (extrapolating interactions to the same 'n count of interactions', or identifying similarities like 'intersections' with a problem), where this similarity is expected to generate/identify some useful difference ('n steps away' or 'intersection with an interface structure' is likely to be enough to generate 'useful differences in meaning/interactions that solve a problem'), and identifying the connections between 'these similarities' and the 'useful differences they generate', and the connections between the 'useful differences they generate' and the 'differences required to solve a problem' are useful to identify

    - identifying useful structures like 'vertex/interface interactions that generate useful sequences (like difference-connecting spectrums of a graph sequence)'
        - for example, its useful to identify 'possible/probable solution/error configurations and possible/probable defined/emergent similarities on a abstract/specific graph' and filter that by 'possible/probable relevant problem type' (identify 'possible solution/error configurations on a graph, given a problem type') which applies vertexes like 'abstract/specific' and 'probable/possible' (required/defined vs. emergent) and interfaces like 'similar/usage/emergent (meaning)' on a sequence (that can be a 'spectrum of difference/similarity') that connects the differences of a problem using these graphs as filters to connect the problem differences (like 'graphs with possible solution/error positions'), as indicated in 'problem_solution_graph_query_configurations.drawio.svg'
        - relatedly, identifying 'all the items in a set (in order to identify whether some structure is an item in that set)' is an alternative way to solve the problem of 'identifying whether some structure has a variable/property' (like whether some pattern continues infinitely by identifying 'the limits/areas or the set of all infinite structures', similar to how identifying the 'generative/component/descriptive/input variables' of infinite structures is an alternative way to identify an infinite structure)
            - relatedly, identifying the 'most relevant (such as the most computable) definition variant' of a concept is useful for identifying 'alternative connections to prove' than the original connection (identifying the most computable variant of 'infinite/absolute/general'), where 'most computable' can mean 'most interactive with identified structures'

    - identifying useful structures like 'coordinating similarities/differences that make other similarities/differences obvious, which can be combined in the same function' as a function type that acts like an 'interim filter'
        - for example, identifying a 'function that is obviously similar/different to other functions (or function types)' is useful as an 'interim filter' which will either be clearly correct/incorrect when applied as a solution (such as a molecule that resembles various pathogens, groups of genes, antioxidants, etc that 'reflects some variable/interaction of a bio-system when absorbed/processed')
        - this is similar to how 'maximally different' functions are useful as pre-filtered base solutions, but involves applying coordinating differences that will be obviously correct/incorrect bc of their similarity/difference to other functions
        - this applies a solution as a filter (similar to how 'change a base solution' applies a solution as a filter), and similar to how problems like 'unit problems' can be applied as a filter, indicating that workflows can be generated by applying interface structures as core workflow functions
        - relatedly, variables of risk ('high cost' variables like 'bravery') are useful in algorithms (where there are costs associated with identifying solutions there), similar to how 'curiosity' is useful as a 'high-cost, low-reward' variable that can pay off in situations where iterations are required

    - identifying useful structures like 'implementation/iteration/application/optimization structures that havent been integrated optimally yet' and example specific structures like 'integration degrees/starting points' that can usefully direct the intent of automatic generation of implementation applications of a solution to a general complex problem that would require these 'implementation networks' to be optimized (for example to the reality-simulation/derivation/description or reality-optimization problem)
        - for example, since its easy to get distracted with details of manually identifying/designing/building specific implementations and all the problems of each implementation (implementations like 'apply abstractions of real systems until one abstract network is identified' or 'apply first principles until real systems are generated'), its useful to automate that process of 'identifying/integrating implementation-generating networks', and avoid that problem completely of over-investing in one implementation strategy, by avoiding designing/training these implementation strategies and implementation applications manually one at a time, and instead train an 'implementation-generation network for a problem' and have that 'implementation-generation network' suggest 'optimal implementations' that another 'implementation application generative network' will apply when implementing a 'generative abstract causal' reality-simulation network (and other interface variants of this reality-simulation network that are useful), after which an 'implementation optimization network' will optimize the 'implementation application' (a 'specific implementation network model') generated by the generative network, and then 'iterate optimizing/merging of optimal implementation applications', which will give feedback to the 'implementation-generation network' on what it should avoid or try in future implementations
            - 'implementation generative network', for a problem like 'simulate reality' or 'connect all graphs/errors/variables' or 'predict all graphs/errors/variables'
                - 'implementation application generative network', for an implementation
                    - 'implementation optimization network', for an implementation application
                        - 'implementation application merging network', for a set of implementation applications
            - there are other useful options like 'implementation application optimization merging network', etc from applying iterations to these structures, as well as 'generative/merging sequences' that can be applied in a useful way in this 'network of networks', and 'integrating feedback across/between these networks in a non-sequential way', as well as 'usage filtering/routing networks to identify when to invest in/use a result of these networks (when to use an implementation or an optimization or an implementation application, and what network to send it to)'
            - the manual work (other than identifying these variables and feeding them into a 'generative/filter network') can involve 'identifying optimal metrics/variants of these iteration structures output by a network' (iteration structures like 'variables/degrees/starting points/networks' of iterations), a network that integrates these networks with sequences of core functions like 'generate/filter/merge' that are useful to apply in connecting implementation/application/optimization networks, where the optimal network of this 'network of networks' applies the 'degree of iteration that is likely to be useful to automatically identify' (like the degree that human feedback can usefully evaluate/modify), while other changing/generating/filtering/limiting networks like an 'iteration network to generate additional iteration optimizations' try to out-perform or optimize the currently useful iteration in the background (such as by 'adding additional iterations or other iteration structures')
            - this applies 'completely analyzing (thinking it through) until relevant interactions are identified' to 'iterated networks' like 'networks of networks', since there are 'optimal interactions yet to be identified' like 'limits of network optimization (intersections of network iterations and limits on an optimized metric, at the cost of not optimizing other metrics)'
            - once these networks like a 'highly optimized reality-simulating network' are identified, optimal networks of optimal usages of the network can be identified, such as to query for imminent problems to solve like 'new deadly plants that are evolving' and query for optimizations to 'queries for imminent problems to solve' to organize/optimize these queries, as a 'usage/query network' is a useful network to add to an identified optimized network (as are other interface networks of a network to act as a limiting/evaluating/iterative force to solve emerging errors in the 'next layer of network iterations' once a network is identified as optimal and starts to be used), which identifies 'rules of solution usage networks' as useful to identify/optimize
            - solving the problem of identifying these interface network interactions (like 'iterations/connections') first (as opposed to identifying the inputs to this network like core components/implementations/optimizations first) is a way to filter 'optimal specifications like "core structures" to apply in "core networks"' by understanding what should be iterated/optimized first and then identifying structures useful to implement those intents
        - relatedly, identifying cross-interface (like 'cross-simplicity/abstraction/usage') connections between specific simple networks (like 'connection (proof) structure networks' and 'network structure networks' and 'function structure networks' and 'requirement structure networks' and 'intent structure networks') and generally useful complex networks (like 'workflow networks' and 'optimization/iteration/implementation/organization networks' and 'iterations/integrations/optimizations of these networks') is a generally useful problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying 'networks/sequences of network intents' is useful like identifying how its useful to identify specific useful 'variants/connections of these identified network types' before identifying useful 'additional iterations of these network types', unless an 'iteration optimization network' is already identified
        - relatedly, identifying 'independent (extremely different) similarities of the defined similarities of a graph' as being optimal differences to identify (by being cross-interface differences) are useful to optimize for in graph generation (as in 'identify complexity variables by an abstraction graph' or iteratively, 'identify complexity graph variables of a graph of abstraction graphs') to identify 'possible errors like "limits" of possible independence-reduction' by identifying which independent structures cant be adjacently connected in any graph
        - relatedly, 'connections like sequences that apply multi-layer relevance networks' like "the function that is 'best at thinking' is 'correct about statements in general', including 'correct about statements specifically about thinking', including 'statements about whether it is the best at thinking'" are a useful basis for 'graphs having multiple similarities' like 'self-reference structures which can create cycles' as well as 'logical structural similarities like each statement having a similar term as the previous statement' (where 'logical similarities (across interfaces like structure)' and 'intent similarities' and other interface similarities are useful to identify as 'similarities to connect in a network for use in filtering interface queries based on similarities' as well as 'maximally different cross-interface structure networks (like connecting logical similarites and intent variables and structure patterns)')
        - relatedly, other ways to apply variables to a graph (as a hidden graph layer) include 'optimizing a graph for an intent', which identifies 'other emergent similarities to identify in a graph' ('how useful/similar is this graph for/to this intent')

    - identifying useful structures like 'variants of a filtered set of "all but one solutions"' as a way of determining solutions by 'reducing required comparisons to interface equivalences like range/count equivalences'
        - whether proving 'all other equivalences of some type are correct (like whether the specifications of a connection are true and the extreme variants of a connection are true)' determines whether the 'original equivalence of that type is correct', depending on the position of the original equivalence or the 'connection between these alternate connections' (are there examples of a connection with cross-interface metrics like 'count ratio/variant truth' where 'all interface variants (like variants within a type) of the connection are true except one variant', etc)
        - relatedly, identifying the 'graph of ratios/positions/areas of connections' between semi-relevant overlapping concepts like 'directly/exactly' (connections that are 'direct but not exact, exact but not direct, exact and direct, or neither exact or direct') is useful when applying queries that have specific connection requirements (for example, an 'exact and direct solution' is often not required for most problems)
        - identifying whether it is 'less/more true' than the 'previous/next truth in a sequence', as in 'are these sequences alternating beyond large sub-infinite values' for the problem of 'do these sequences alternate infinity' (rather than proving it for infinity, identify that its more than the next type of number lower than infinity, bc there is a 'type spectrum/sequence' that could exist which could be used for proving variables of interactions with adjacent/otherwise relevant types on that sequence, indicating that it 'crosses the boundary of the "infinite" variable between these hypothetical sub-infinite and infinite types'), where identifying that a 'type spectrum' exists allows application of 'comparisons' (like less/more) in a proof, rather than the exact original connection, as there is likely a 'pattern/similarity (like a threshold/ratio) on this spectrum' where the solution variable exists/is true/begins, which is similar to filtering out 'all but one item in a set' and instead filters out a 'range of items (lower than the solution) by identifying that the next item down is insufficient for the solution variable to exist', reducing the problem to be 'guaranteed to be solved' by identifying equivalences
            - this involves how 'filtering all but one solutions in a set' has a 'count equivalence' with the assumption that there is 'at least one solution in the set', and 'identifying that the next lowest type is insufficient' has a 'range equivalence' with 'the solution is in the range higher than the next lowest type', where these equivalences can be used to generate workflows that reduce a problem to a reduced number of comparisons (like n-1 comparisons as in 'only make sure the number of solutions remaining after filtering is equal to the number of solutions required' as opposed to 'checking every solution', or a more trivial comparison as in 'only check that its greater than the easier to compute comparison, such as being greater than the next lowest value beneath the threshold' as opposed to 'check that its greater than the difficult to compute threshold')
            - similarly, identifying 'connections between truth structures like truth similarities like truth areas (ranges/limits/spectrums)' (and specifications like 'truth similarity/difference areas (areas of truth variants)') are a useful specific alternative to identifying general 'truth patterns'
            - relatedly, identifying 'useful graphs embedded in already identified graphs' is useful, like identifying 'truth spectrums' on a 'similarity index' to fulfill generally useful intents like 'identify similarities that are more useful in identifying truths', to filter interface queries by 'filtering which similarities to apply'
        - similar to 'identifying a lower/upper range truth' by 'identifying position on a possibility spectrum' or 'identifying whether "all/at least one/none" variants of a connection are true' and similar to 'identifying connections between requirements/dependencies rather than the original connection', 'identifying surrounding connections' (identifying all the true connections in a system except the original connection, to identify the truth of the original connection) is another example of applying interface structures to identify relevant connections to a 'connection to be proved' (if all surrounding connections are true, how does that impact the original connection, meaning 'when do impossible/false connections occur in isolation in areas of possible/true connections') and 'identifying the possibility of connecting "systems where the original connection is true" and "real systems"' (connect to a system where the original connection is true, then connect that system to a real system, as opposed to connecting the original connection in a real system)
            - relatedly, identifying structures that 'intersect' with a connection at 'count ratios' like 'intersection at only one point' or 'relevance ratios' like 'intersection at a relevant point like a limit/maximum' and 'ways these intersecting structures can be irrelevant/relevant' (ways that an intersecting perpendicular line can be irrelevant to a regression line, like whether it intersects with an outlier or an average or another type of point) and 'ways that independent intersections can be irrelevant/relevant to each other (a network of these independent intersections creating relevance, such as intersecting with the slope of the solution function)' as a way of proving a connection with intersections (creating proof of a connection with only a set of "mostly independent intersections (independent as in, intersecting at only one point)", for example)
            - relatedly, identifying the 'possible/probable ratios of irrelevance types (such as non-determining or trivially determining or random) points to total points' in a data set is useful 
            - relatedly, identifying indirect connections like the connection between 'slope of the solution area' and 'slope of the solution function' are useful as possible useful structures to connect, given 'cases where these metrics can be relevant', even though the slope of an area is a 'frequently irrelevant structure' to the 'slope of the solution' as its a 'simple equivalence that isnt required to be correct', where finding other 'frequently irrelevant connections' (to cover the other set of cases) is a useful set to identify
            - similarly to 'ranges/thresholds', applying 'opposites' has useful variants for proving connections as well, like "identifying an 'obviously true/false variant of the original connection' to move towards/away from" is useful to apply 'opposing bases', and another way to use opposites (other than 'is the opposite of the original connection true/false') is checking whether the 'opposites of the objects in the connection are true (checking whether opposite of a = opposite of b rather than checking whether a = b)' where the 'connection between opposites' is more testable (which is related to the intent of 'identifying variants that are more testable by interactivity with proven/defined/obvious connections'), which requires a 'graph determining relevant opposites (opposites that are relevant to the similarity/connection to be proved)'
        - this involves identifying different 'bases/standards' to 'differentiate from and/or similarize to' (identifying a 'false/true (error/solution) base set', a 'more/less true base set', a 'truth limit base set', a 'spectrum extreme base set', an 'opposite base set', an 'adjacent similar base set', a 'count/ratio/range/average base set', an 'independent intersection base set', a 'similarity/difference base set', a 'certainty/uncertainty base set', an 'interactive base set (as in, does it interact with these interface structures)', an 'irrelevant/relevant base set', a 'requirement base set', and other 'interface base sets')
        - relatedly, its useful to identify other connections (relevant to the original theorized unproven connection) which are also true, to determine possible invalidations that could make the original connection false (if a particle exists in two places at once, what else is equivalent - are those positions in space-time equivalent in some other way? did the required measurements of the two points become equal or equal to the measurement threshold? does perspective fragment somehow to make their equivalence seem true but only from a subset of positions/angles? is one only a reflection of the other in some way?)

    - identifying useful structures like 'coordinating relevance that is possible to describe on the same graph (as non-invalidating graph layers)' as a way of identifying 'graphs that indicate all useful ratios/similarities'
        - identifying 'coordinating/complementary relevance that is possible to describe on the same graph' is useful (such as a graph where 'angles between concepts' indicate similarity and vertex bases indicate similar concepts to both concepts connected by that angle)
        - relatedly, identifying queries of "interface similarities which would be useful if they were true/connectible, and which are defined/likely to have 'true variants/subsets'" such as 'if this type interaction alternates, will its requirements/limits/etc also alternate' involves 'identifying interface similarities (of a specific connection to prove)' which are useful to identify as 'alternate connections to prove which prove another connection' (prove that the 'requirements alternate infinitely', rather than the sequences)
            - relatedly, answering the question of whether an 'alternating type sequence set is absolute' can be approximated with relevant interactions of a sequence with determining variables like 'sums/averages' (if its absolute/infinite, it will have this sum, and the sums of the sequences will have this connection, such as both being infinite and both being different from some other sequence sum)
        - relatedly, answering the question of whether an 'alternating type sequence set is absolute' can be approximated by substituting with 'relevantly equivalent' structures like subsets (like how 'solving a question for positive integers' can 'solve some questions about all integers' when the positive integers are a 'relevant equivalence' of another set for a particular equivalence test, where 'relevant equivalences' can often be identified), which involves changing a 'connection until its provable by interacting with already proven/defined structures'
        - relatedly, the 'possibility/requirement spectrum' is useful for identifying questions like 'are there any possible/confirmed examples of that connection type' and 'do these structures always have that connection type' or 'is it required for these structures to have that connection type' which can be useful to identify a 'upper/lower possibility range' of these questions which are relevant for a specific problem, and similarly 'maximal differences are useful to identify areas of optimality, or optimal directions, or directions of limits/averages' ('what maximally different connections are true in this specific way with the connection to be proven'), and similarly 'averages across spectrums (like complexity/abstraction) that are usually true/possible/relevant are useful to apply as a base solution' ('what is the average complexity and abstraction for a true/possible/relevant connection')
        - relatedly, identifying 'iterations of relevance' like 'relevant relevance' for a problem is useful bc not all relevance structures are required to solve every problem
            - relatedly, working backwards from relevance structures is another way to solve a problem like 'what relevant (such as general) variable types are usually connectible' and finding a connection between those relevant variable types and every problem

    - identifying useful structures like 'opposites (like unique/specific connections) of useful structures (like abstraction/types)' that can be used to filter the same structures to enable applying rules like 'filter reduced sets until inevitable alternatives exist' ('filter sets into a reduced set of alternatives so that identifying that one type doesnt apply identifies that the other type inevitably/uniquely applies or is required to apply')
        - for example, other structures than 'limits/abstractions/similarities/requirements/definitions' are usable to derive all connections, such as how 'unique connections' are rare so they can be used to filter other connections as theyre a reduced subset which identifies the other subset (once 'all the unique connections' are identified, everything else can be used to generate/connect to everything else), where 'unique adjacent connections' (such as 'only the unique value pi is so adjacently connectible to a general circle, as opposed to a specific circle which might be similarly adjacent to values like its radius and the number of degrees to rotate it') are more common than 'absolutely unique connections' (having all the universal constants, or all the abstract connections, or all the unique adjacent connections, are similar alternatives that can identify all other info types/connections)
        - these connection types like 'uniqueness (as opposed to abstract connections)' are useful bc they can be derived to cover an entire set of possibilities (identifying 'inputs to uniqueness' are possible, and 'inputs to inputs to uniqueness', etc, to identify the 'less unique' and 'opposite of unique' connection patterns/areas/structures as 'more distant inputs to uniqueness'), which identifies 'identifying non-covering variables and their interacting relevance areas to create coverage in combination with other non-covering variables' as an unsolved problem that is useful to apply when abstract interface variables are distantly derivable for a problem type
        - relatedly, abstract connections between useful structures like 'graphs' (as in 'generative variables, distant emergent similarities, definitions') are useful to identify useful 'generative variables/distant emergent similarities/defined similarities' of 'graphs of graphs' and other useful abstract connection variables of iterations of those connections (identifying questions like 'given what is defined to be similar, what alternatives could emerge as similar' as a useful application of 'reduced subsets to identify other remainder subsets' given the reduced set of alternatives as an item can only either be a 'defined or emergent similarity/difference' and the defined set of similarities/differences in a graph is a reduced subset as in 'smaller than the other, as in more useful at identifying the other subset than the other subset')

    - identifying useful structures like 'reference point graphs' which havent yet been connected with interface structures, which are useful for applying workflows like 'filter a range of solutions (a range of reference point graphs)' to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'identify optimal solution graphs'
        - identifying the 'graph of reference point graphs' like a graph that is an 'upper/lower/average base of another graph' or other interface reference points, specifically involving solutions like the 'graph of graphs of all solutions', which is related to how there are 'ranges/limits of optimal solutions and absolute best-case solutions and other reference points of solutions', which can be applied to other useful structures like 'graphs of solutions', involving reference points which apply interface structures or their intersections
        - relatedly, identifying how surprisingly useful graphs like a abstraction graph with specifications around abstractions, where the specifications have a 'similarity like a pattern involve identifying possible useful pattern structures' and checking for variation possible in that graph that can create those patterns, thereby connecting the 'abstract-specific graph' with 'graphs of useful/surprising similarity/connection structures' (checking if a 'set of specifications in this abstraction graph can have a useful/surprising connection structure like right angles'), where starting from the opposite side of 'generating graphs where at least one or multiple useful/surprising similarity/connection structure like a right-angle connection exists between a set of solutions (and checking for an overlap with other graphs like an abstract-specific graph)' is an alternative
        - relatedly, 'solution grids and solution cluster graphs and spectrums of errors/solutions' are specifically useful to identify overlaps/connections between (identifying similarities between graphs of solution similarities)

    - identifying useful structures like 'solution filters to apply (like more powerful/general/relevant solutions)' to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'filter inputs to workflows' like 'filtering solutions/interfaces to apply with a workflow'
        - for example, identifying filters of the best structures to apply with a particular workflow like 'change a base solution' which can be optimized by applying the most powerful/relevant/optimal solutions as the base (such as solving biological problems using 'bacteria' first as a more powerful structure that can 'change immunity/change inflammation/add functionality by generating proteins/etc', and solving chemistry problems like 'climate change' with 'lasers' as a more powerful structure to apply first whenever possible, which can 'change electricity/radiation/chemical identities with relatively few inputs')
        - identifying resource distribution optimizations like 'fairness/justice optimizations' by 'selling debt so its held by those "most in need of the resources of debtors" to increase the value of those resources so fewer resources are needed to pay the debt, pooling resources (and incentivizing interactivity/differences to create resources) to apply those changes of debt ownership' and by "increasing interactivity/differences in lenders' groups to increase economic resources/growth/transfers so borrowers dont need to repay them" and by 'increasing discoveries of resources that can change the value of other resources like useful new "battery/chip materials/methods" to change resource/value distribution' and by 'applying artificial demand/resource distribution by applying artificial rules to exclude criminal lenders to decrease the value of their resources/money' and 'applying indirect methods like changing base interest rates to increase borrowing/lending in different markets', and 'organizing debt to be held by criminals who should be optimizing their work to incentivize optimizations'
        - relatedly, 'forced relevance' is useful to identify as a form of 'false relevance' which can be created artificially by 'forcing relevance (such as by creating artificial demand/dependence to force relevance)'
        - relatedly, identifying whether some sequence has some subset on one 'subset similarity graph' and another subset on another 'subset similarity graph' (or has an interaction/intersection similarity like an 'intersection with relevant numbers that can determine sequence variables like sums/averages') is an alternative to 'identifying conceptual variable similarities' as a way of 'identifying the sequence or its variables'
            - this is related to how representing a series as a sum 'loses most of the info of the series' so the sum isnt a 'generally good representation', except where there are "similarities in interface variables like 'probabilities' in sums" like how sums of 'alternating sign sequences' can be zero, which reflects the relevant info of the 'alternation' variable of the sequence (the probability of the sequence having alternating signs, given that its sum is zero, is a higher probability given that its a more useful way to generate a zero sum than some other ways, without a requirement, given the 'alternate routes to zero', which identifies a 'useful identifying test' to rule out a sequence type like a 'zero-sum alternating sequence' as improbable by testing 'adjacent subset sums')
            - identifying connections between structures (structures of sequences like 'alternations') and related relevance structures like 'equivalences' ('alternations' can create equivalences) is similarly useful in 'identifying equivalences/similarities/differences (like sequence similarities, like sequences with similar reasons like alternation for a specific sum like zero) across structures (like sequences)'
            - this can be made more useful in identifying a sequence or its variables, when combined with 'representative comparisons' (like having 'this average on this subset' and 'this average on another subset') as a way to avoid computing every value of the sequence or 'identifying patterns/concepts/other similarities in a sequence'
            - identifying a 'subset of reduced size that identifies all other sets' (like how a reduced set can identify another, like where there is a high ratio of one set size compared to another, where these sets are the only possible sets so if an item isnt in one, its definitely in the other set, such as how a complete set of problem-solving/solution structures can identify the larger set of all errors, and how identifying optimal solutions can identify the larger set of suboptimal solutions, and so on) is theoretically possible and useful as a general intent to 'filter problem-solving processes', where this 'sequence of reduced sets to identify' is a useful sequence across problems to filter interface queries ('solving for a variable of a later item in the sequence' is more useful)
        - relatedly, generally its useful to make solving a problem trivial by 'identifying adjacent structures (solution descriptions/metrics/components/other solutions that can be varied or combined to create solutions, solution ranges, possible solution sets, function networks that can create solutions when queried in the right sequence, etc) to the solution' (at which point identifying the solution from those structures is trivial with one process of combination/filter/iteration), which are useful to connect (connect adjacent structures of solutions) and connect to non-adjacent structures of solutions (structures that can be combined non-trivially to create solutions), which is possible to optimize by applying 'relevance' structures (what is adjacent to 'all' solutions, 'all' making this query generally relevant to every structure), which involves combining different types of relevance structures ('trivially' relevant and 'generally' relevant)
        - relatedly, 'signals of specific changes like "big change requirements"' are useful to identify, like an 'all-interface change' such as 'deviations between measurements and predictions from a network of understood connections' which indicates a change may be required across multiple interfaces

    - identifying useful structures like 'sequences of requirement invalidation' that are useful to identify where structures like 'variables' with those requirements have 'limits on relevance'
        - where 'variables break down' like where their 'requirements are invalidated in a sequence' is useful to identify, such as how its useful to identify structures where 'relevance breaks down' such as where 'everything is equivalent or approximately equivalent or adjacently connectible', so identifying 'areas/patterns of equivalence (like connections that alternate in a way that covers the range of an entire iteration)' is useful to identify 'areas/patterns of irrelevance' ('numbers that fit the pattern are irrelevant by being clearly and completely defined/identified')
        - identifying the concept of an 'integer' is useful while iterating fractions (while iterating fractions between integers like from 0 to 1, it might seem impossible that anything but a fraction could exist bc there are infinite fractions possible in the right sequence with increasingly small units between two adjacent integers within reasonable distance from a limit of 0, but integers arent called fractions even though they can be defined that way, so its useful to identify the concept of a 'fraction that can be represented as only its numerator' as something relevant to look for, or useful to determine ways to skip ahead to such a number in this iteration, since integers are useful for differentiating other number types, which can be used to differentiate 'types of fractions like irrational numbers')
        - relatedly, 'proving a connection is true (as opposed to its opposite)' can be done by identifying the concepts to identify connections/positions of, where some concept represents the true variant (like whether some sequences 'alternate' absolutely) and another concept represents its opposite (as in the falsifying variant, like whether those sequences 'overlap' at some point) so resolving the connection/position of these concepts (identifying all the abstract ways that concepts like 'alternating' and 'overlapping' and concepts like 'alternation' and 'separation by additional sequences' can be connected and checking for those abstract connections or their specifications/inputs, where 'separation by additional sequences' and 'overlaps' are opposing errors to differentiate from to identify that their interim 'alternation' is maintained absolutely) can resolve which connection variant is true
            - similarly, identifying whether some falsifying variant of a relevant structure exists (like where info stops being relevant, such as a point in a sequence where factors stop being relevant) and whether this 'irrelevance can combine with other relevant variables to create invalidations' is useful (like how integers make the fraction format less relevant to their definition)
            - relatedly, identifying component variants of a connection (identifying 'whether the integer sequence continues absolutely') is possible to pair with other variants like where 'all integers have a requirement to be one of the sequences in the set of even/odd sequences' (which rules out some possible invalidation structures like where 'some variable increases during an iteration of the sequence' which can change the required solution variable as in the 'alternation' of the sequences by 'adding another possible sequence to the set') which are adjacent to the connection to prove, which doesnt rule out 'all possible invalidations' but rules out a 'high ratio of invalidations'
        - relatedly, 'relevant' doesnt equal 'similar' bc there are 'irrelevant similarities (like low ratios of similarities or required/defined similarities or trivial similarities that can be irrelevant in different contexts)' and 'similarities rarely complete a problem-solving process independently (without other structures like specifications/limits/combinations/queries of similarities)', where more interactive similarities like 'abstract similarities' are more relevant and likelier to completely solve a problem
        - relatedly, identifying 'what a graph is incorrect about' (like what it over-simplifies or excludes, like over-simplifying 'general similarity' to 'usage/structural/input/interaction similarity' or like how a 'network of concepts' excludes 'networks of concept combinations') is useful to predict useful graphs for an intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between cross-interface structures like "probabilities of connection filters" by connecting "equivalences/requirements" of related structures like "concepts" in useful graphs (like concept graphs)'
        - identifying the improbability of rules like 'every concept of similar complexity has to be used the same number of times to generate other concepts' given the improbability of an equivalence in possible useful usages to completeness, so inferring connections like 'if a number isnt as relevant as another, that means the concepts to identify its relevance are missing, so other interface variables need to be used equally completely to generate alternate concepts' is not possible to connect logically as there is no requirement for the usage count or usage complexity of a concept to be equivalent to the usage count of another concept, as the concept definitions change the usage count and usage complexity and other usage metrics
        - this identifies a 'probability' of a useful 'connection filters' by identifying an 'equivalence that isnt required' between 'interface graphs of concepts' (like the 'usage graph of a concept in identifying relevant structures like useful numbers'), which I thought about when identifying what rules/assumptions of other workflows could be incorrect, like the assumption that some numbers are more useful than others (which could be incorrect bc the concepts required to identify a number as useful might not have been identified yet, which made me think of a default way to check that like applying other concepts instead of those related to identified useful numbers, which made me realize that assumes an equivalence in 'how much a concept needs to be used, compared to other concept usage' to generate the full set of relevant numbers, where this equivalence is not guaranteed/required bc concepts have different interactivity and there is no other structure requiring such an equivalence)
            - relatedly, identifying the 'ratios of concept usage counts' is useful to identify, such as how more abstract variables like 'equivalence/difference and generality/complexity' should be used more frequently in identifying relevant structures like the 'full set of the most useful numbers' than other more specific variables like 'volatility'), and the same applies to iterated structures of structures like 'concept connection usage counts', etc
            - this is similar to how there are a 'set of concepts that trivially identify some subset of all useful numbers' and identifying required equivalences like whether this set of concepts is required to be the same as the 'concepts that trivially generate other subsets of useful numbers' is useful (since there may be connections that cant be abstracted with a simple unifying abstract concept as in 'interim connections between all other abstract connections (like ambiguities not differentiable into random/simple/etc connections)', meaning there may not definitely be or may not have a requirement to be a way to connect everything trivially with some abstraction that covers 'any possible iteration connecting some distant structures', a there is always a way to connect some set of abstract concepts to some number, since abstract concepts are relevant to everything, but whether there is 'always a way to trivially connect any set of abstract concepts with any number' meaning there is 'always some abstract similarity connecting any concept set with any number' is not determined to be true), and similarly this is also related to how there can be 'sets of concepts that trivially generate a higher ratio of the set of all useful numbers' (this is a relevant possibility, as in it isnt required to be false)
        - relatedly, identifying 'graph sequences to get to a graph where a ratio is useful/possible to identify (like a ratio separating types)' is useful since optimal graphs have simple connections/differences between relevant differences like 'types like solution/error' or 'relevant vs. irrelevant information' but a 'simple structure like a spectrum with a defining separation (like a ratio)' is not always adjacent with identified graphs or possible to identify without defined (using only independent) connections, so identifying 'probable graph sequences (like simplifying graph sequences) to connect to a useful graph' is a useful intent, which I thought about when thinking about a 'signal to noise ratio' (a ratio of irrelevant/relevant data, which is not always a useful structure as it only involves a 'count of relevant info structures' but which is still a useful graph to aim for in many problems like to direct focus of work such as to identify 'a count of data points to filter out' though it may be more useful to have structures like 'average relevance of variables' to focus work such as to 'identify difference from average relevance of variables', where structures have to be highly organized and understood in order to identify the separating threshold between irrelevant/relevant data, so this graph may not be useful/possible until many other structures relevant to relevance are understood, so this graph sequence can involve simplifying structures like 'concepts adjacent to relevance')
            - similarly, identifying graph sequences to move on a spectrum like 'possibility' (a graph sequence to move from possibility to probability for example) is useful to identify as 'graph sequences that can connect maximal differences in a similarity like a spectrum'
            - relatedly, identifying the 'approximate relevant/irrelevant info ratio' is useful as a way to identify the 'least useful relevance metric' ('count of relevant info bits, count of irrelevant info bits', a metric that is 'non-trivial to identify' and 'comparatively useless, compared to other metrics once identified'), where other ratios would identify more useful metrics
        - relatedly, identifying metrics like the 'count of exact equivalences (vs. approximate equivalences) which are possible in a set' is useful to identify as a set of 'absolute possibility metrics' which simplify some problem like 'identifying exact vs. approximate equivalences' by identifying that a 'count of an equivalence of some type (like exact)' is possible to identify as the 'absolute reference point' in a set of definitions (there are only so many exact equivalences possible in a set and identifying these is useful as a reduced set to identify what equivalences are approximate)
            - relatedly, identifying variants of rules like 'test all the other possibilities except one so the last one doesnt need to be computed, in a case where the absolute ratio of types is already identified' such as 'identifying a smaller set when only two sets/types are possible (like exact/approximate equivalences), so that the larger set is identified by identifying the smaller set'

    - identifying useful structures like 'similarities/differences from errors (like different combinations of error types) that can create errors' to fulfill general problem-solving intents like 'apply errors as reference points to identify solutions'
        - for example, applying 'equal perspectives/solutions' and 'two groups of equivalent solutions' both invalidate intents like 'compute the average of the full set', which is derivable by applying simple queries regarding interface variables like 'what should be equal/different in this averaging system (involving an average of errors intended to create a solution)' which is only relevant in cases like 'where the errors are overprioritization errors' (averaging errors of the same type is more valid than averaging errors across types, and only two errors of the same type are required to determine the position of the average if its known that theyre equal in type)
        - similarly, 'similarly incorrect errors' identify a possible solution at their midpoint/average if the 'errors are incorrect to the same degree, but have very different (opposite) positions', except where the midpoint is a more extreme error (hence the difference from other errors) rather than a solution, so applying similarities/differences to errors to 'maintain some similarity and create some difference' can identify other useful errors, like identifying errors that are 'similarly different from some other reference point' (like an 'absolute limit'), as opposed to identifying errors that are 'similarly different from some solution' (which is not known yet), which involves identifying 'what is derivable from different sets of errors (like different types of errors, different positions of errors, etc)'
        - relatedly, there are reasons why other variables are necessary to expand dimensions until alternatives are possible, even though the 'optimal range of simplicity' to identify most solutions to most problems in is already identifiable, this range doesnt describe 'all solution structures' until other variables are integrated to identify all abstract/otherwise relevant 'simplicity/complexity structures'
        - relatedly, functions that can generate patterns like 'waves' are useful to identify 'absolute limits on a function that describes graphs' such as a 'variable set where one variable changes the other' or where a 'range is the limiting factor' or where a 'limiting/increasing variable set are interactive, with different and alternating timing'
        - similarly, idemtifying 'trajectories away from/toward a one-solution graph is useful' (like 'applying functions to convert a function into having one minimum'), just like other interface solution graphs like 'one "solution cluster" graph' and so on are useful to identify changing/connective variables of these graphs, as well as identifying functions to change systems into producing more optimal graphs like where there are 'regular alternative solutions' like in a wave
            - relatedly, given that there will be a description generatable with interface variables that describes at least one solution to a problem (like a 'one-variable solution' being a 'simplicity' description of a solution) bc there will always be 'one comparison that on its own can solve a problem' (although it might not always be trivial to reach that comparison), these interface variable solution descriptions can be used to connect problem-solving structures (like 'connecting a graph with a workflow or error definition' which add enough detail in combination to make those interface variable descriptions relevant to a problem, like where a 'one variable solution' is more relevant with a 'network of interface variables' to create a one-variable solution with)
        - relatedly, independence variants of interface variables like 'maximally unexpected (as in indirect, independent) volatility' are useful to identify as the 'best possible solutions to prioritize filtering out first' ('identify volatility when its the most difficult to identify that it can possibly be', such as by creating volatility by "applying non-opposing functions of volatility's opposite" or otherwise creating volatility by 'applying concepts not referenced by its definition or by definitions of related concepts') and the 'most indirect/distant/irrelevant connections that are still the same structure' (so that a 'maximal independence query can be identified to find 'maximal independence solutions/errors using only maximal independence connections/components', which is useful for identifying an upper limit on related concepts like 'complexity/independence' (as in 'identify the maximum independence that can occur in this variable like volatility with this set of problem-solving structures like graphs' to provide a reference point to identify 'averages and probable solution ranges' of volatility as well as the 'maximum that volatility can occur and therefore the maximum that volatility can impact a structure')
            - relatedly, identifying error structures like 'ranges of error variables like volatility' in problem-solving structures like 'comparison volatility', 'graph volatility', 'query volatility' are useful to identify, such as 'volatility as an error (volatility of structures that would ideally be stable like solution types/patterns/similarities) across solution/error graphs' ('volatility' being an error that identifies 'some connection that is not understood simply yet' so its a useful error variable to prioritize)
            - relatedly, identifying graphs of 'structures with the most errors' and working backwards from those to 'apply reference points to identify solutions' (identify structures farthest away as in 'closest to optimization limits' or in between errors)
            - relatedly, identifying solutions by applying identified solution metrics (like optimality, or generality) is mostly solved/defined, where identifying solutions by applying neutral/irrelevant metrics (like neutrality), where problems can be solved by 'generally decreasing/increasing relevance of the problem/solution' (applying general solution/error variables to the solution/problem, isolating the problem. applying error structures like 'barriers' to the problem, etc)

    - identifying useful structures like intra-variable (self) interactions that can be applied as causal sequences (crossing a simplicity structure like an 'adjacency threshold' will make relevant intents more simple as in 'trivial', which is a simplicity interaction)
        - for example, applying some functions make other functions trivial and other functions non-trivial in some systems/implementations, such as how 'identifying the last adjacent item in a set' makes 'identifying any remaining (non-adjacent) items non-trivial', where before there was one trivial item to identify so the intent was more trivial, or 'identifying a general descriptive variable/graph' can make 'identifying new variables' non-trivial or trivial depending on context like 'whether some adjacent solution set (of descriptive variables or graphs) has been identified' (as in whether some simplicity threshold is crossed by 'identifying a general descriptive variable/graph'), which involves 'applying similarities across interface variables like interface spectrums (like simplicity/complexity)', which is a specific variant of the problem-solving intent 'applying similarities to create connections between problems/solutions' that involves intra-variable interactions (the 'adjacency threshold' interaction with 'simplicity of relevant intents')
            - this is useful to identify a 'graph of what becomes more simple/complex as a result of a computation' to identify patterns in this graph such as 'patterns on intersections with simplicity structures'
        - relatedly identifying 'similarity structures (like spectrums) of similar functions/concepts (on that spectrum)' makes other intents trivial like 'identifying interim/average functions', and identifying 'intersections of function spectrums' is useful for identifying 'multi-functional and maximally different functions'

    - identifying useful structures like 'compounding filter sequences' and 'embeddable graph layers that are useful to apply in a sequence' which have an alignment (identify the 'graph variant' of a useful structure, given that graphs are more useful to identify/optimize where possible)
        - identifying graphs that fulfill useful intents like 'compounding filter sequences' is a useful intent to identify useful graph structures like 'graph sequences', such as how a graph of a 'complete set of types' can be applied to fulfill intents like 'classify functions' after which other optimizations can follow in a sequence, like graphing 'optimal/extreme/similar functions within a type' on that graph
        - relatedly, identifying intents regarding 'graphs of graphs' by matching them with 'adjacently inferrable insights' that havent been fulfilled yet is useful ('identifying missed adjacent/opposite connections or missed patterns' for all 'graphs' and 'graphs of graphs' and so on) by identifying graphs that can create these 'adjacently inferrable insights' for graph structures (like how the 'similarity index of graphs' is generally more useful to identify than a 'similarity index of variables')
        - relatedly, identifying graphs that implement 'variants of conceptual math' is useful, such as where a 'connection between related concepts' can be connected using 'valid similarities/connections' (like for example, where the length of the 'gender' vector can connect the 'king/queen nodes')
            - the difference between conceptual math and false variants merely called conceptual math is that conceptual math involves 'identifying similarities that make specific conceptual connections valid' (like how 'position plus vector equals a different position' can be made similar to 'king position plus gender vector shift equals queen position' which actually involves an addition operation) and 'changing a variable and assigning an addition operation to that change (changing the gender variable to its opposite value, and assigning an addition operator to that change, so that king plus gender change = queen, which doesnt actually involve an addition operation, it just generally "applies" a change rather than specifically "adding" a change)', which means 'identifying a graph where these similarities are valid', and similarly allows for operations like 'adding' concepts abstractly using abstract similarities/structures to represent concepts, implemented with a definition of meaning (interactivity with independent variables) so that the operation like 'power plus balance' doesnt just output a 'definition of a third concept' but also includes meaningful/relevant interactions with other concepts (like how 'power interacts with change', 'power interacts with powerful structures like infinities', 'power interacts with concepts associated with balance like similarity', etc, so that 'addition' is applied relevantly for these interactions, since concepts represent a complex set of interactions so adding a concept to a concept is like 'merging the definition/interaction networks of the concepts'), so that other operations like 'identify a concept which matches variation on this interface' is possible using the core operations of conceptual math
        - relatedly, an example of a disorganized graph is a 'typical language graphed by similarity of structure' having 'irrelevant adjacent connections' like 'simple structural similarities' (like letter sequences and sounds) that are 'similar across semantic differences' where occasionally an adjacency will be relevant but only coincidentally rather than intentionally (like 'simple/similarity'), and identifying a similarly disorganized graph (but an opposing graph on some variable set, to provide a limiting reference point like an upper/lower graph range) is useful to identify whether a more optimal graph is between or beyond these graphs on this variable set that differentiates them
            - relatedly, integrated/overlapping spectrums are a useful structure to identify in graphs, as occurs in the 2-d variation concept cluster graph

    - identifying useful structures like 'adjacent changes to a graph that intersect with independent variables not built-in to the graph' and 'cross-independence connections (like 'cross-graph metrics') which are useful for general intents like 'identifying graphs that can adjacently solve a problem bc of the inferrable connections of that graph'
        - the 'adjacent insight connections inferrable with a graph' are useful to identify (what does the graph miss that is adjacent to infer, or what does the graph incorrectly apply as a similarity/constant) as useful for either matching with interface queries looking for those inferrable structures or with a requirement to apply an interface query to create a new graph, given that identified graphs cant adjacently infer some required connection, where these 'adjacently inferrable insight connections' involve trivial changes of the graph that happen to be useful (like 'adding a connection/step/node') bc of what the graph doesnt include (the graph doesnt connect everything, just some known similar/different structures, but it allows for other differences to be applied which can create other connections), where these trivial changes of the graph are useful for interacting with independent variables not built-in to the graph
        - relatedly, identifying cross-independence connections is useful, like 'concepts (volatility, specificity) that when applied to structures like functions like "describe" determine/change independent functions like "usage"', which identifies the 'conceptual metric ratio' required to create independence
            - these cross-interface connections are useful to compute to identify distant connections to identify the 'maximum distance' (maximal independence) of what a variable is capable of impacting
            - an example is 'cross-graph connections' which enable variables like 'cross-graph metrics' such as 'cross-graph similarity/accuracy/independence' to be applied
        - relatedly, identifying 'graphs of optimal connections' as in 'what should be equal/different' by applying relevant concept/structure/other interface connections is useful to filter/complete a graph, like how a graph connecting 'cluster complexity' with 'cluster connection variation' and cluster connection count' is useful to complete any clusters with missing connections, where those clusters have an equivalence in complexity, so these 'optimal connection graphs' can filter interface queries involving graphs (the interface query should create that optimal graph using identified graphs)

    - identifying useful structures like 'variable relevance areas, with interface variables like specificity/problem type applied to connect variants of the variable relevance area graph' which are useful to identify for intents like 'identify areas of a solution/error' by filling in 'uncertainty spaces' with 'variable relevance structures'
        - connecting relevance areas/structures like 'irrelevant areas' (like 'default/core/unit areas' where these defaults are identified as not solving some problem, so differences are required to apply) with probably useful structures (like 'extreme similarities/differences in different interface functions like 'describe/generate' of a structure) with generally useful structure areas (like 'useful interaction areas' such as multi-functional structures) with 'cross-relevance areas' (like 'relevance interaction areas', where structures become relevant) and 'uncertainty areas' (where structures are non-determinable or not determined) and 'defined useful structures' (like 'examples/definitions of solution metrics') is a useful graph, similar to how interface variants of this graph are useful to identify, like 'specific relevance/irrelevance (to a specific problem), as opposed to general relevance'
        - relatedly, differences from error structures like 'error combinations' are useful for identifying which structures allow/create the most errors, to identify 'invaliding error combinations' which are easily verified to filter out possible useful structures with 'error combinations/sequences that frequently or are defined to co-occur'
        - relatedly, queries like 'if these structures like solutions are made similar on some graph, what becomes different on that graph (do relevant structures like errors become different on that graph)' and 'are there graphs where all relevant similar structures are similar and all relevant different structures are different' are useful for graph-filtering intents

    - identifying useful structures like 'ratio comparison sets/sequences' that can be combined in a network in a useful new way to group comparisons to increase their completeness (like a set of 'variable and system' upper/lower bounds or a set of 'comparisons across variable sets' or 'comparisons to other comparisons')
        - for example, identifying a ratio or set of ratios (comparison to a 'threshold' or a set of limits like 'an upper/lower bound') is a standard solution structure, where the set of upper/lower bounds of the problem system is more useful to identify, and comparisons to other ratios is more useful to identify (since some ratios have similar solution values bc theyve been standardized similarly or solve similar problems so they represent solving the same uncertainty in the same way, like the same 'solution position in between a set of errors', like how one 'average between concepts/errors' can reflect what another 'average between similar concepts/errors' should be similar to in terms of being different from errors or similar to solutions, since most solutions are 'in between conceptual errors like overprioritization of one concept', so there is overlap across solutions, and one solution can be used to derive another solution), which identifies 'ratio comparison sequence networks' as a useful network type between some ratios should be compared in a set/sequence/structure

    - identifying useful structures like 'relevant queries for an interface structure' to identify similarity indexes of these relevance queries to run the most common queries on the similarity index
        - identifying useful structures like 'queries of interface structures' like 'what is relevant to identify about a simple structure' is useful (with answers like 'whether it can be used for more useful intents to solve the same problems' or 'if it can be adjacently changed into its opposite', such as where the 'simplest/most accurate graph of simple/complex structures is mixed' so there are often relevant structures like 'adjacent simple/complex structures', as these maximal differences can change other relevant structures like 'successful usages of the simple structure' into its opposite like an 'error'), so identifying the structure of a simple/complex structure set (whether they can be connected adjacently or not) is the useful structure to identify, which is useful to identify 'relevant queries to apply' once a structure is identified
            - so its useful to regularly run these queries to for example, identify whether a complex structure is actually a simple structure (like a base/determining variable) of another structure and identifying these 'maximal differences connections' to identify relevant new variation/similarities
        - relatedly, the connection between 'simple/similar' occurs bc abstract similarities are simple and connect more structures
        - relatedly, 'volatility symmetries' can be useful as 'constants/variables of volatility' similar to how 'specifications (examples) of volatility' form a useful definition of it, and relatedly, how simplifications/complications of volatility are useful as 'probable upper/lower bound structures' that are useful to check for, as 'relevance structures of variables' like 'irrelevant volatility' and 'volatile similarities/symmetries' as different usages/descriptions/functions (core interface functions like use/describe/generate/have) applied as 'interaction types' of variables ('volatility') of relevant/interface structures ('similarities')
        - relatedly, a higher dimensional graph that indicates the 'network structure similarities' (connecting structures like 'the best usage of a graph' and the 'average graph of graphs' and the 'most used definition of a concept') hasnt been identified/defined yet and is useful to identify

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between interface structures' which can be used to generate 'connection-proving structures' like 'truth-determining networks'
        - identifying useful structures like connections like 'how if some structure is the only possibility left, its required, and is therefore true' as a way to identify truths indirectly by identifying 'problems that can only be solved by one possibility' (the connection to be proven correct) in order to prove that connection is true
        - similarly, applying other 'interface queries' can identify proofs indirectly, bc interface structures are always relevant to some degree, such as 'if the connection to be proven is true, then it determines other connections' as a way of identifying what to find ('other connections determined by the connection to be proven true'), and similarly, 'if the connection to be proven is true, then it can be used to find other structures' (to find 'structures that can be found with the connection to be proven'), and similarly, 'if the connection to be proven is true, then similar variants are also likely to be true', etc for all interface structures (just like previously mentioned as 'true connections interact with other connections, find the connections they interact with' and 'true connections have dependencies, find the dependencies' and 'true connections are based on interface variables including independent variables which act like bases, find the independent variables they are based on or otherwise interact with')
        - the set of these useful queries can be used to create 'truth-determining networks of these connections between certainty structures like truths and related certainty structures like requirements as well as indirectly related structures like dependencies' with nodes like 'if the connection to be proven is true/false' and 'it will have requirements/dependencies/etc or contradictions/vulnerabilities'
        - 'finding the variant of a connection that is most provable' is a related intent that hasnt been solved for yet (the 'most provable variant' involving existing identified definitions and identifying whether differences in those definitions can provide the variation required for the proof)
        - identifying 'whether components of a connection are true or relevant (meaning "whether components are infinite" in this case)' (identifying whether an even 'sequence' is infinite, identifying whether an odd 'sequence' is infinite) and identifying whether invalidating independent variables are irrelevant (identifying whether 'interim sequences could not exist') as a proxy for identifying whether the 'type interaction between the sequences' is infinite or has no limits) is another example of identifying variants to prove (prove that 'components are true' + 'independent variables dont intervene' to prove that the 'type interaction is infinite') 
            - this is 'conceptual math' in that the structures of truth required to equal/create another truth are identifiable by 'variation or coverage' equality (does 'components being true' and 'no intervening independent variables' cover all the 'relevant variation of the problem space')
            - relatedly, relevance structures can be matched with queries to identify them, like identifying the 'structure that is relevant to prove a connection' can be found with queries like 'extremes of n connectible definitions' to match the 'variation or interaction required' (it will have to interact with some independent variable or it will have to have n variation) as determined by what is not sufficient to solve the problem (adjacent structures are not sufficient, so higher variation is required, or all independent variables except this subset have been connected to the problem structure, so the solution is likely in the subset)
        - relatedly, infinite sequences/sets are useful for applying iterations (once a structure is identified as part of an infinite sequence, a lot of other info is identified as connectible to that structure), which means structures with high info content like infinite sequences are useful to identify/connect, similar to how independent variables like interface variables are useful to connect

    - identifying useful structures like 'structure/graph sequence alignments' that are possible and useful to identify for common/general problem-solving intents like 'type classification'
        - identifying useful 'sequences of symmetries to resolve ambiguities' like 'comparing very different points on a similarity index network, then comparing different variants of a type', where the similarities start as higher in complexity (a similarity such as 'occurring on the same network of similarities' which allows extreme differences to occur) compared to a core similarity like 'having the same type', is useful as a way to generate sequences of graphs to generate an answer like a 'type classification' by applying the sequence of complexity resolutions that can remove/standardize non-type determining differences, and therefore generate interface queries as having specific useful sequences of similarities as compounding filters, as a way of applying 'networks of clarifying questions' into interface queries (identifying what is useful to clarify first, out of the set of possible similarities like 'occurring on the same similarity index network')
            - this involves identifying what structure sequences can be useful ('type interactions' -> 'type variants' -> 'type classification') and what sequences of graphs can implement that sequence ('type similarity index network')
            - similarly, identifying useful sequences like whether a structure 'cant have meaning/relevance' if it 'doesnt identify/apply truth' ('truth' is a required input to 'meaning' intents) to identify 'sequences of intents' that can be applied in interface queries, which is useful to identify 'specific "interface structures of graphs" that can apply these required intents' (like 'applying truth, by integrating a comparison to "at least one or some ratio" of probable/realistic/approximation networks as reflections of truth')
        - relatedly, structures like 'rings' of 'type interactions' are useful to 'identify as possibly useful' ('possibly useful' as in identifying the 'efficiency of a ring' and a 'structure that hasnt been standardized to that efficiency yet' like a 'type interaction') and 'identify specific useful variants of' (as in identifying the specific function creating the ring structure and identifying the interface structures of the type interaction that are likely connectible with the same function), as a way to generate all 'variants of a type interaction' (or all of its 'useful interface interactions', or other useful variants of other interface structures of the type interaction) by applying the same function to generate the next variant
        - relatedly, identifying 'interface metrics' like 'complexity/validity' of graphs and structures of these interface metrics like 'similarities like alignments' in interface metrics of a graph like 'complexity/validity' by identifying all the structures that emerge in 2-d interface variable graphs of a graph (2-d graphs like 'complexity given validity' of a graph and the specific structures associated with interface variables like 'complexity of position, given nearest valid average') is useful for identifying graphs that 'apply/enable interface similarities', as well as identifying new graphs
            - identifying the 'interactions with other graphs' (like the interactions with variants of itself), the 'iterations that identify emergent similarities/differences from definitions in a graph', and the 'similarities that emerge from queries' are all intents where identifying the interface graphs (like 2-d interface variable graphs) of these intents and their related structures can add value
            - predicting the similarities/differences that emerge from a graph with iteration/complication/variation/usage is possible by applying structures until 'some threshold of difference is reached to identify a pattern from an example', like by applying a 'next node generating function' until a pattern like 'adjacent opposites' is identifiable, or by working backwards from 'what patterns would be identifiable' and the 'requirements for the first identification of those patterns'
            - the 'ratio that represents some optimized metric on a graph spectrum' is a useful example of a ratio that stores a lot of info, where identifying this ratio on a graph spectrum can be useful for graph-selecting/generating queries where an upper/lower bound or threshold is identified as useful
        - relatedly, integrating the structures like 'upper/lower bounds' identified with some set of interface variables (like the upper/lower bound truth such as the 'most/least possible it could be true') is likely to be useful in filtering solution sets
        - relatedly, questions like 'whether spacetime structures can be manipulated by sets/ratios/structures of interface similarities' (like 'at what point can some set of requirements determine a result, even when incentives contradict the result') are relevant for determining reality (as in reality-engineering like 'changing interface variables to create determining variables to change spacetime structures to allow variation to develop')

    - identifying useful structures like 'variables like dimension count' that interact with 'similarities' to form possible useful graphs like 'graphs of data sets that separate solution data point subsets into their own layer', given that subsets of the data set are differently valid and the adjacency of invalid subsets indicates there are valid separations to identify valid/solution subsets of data points (like a rotation and rotation-moving function, where the outermost points of the rotations are invalid)
        - for example, applying a 'higher dimension count' can store/clarify info like 'a layer that contains most data points of the original data set (a similarity in the "ratio of data set represented")', and similarly, there are 'metric changes (like dimension count changes) and similarity applications' that can possibly separate the solution function into its own layer or other similarity, consistently
            - this means 'identifying functions that identify average/other similar functions efficiently', such as where a 'moving rotation explains a data set, and the outermost points are invalid', by identifying that invalid points are adjacent/identifiable to this 'rotation-moving function', which involves identifying the first case of an invalid/valid pair, and positioning the valid pair higher, and then finding a traveral that continues on the valid layer or increases the validity, given the position of previous valid/invalid points
            - this can be implemented with an algorithm that 'looks backwards in time at identified errors/solutions (including invalid/valid points)' to evaluate whether a structure with some ratio of success at describing some ratio of points continues to be a good 'local predictor' compared to other 'local predictor' structures, starting at some random or invalid point and traversing the data set by 'adjacency/other similarity', to find 'filters of invalid/valid points in a data set that can be re-applied at other local subsets'
        - relatedly, there are 'ways to change dimension count that are useful in identifying specific useful info', like how 'lower-dimensional "cross-sections" of a higher dimensional object can still represent the "variables" of the original object' and 'higher dimensional "state sequences" of a structure can represent "useful interactions" of that structure', where the useful dimension-changes are identifiable as being more probably useful ('identifying a dimension count change, dimension count change type, dimension count change type similarity, and a dimension count change type similarity that is more useful' being the useful sequence to abstract, such as 'identifying a solution metric change, solution metric change type, solution metric change type similarity, and a solution metric change type similarity that is more useful')
        - relatedly, graphs of 'iterated independent variable sequences (like specific-abstract-cause to identify generators/causes of specific abstractions)' are useful to generate and filter

    - identifying useful structures like solution structure networks (like 'solution similarity networks' like 'problem/solution similarity combination networks') and the structures that are useful to connect them to (like 'solution metric networks')
        - for example, 'solution structure (like problem/solution similarity combination) networks' and 'solution metric interaction networks' are useful to connect to other solution structures like connecting 'a solution type/variation similarity combination' (for example, how "general probiotics" are similar by 'general type similarity' with identified solutions like "specific useful microbes" and also 'similar in complexity/variation' to the problem complexity/variation of "metabolic problems" or "cancer") with 'solution metrics (like accuracy)' (connecting to accuracy to answer questions like 'how accurate is a solution that has a general type similarity to identified solutions and a variation similarity to the problem')

    - identifying useful structures like 'interim intent networks' that can solve problems like 'selecting intent sequences/combinations to filter possible connections'
        - for example, 'useful interim intents' can be identified, like 'no variable denominators' and 'extrapolate common factors' and 'reduce common factors' and 'separate variables on different sides of the equation', which are useful for intents like 'identify possible values of a variable in an equation', so identifying the "network of these 'useful interim intents' and their interactions (like their 'contradictions')" is useful for solving that problem, given that not all of these intents will be useful/possible when applied in a sequence/combination
            - similarly, identifying the 'boundary-crossing changes' is valuable to connect to other structures like formats, like how formatting an equation so that 'one side is a non-1 factor multiplied by the variable to identify possible values of' is useful as a general solution structure to solve for, where once that boundary is crossed so that the equation is formatted that way, the problem is usually approximately solved
                - as another example of 'boundary-crossing changes', solving the problem of 'whether even/odd numbers always alternate' can be solved by identifying that 'formatting the definition as a sequence' is useful for solving the problem (the 'sequential definition of even/odd definitions' is 'sequences of even/odd numbers are created by adding two to the previous even/odd number'), where this 'sequential definition' is more useful at proving that this type interaction 'generally holds' bc the problem involves describing the infinite 'sequence', where finding these 'boundaries to cross' (like highly interactive/independent variables to interact with such as formats) can be useful in solving the problem
                - for an example of a specific algorithm, 'checking the limits of problem structure definitions to see if they cross a useful boundary (like checking whether an extreme possible in a problem structure definition is more similar to the solution state or solution set/metrics)' is a simple example of looking for useful 'boundary-crossings' (beyond just looking for interface interactions like 'overlaps', since a 'useful boundary to cross' is a relevant structure to specify)
                - at these boundaries, its possible to connect to the problem, and its possible to connect to the solution, so these boundaries act like useful vertexes
            - similarly, 'irreducibilities' are useful in the same way that 'standardizations' are useful (find irreducibilities to find constants/similarities/connections) to identify 'determining variables', where 'sequences/networks of determining variables' are useful to identify (like how its often useful to connect to generality/specificity first, or how specification tends to lose general info except when the 'specific structures are abstract concepts', so identifying sequences like 'specify, as in identify specific abstract concepts and their interactions, to retain general info' is useful)
        - relatedly, a graph of 'useful general rules and the contexts where they become less useful bc some boundary is crossed' is an example of an abstract/specific graph that is possible to identify
        - relatedly, identifying that there are 'scales where a similarity holds and where iteration on the scale negates the similarity' is useful, like how 'creating two infinite sets from one' is possible but not infinitely repeatable (creating all infinite sets from one is not possible bc 'one infinite set is not equal to all infinite sets' and there are infinite sets that are 'variably capable of creating all other infinite sets than some infinite sets')
        - relatedly, problem types like 'info barriers' can hide each other so identifying these interactions like 'sequences of info barriers' that create other problems like 'hidden problems' is useful to identify as a 'problem-creating network of problems'

    - identifying useful structures like 'spectrums of graph metrics' that are useful for intents like 'avoiding simplifying extremes of a spectrum'
        - for example, identifying 'minimum dimension count for a useful structure to exist' would identify 6 dimensions as useful for 'alternate network state sequences with different starting points/change functions' and 3 dimensions for identifying 'intersections of graph manifolds' and 'cross-network similarity indexes', which connects specific solution metrics like 'graph dimension count' with other solution structures like 'useful graph variables/variants' to identify 'areas and starting points for queries'
            - I thought of this when thinking about how to identify 'errors in fossil slices', like identifying 'parasites/cancer from a tissue sample fossil', which is more solvable with 3 dimensions where 'negative component clusters' like 'cancer' are more adjacently derivable, and how these specific metrics are useful/possible to filter as well as connect to other solution structures like 'useful graph variables/variants', allowing queries like 'whats the 3-d graph solution' to be used to filter queries by proxies of solution metrics like complexity, as well as 'queries with dimension counts that avoid approximations' and other similarly useful query filters
        - alternatively, identifying structures that would create 'miraculously lucky best-case circumstances' like 'infinity indexes/networks' or 'alternate randomness-source networks' are at the other end of the spectrum of graphs than graphs with 'determining/default' metrics like 'dimension count' that dont try to optimize for minimizing info, just organizing info which has a net effect of minimizing dimension of high dimensional structures (a 2-d graph of high dimensional structures like infinities/concepts is likely to be useful across problems and reducing dimension requirements of other problem-solving processes), where, like with other spectrums, interim graphs in between are likelier to be more useful than either 'dimension count-determined graphs' (graphs whose meaningful/determining requirement is based only on the dimension count) and 'high dimensional structure 2-d networks'

    - identifying useful structures like 'relevant problems which can identify a solution by their similarities/intersections' and connections to generate these relevant problems to identify solutions by connections between these problems, similar to how an upper/lower range of solutions is useful for finding solutions in between those limits
        - connecting 'problems that are useful in discovering solutions' related to a 'connection between a variable set (like linearity/randomness)' to identify 'constants (like pi) encoding those variable set connections', these constants being an uncommon solution type in that theyre reusable with trivial changes, such as connecting problems like 'problems involving connecting different structures relevant to a circle (radius/circumference, ratios like sine, intersections with structures like units like the unit circle)', where the 'connections between these problems' are useful in 'generating another relevant problem that is related to the original problem and will likely interact with the solution to the original problem', where one problem is identified and a probable connection is also known (probable connection between radius/circumference or angles related to sine ratios, given the connection between sine ratios and the radius/circumference connection), which solves the problem of 'how to identify problems that are relevant and will probably both interact with the same solution structure, to derive the solution structure by the similarities between these relevant problems', and also identifies the possibility of solution structures like constants that can connect variable sets like 'linearity/randomness'
        - relatedly, given a complex system like the bio-system, the following similarities are useful to identify:
            - 'type similarities' like 'health across types' like 'plant/plant health' (what plants make plants healthy) or 'plant/human health (what plants are healthy in a way that could also help humans' or 'general human survival' (what plants have increased survival of humans who use them) applies a general solution metric like 'health' across similar/relevant structures (rather than solving for a specific solution to a specific health problem, solve for the general problem of 'health')
            - similarly, 'complex tastes of a substance' has a similarity with 'multi-functionality' which can be useful for identifying useful substances for health
            - similarly, 'causes (like subconscious) of proxies like names of substances' can indicate 'similar substance functions by similar names', which applies similarities in 'causal sequence' and 'approximations' in a sequence
            - these general similarities make the 'maximal differences from these similarities' useful to identify (what plants arent healthy in some way like having fungus infections, arent known to improve survival of other plants or humans, dont have evolved defenses against attacks to oppose predators, but are still useful for human health), since a complex system will allow very different solution structures to exist, as there is likely a way that even very different structures from solutions can be useful, even though a useful workflow is 'change a base solution trivially to generate other more optimal solutions', which is a useful opposing structure that is nevertheless likely to apply across workflows (as in 'maximal differences from workflows are likely useful for some problem subset')
        - relatedly, typical problem-solving structures involve 'specifications of abstractions' (type/example connections), 'abstract-specific' (type/constant connections) and 'specific-specific' (truth connections) connections, which imply a cross-interface or cross-spectrum connection to involve 'enough variation between relevant variables' to be useful

    - identifying useful structures like 'general rules (like identify "areas of opposites/similars' or similarly "linear separations" to identify structures like similarities/limits of solutions/errors)' that havent been used to create a graph yet (like a 'graph of all general similarities like general type interactions and their opposites') to identify 'similarities between types/opposites' that can be used to implement the general rules
        - this involves identifying a 'cluster of opposing structures' like 'change/input/connection/interactivity limits/barriers/constants' as a useful structure to identify opposites like 'possible connections like general type interactions' ('general similarities' like 'type interactions' have opposites like 'interactivity limits' as well as interim structures like 'specific similarities' which can be used to derive 'general similarities'), which is similar to 'finding an error (limit/specification) network to find a solution (connection/generalization) network'
            - similarly, another rule that hasnt been applied yet is 'identifying connections between upper/lower ranges to identify solution positions' such as by identifying similarities in a higher-dimensional iterated graph of structures like 'general volatile type interactions' and lower-dimensional graph 'general interactions' and the connections between these graphs, which are both sufficiently different from extremes (given some minimum dimension necessary for some interaction to occur) and similar enough to the original graph to be relevant to connect (where similar interactions can be expected to hold)
            - an iterated version of this graph would apply similarities between other structures to create clusters ('type interactions' and 'abstract connections' being in the same cluster, and 'specific limits' and 'interactivity barriers' being on the other), like an iterated variant of the 2-d similarity/difference concept cluster graph, where connecting these iterated clusters to other iterated structures (like 'concept combinations' or 'cross-interface structures') is similarly useful
        - relatedly, identifying similar/interim structures (as opposed to opposites) is useful by reducing the problem to 'identifying the direction of solutions from the interim structures' as opposed to 'identifying change limits to identify opposites from solutions'
        - relatedly, 'differences from opposite functions' is a possible useful function to apply to 'filter solution functions', given that a 'subset of a function integrating with its opposite' is a 'worst-case scenario' in predicting a function from a subset

    - identifying useful structures like similarities like 'overlaps' between simple/complex structures like 'points/spectrums' is useful as an alternate way to connect cross-interface structures (such as 'connect definition points/spectrums to identify extreme differences to check for generality')
        - for example, identifying that an 'overlap between a point and a spectrum' exists is useful, such as how identifying that a position overlaps with a spectrum can indicate adjacent structures ('if its on this spectrum, it can adjacently be any value on the spectrum, if there are no other independent variables on the spectrum like type thresholds' is a useful way to infer possible structures, just like 'extremes of overlapping definitions' are a useful way to infer possible structures), just like 'identifying useful structures (like types) for avoiding iterations' is useful in identifying 'whether a type interaction generalizes or is absolute' for example
            - similarly, its more useful to identify when a point overlaps with a graph, overlaps with a graph of graphs, etc, to increase the value (as in 'extreme difference') of the inferrable possibilities (if it exists on this graph and theres an overlap with another graph, that is an extreme difference made possible using those graphs, and 'extreme differences' are useful for identifying 'generality/absoluteness')
            - this is similar to how other structures like 'filtered structures (like ranges)' are useful to identify other structures like 'specificity'
            - identifying the structures that 'prevent inference from being adjacent using other structures' (like 'type thresholds that prevent any point on a spectrum from being reachable from any other point' which prevent spectrums from making inference adjacent) is useful, and identifying the 'maximally inference-preventing structures' (like 'overlapping layers of type thresholds' or 'spectrum-invalidating positions') is useful to solve for
            - this connects inference structures ('definitions/requirements') to specific structures ('spectrums/graphs') in a useful way, beyond other structures like 'types/abstractions' which also add efficiencies
            - relatedly, similar to how its possible to infer from definitions a 'simple pattern (like even/odd) in an integer line' (as in 'given the definition of integer/even, it couldnt follow any other pattern'), there is a graph that makes every problem's solution required as the only possibility, so identifying the 'only possibility graph' (which leaves the solution as the only possibility) is a relevant problem-solving intent (identify the graph like an 'integer line' that makes a solution defined/identified/filtered/required as the only possibility, given some variable possible on the graph like 'evenness/oddness', for problems where the graph isnt specified and not defined by the variable, different from how 'evenness' is defined with 'factors/remainders' rather than 'integers' but 'integer' is implied)
        - relatedly, identifying 'maximally coordinating priority sets' as 'solution structures' is useful (the priorities that coordinate with the most other priorities are useful to apply as a set of solution metrics and as a base for multi-functional structures)
        - relatedly, its useful to apply the 'abstract-specific direction' as a way to generate structures given how there is a 'one-to-many connection' and similarly, applying other 'similarities in function/intent metadata and structures' to automate other functions
        - relatedly, its useful to identify where on the 'abstract-specific spectrum' volatility and other useful comparison concepts occur (whether concepts like volatility are the comparisons between the highest variation/most abstract concepts) and what this means for new useful concepts, whether there is a limit on abstraction that has already been reached by 'interface variable statements that describe anything'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify how to usefully specify abstractions with comparison concepts like volatility so that meaningless abstractions which can refer to anything can become relevant (with queries like 'identify useful extreme differences possible in overlaps in sequences of definitions of comparison concepts like volatility to decrease abstraction, for example starting with volatility and iterating through other change comparison concepts')
        - relatedly, establishing a sufficient 'ratio of non-volatility of an error function' to determine that there is 'still some uncertainty to identify, regarding comparisons of minimums' but that the function is not too volatile to require workflows like 'trial and error'
            - relatedly, other 'comparisons of minimums' are useful to identify ('minimums across error functions', 'relevant minimums such as adjacent/approximate minimum or the sufficient minimum to differentiate most relevant types')

    - identifying useful structures like 'errors/solutions of relevance structures (like identifying a missing relevance base)' to fulfill a problem-solving intent like 'cross a relevance ratio'
        - for example, solving the problem of 'identifying interface solution metrics (like "how many interface structures are required to specify relevance/meaning")' is useful to identify interface queries to identify relevant structures (such as how a 'type interaction' can indicate a lot of relevant information like the 'difference between independence types' or irrelevant information like the "difference between two molecules' electron counts", where one type interaction is not relevant on its own but can become more relevant bc of interactivity/context as in 'if those two electrons control a bomb and are entangled', which requires one additional variable to be extremely relevant like 'whether it controls a highly interactive variable (like a bomb) that will change a lot of other variables, including a cascade that can result in interactions with almost all variables')
            - for example, a value can be relatively meaningless unless its associated with a 'high relevance' context that contains all the meaning, whereas some numbers have default relevance (like the 'first number of a type that can help define randomness by an example calculation') as in 'with this specific high relevance context, any number of this type or in this range would be meaningful'
            - relatedly, identifying structures that have 'stable/absolute meaning' is non-trivial, such as how 'comparative meaning' is often easily changed by other interface interactions, and identifying a structure that is always meaningful is non-trivial, like my workflow-generating methods, such as 'graphs that regularly replace nodes with recently identified useful structures with varying abstraction levels', and once these are identified, identifying the 'ways they can become meaningless' (a graph like this can become less meaningful if the graph identifies a variable set that easily predicts changes between useful structures, at which point that variable set is the next more absolutely useful structure) is useful to identify the next more absolutely meaningful structures
                - this can be applied to identify the next intents in a sequence (once a useful graph is identified, start identifying its emergent descriptive variables of its useful interactions like its useful usages) which can be used to optimize current intent implementations and optimize intent connections, as well as identify when 'intents possible in a system, given its variables, are fulfilled'
            - connecting all of these 'sets of relevance-creating structures (like a set containing a "high relevance context and a number set that maintains/completes the relevance")' is a problem-solving intent, to switch between relevant structure sets as 'default solutions (or queries to find/create solutions)'
            - this can be used to identify when a 'missing base of relevance' is required to identify and compare to, in order to reach 'relevance above some ratio'
            - relatedly, identifying the 'iterable units creating interface variables like volatility of numbers, their interface structures like intersections, and their most volatile points' is useful to identify 'units to apply, thresholds to cross, and directions to move in' to find a relevant number type
            - relatedly, identifying meaning that can be 'falsifiable with context' is useful to identify 'uncertainty areas'
            - otherwise, other relevance structures include 'relevance across all interfaces' (relevant on every interface) and 'relevance across all relevant structures' (relevant on every useful graph), which identifies intents like 'identify interface structures like new connections/patterns/similarities/optimizations across multiple relevant graphs' as a general problem-solving intent, and 'minimal/maximal relevance' to identify ranges/limits on relevance (it has to at the very least mean 'random/totally irrelevant', and at the very most can mean 'everything', in situations like where a singularity is possible/relevant), and 'cross-interface descriptions/definitions of relevance' as useful for filtering interface queries
        - relatedly, identifying 'structural causes' for why a 'minimum might be far from a starting point' such as 'a general pattern emerges during iteration that is difficult to identify/specify from a subset (since it doesnt repeat in the subset size/range)' and 'ambiguous or ambiguity-creating subsets are adjacent' can be useful to specify a 'minimum ratio of an input range to sample'
        - relatedly, identifying structures of 'abstract similarities' like their overlaps is useful to identify cross-interface structures to filter interface queries (these are relevant structures by default which will probably be a useful component of interface queries, given that multiple similarities are usually required to solve a problem and connections between abstract similarities are useful and abstract similarities are useful as a general/base solution to apply the trivial function of specifying, like how its useful to specify a similar 'specific implementation' of a 'abstract/general intent' like 'connect problem/solution', which are related abstract similarities like 'intent/requirement' and 'implementation/requirement' which provide alternate connection routes between abstract structures), just like its useful to identify a similarity like a 'common base' between a 'required similarity/difference', and how 'abstract solutions' and 'abstract requirements' are similarly useful to connect, and how 'specific limits' are useful to connect (being at the other end of a cross-interface spectrum than 'abstract similarities'), where these 'structures like clusters of interface variables at positions on structures like spectrums' might contain relevant differences (where differences are other interface structures, useful variable sets, useful graphs, etc) similar to how the 2-d similarity/difference concept cluster network contains relevant differences

    - identifying useful structures like adjacent structures to move the problem to a related structure position is a way to solve for the relevance of the original structures
        - for example, checking for a 'requirement/dependency between types' is another way to identify generality/absoluteness of a type interaction, to solve the problem of 'whether relevant structures like dependencies hold generally' instead
        - relatedly, independence types are useful to identify like similarity types are useful
        - whether a 'more/less independent type pair is connectible' (whether a more/less independent problem is solvable) is a related problem to solve to identify lower/upper ranges of relevance for a given type interaction

    - identify useful structures like 'cross-relevance areas/subsets of a function' that can be connected to help with other connection intents like 'predicting one subset from another'
        - a useful intent related to the task of 'predicting a function from a subset' is 'identifying groups of cross-relevance variables and variable relevance areas' like how a variable may only be relevant at a higher value, which is useful for predicting randomness in a function, so a connection between 'irrelevant/relevant areas for this variable' is useful to identify and apply as a way to 'predict remaining subsets of other functions', similar to how its useful/possible to connect 'subsets/areas with different randomness' (to predict the more random subset from the other subset)
        - relatedly, identifying primary 'abstract connections/similarities' first and identifying their secondary connections next is a useful way to derive other connections, like how 'identifying whether the abstract variant of a type interaction is true' is a useful alternative to 'identifying whether the unit variant is true', similar to how 'working backwards' (from the most general abstract connections to find limits of specific connections) is useful, where identifying this 'network of the most abstract connections' is a first step to identifying 'connections between abstract structures (like abstract combinations/groups/networks)' that are likely to be more useful for 'identifying specific connections' like whether a 'specific type interaction is generally true or has relevant limits' (rather than just identifying whether a type has an interaction with an abstraction, identifying whether it has interactions with structures of abstractions, to determine the structure/limits of the type interaction)
            - similarly, "identifying whether one type in a 'type interaction' has interactivity with an independent/abstract/interface variable that the other type doesnt" is a useful example of a filter for 'equivalence-invalidations' between these types that can determine whether the equivalence driving the interaction holds, just like how "identifying whether a type has an asymptote and the other doesnt" is useful to filter 'equivalence-invalidations' and how identifying 'isolatabilities' is useful for filtering 'equivalence-invalidations' (to identify variables that are 'unlikely or defined/required not to interact with invalidating variables', as in 'independent variables' of 'invalidating variables')
            - relatedly, working backwards from the reason for a determining variable that invalidates an equivalence, such as identifying 'what good reasons would be for a type interaction being generally true' such as 'that the types both occur on a spectrum of linear increases (not capable of producing volatility) where upper/lower type interactions all hold generally' and checking for those reasons
        - relatedly, whether a network can 'use vs. store' the functions it identifies (can it use a specification/definition function to improve its over-abstract functions) is a useful semantic metric for neural networks

    - identify useful structures like 'isolated reasons' which can be held to be usefully true (such as generally true or true even at extreme scales) bc of an 'identified type-preserving equivalence' and 'isolatability from independent variables' which allows this isolation to hold
        - for example, identifying an interaction between types that is true only bc of the definitions of those types (in isolation of other interactions) is useful to identify 'truths that will always be true, even at extreme scales, while those types are interacting/true'
            - generally, identifying an 'isolated reason within the definitions of the "high variation variables"' is the useful intent to optimize for when 'identifying information about extremely independent variables' (like inferring info about extreme differences like 'infinities' from info about unit components/generators of those extreme differences) using a high variation variable like a 'type' that interacts with those variables (high variation variables like types/sequences/iterations that contain a lot of information)
            - being able to 'isolate a reason (find a reason using only the specified isolated structures like type definitions)' is useful, to 'isolate a reason to facts/definitions/etc' when required
            - generally, other structures can be identified from this insight, such as that an asymmetry can intervene with these preserved scaled effects to create a limit on the type interaction rather than allowing it to continue indefinitely, similar to how an independent variable could change the type interaction at different scales if the type definition interaction doesnt account for that variable (if one effect eventually overcomes the other, it can create a limit that prevents the preserved equality of the type interaction at extreme scales, so it matters whether a trivial difference is detectable at unit scales to determine if the equivalence between types will be preserved, thereby preserving their interaction), so identifying whether a 'difference is possible to create using these isolated reasons (only using the type definitions)' is similarly useful to identify, as an alternative to the original intent of 'identifying an isolated reason using only the definitions', and identifying the interactions of the 'type definition-based interaction' with all relevant independent variables is similarly useful to identify at unit or other useful scales, to ensure that there will be no independent variables changing the behavior of the type interaction at different scales
            - this is related to 'identifying the limits of the type definition, by applying the definitions of independent variables to identify its limits' and 'identifying the interaction of those limits with the relevant type interaction'
        - relatedly, identifying that an interface structure like a concept is missing in a problem is a matter of 'identifying position/limits/directions of variables, so that the positions/directions that are not used yet is trivial' or 'identifying that iterations are still required, indicating that a concept is missing to skip the iteration'
            - relatedly, intents like 'identifying specific structures of useful structures like the "maximum difference" between useful structures' is useful/possible to identify, to predict the 'probable/required positions' of these structures
        - related to 'using ai to train ai', 'identifying the info of what parameters are required to connect x/y' is basically 'pre-solving the problem of connecting x/y or identifying the variation required to connect x/y and what parameters can create that variation', but this can be solved by identifying the ways to make 'configuration areas/connections robust' so that 'similar configurations produce similar results', so that big changes in results only occur bc of 'identified intersections with other variables like limits' and other changes are relatively similar/trivial, and therefore all thats required by the ai that selects parameters is to 'identify which area of parameters to randomly select a position to start from' (an area with similar performance that doesnt cross these change-creating structures like limits), to avoid randomness-generating complexity or other forms of info loss created by applying AI to select every decision which could fulfill any interface function of errors (like 'compound errors', 'neutralize errors', 'simplify errors', 'randomize errors', 'hide errors', etc) without much of a bias, and identifying graphs of params that avoid suboptimal functions of errors is possible/useful for the intent of 'identifying useful parameters'
            - the problem of applying 'graphs to graphs' or 'networks to networks' is in applying such complex structures that some interactions possible with those applications are not identified, which invalidate some relevant similarity/difference, like introducing a new variable that invalidates some relevant intent, so that info is randomized/lost (such as by being over-abstracted/specified) rather than identified
            - 'allowing the network to change its parameters, within that area of similar parameters', is another possibility that can add value once these graphs are identified
            - 'integrated cross-interface parameters' like 'neuron counts + function sequences + change/specificity potential + error minimum-finding potential across functions' is probably useful for the intent of 'identifying useful parameters', rather than leaving them isolated, given that some of their net effects are connectible across interfaces

    - identifying useful structures like 'structures with unidentified variables/hidden variation' like the 'query definition' or the 'specific implementation of the intent of a graph' as well as useful structures that can be identified with that implementation like 'optimized graph subsets and optimized graph subset connections'
        - for example, given that a graph is 'connections of specific structures' and queries are 'sequences/sets/directions/positions of connections of specific structures', the point of a graph is not just to 'compress it to a point on a graph of graphs after identifying the unidentified similarities/differences made possible by the graph', but also to specifically implement that intent by 'identifying the "optimized subset of possible sequences on the graph" that create interface structures like relevance', which is a new problem-solving intent to implement as a component/filter of queries (identify the relevance structures made possible by a graph), so that other intents can be fulfilled like 'connect a graph with its optimized subset/variant, given its interface structures'
        - relatedly, identifying 'query variants' like 'limits of connections of specific structures' (as opposed to 'sets/sequences/directions/positions of connections', which are 'queries') and identifying 'patterns of queries on graphs' is useful to identify 'emergent similarities', as referenced elsewhere, so identifying these 'structures of queries' (and importantly, their connections to 'similarities/differences') is useful, like identifying these 'structures of graphs' is useful
            - relatedly, identifying 'adjacent intents likely to be fulfilled with a graph' like 'identifying independent but similar intents to the defined intents fulfilled by the graph' is useful to identify what similarities/differences are likely to be resolvable with the graph other than those stated in the graph definition, starting from a useful position like the 'maximally independent similarities' (similar to how 'iterated embeddings' can be useful for creating 'relevance' independently of its definition from a specific starting position, as mentioned elsewhere)
        - relatedly, trajectories in my recent work like 'identifying variables' -> 'identifying networks/bases involving those variables' -> 'identifying variants/structures of those networks' -> 'identifying connections between those networks' -> 'identifying structures of those connections between networks' -> 'identifying connections possible using the network (on the network, like a query)' -> 'identifying structures like variants of those connections on the network' has predictable sequence/limit/variants/other structures (applying variation to new base structures until the important differences are identified)
        - relatedly, identifying and applying similarities to base variation-resolving queries on (with general query structure variations like 'a core general similarity to base specific variation queries on to find specific variations', or 'a specific constant similarity to apply variations in connections to other specific constant similarities') to connect specific structures like 'problem/solution structures' is an example of a useful graph type (similar to the abstract network with specific variants, but with different structures and with only two primary bases, problems/solutions, like the 2-d similarity/difference cluster network), with example implementing graphs like 'apply problem structures as components/nodes of a problem network, and connect them to the same structures for a solution network, to find directions/positions to optimize for queries' or 'apply interface variables as different levels with sequential connections between problem/solution structures preserved, to identify useful structures like useful query patterns', with combination variants like 'apply a graph of interface variable-levels where levels contain different integrated networks (like a abstract/specific concept networks)', where a 'similarity index of integrated/embedded graphs, where the graphs have semantic/relevance and other similarities' is a useful next structure to identify, similar to how a 'similarity index of functions' is useful to identify to solve 'function filter problems' and a 'query similarity index, based on a graph similarity index' is another useful related structure

    - identifying structures like iterations/spectrums/levels of interface structures that intersect with relevance in predictable/identifiable positions/ways is useful to identify useful/relevant structures and apply them as default interface query components
        - for example, an iterated interface structure like 'simple rules of simple rules of simple rules' has a point in its iterations where it becomes 'relevant' (simple rules on their own are generally irrelevant, but 'simple rules of simple rules' like 'simple rules are generally wrong' are generally more relevant), as the levels of iteration cross relevance at some points, so identifying these structures like 'iterated interface structures with a spectrum/level' which cross relevance at some positions and identifying those positions is useful to identify useful base structures of interface queries
            - this is a useful subset of simple rules to identify, which is useful bc it filters the set, it adds complexity and it crosses another level of rules where 'high variation concepts about rules' can be defined which simplify rules enough to allow simple rules to describe rules
            - this creates a useful structure like 'relevance' with an independent connection such as 'iterated embeddings' ('iterated embeddings' isnt in the definition of relevance or its components, but it is useful in creating relevance in this situation compared to the 'set of simple rules', so identifying structures that can cross/create relevance is useful to identify as in 'identify a structure (like another iteration of that iteration, or an iteration spectrum) that can increase the relevance of iterated interface structures like simple rules')
        - relatedly, 'error type networks' applied with 'abstract/specific spectrums' are an example combination graph that can be useful, such as error types like 'over-prioritizations' that are abstract and are specified to interact with more structures, beyond an 'error variable network' ('error types' being a useful specification of 'error variables' on an abstract spectrum of error graphs, specifying how those variables interact/combine)

    - identifying useful structures like 'unused variants of graphs like "interface structures in systems" which embed useful variables like relevance (determining interface variables)' as well as useful interface structures of interface structures like interactions between workflows like 'change a base solution' and 'generate/filter'
        - for example, the reverse like 'filter/generate' abstraction like 'generate/filter' of a workflow like 'generate solutions/filter solutions' is also useful and can be integrated with problem/solution structures in a way that implements another workflow like 'change a base solution'
            - 'reversible sequences' like 'filter/generate' (break a solution into variables and re-combine them to create other solutions) and 'generate/filter' are useful interface structures of interface structures
        - relatedly, a 'determining variable graph' of problem systems indicating info like 'requirements/definitions start to become determining at this position' is more useful than other graphs of interface structures, such as to find 'systems with optimal determining positions of interface structures'
        - relatedly, identifying variables that are high variation enough that they probably contain all types of other variables is useful (for example, types like 'stimulants/sedatives' are high variation enough to contain maximally different functions like 'antimicrobials, anti-cancer substances, and poisons') as well as identifying how these variables can be connected (like where 'poisons' are on the graph of other types and what theyre adjacent to)
        - relatedly, identifying an 'interim graph where similarities/differences generally hold across adjacent variants' (meaning it can trivially generate other useful/true graphs) is likelier to apply a mix of interface variables (rather than being one extreme like only highly abstract or specific) like a 'graph that integrates a system graph, a requirements graph, a determining variable graph, etc' (to be similar enough to these integrated graphs to contain their info but also contain the info of the other graphs, so that trivial variants will create the other graphs and other similarly useful/true/valid graphs)
        - relatedly, a 'super-intelligence' would involve functions of reality-crossing variables and systems, to fulfill queries like 'identify a function that increases this variable above a threshold' trivial even when applied to high-variation variables like infinities and interface structures that involves non-trivial variants of identified structures like 'identify a scalable function that increases the primeness of this variable above the primeness of this infinite sequence using a new polynomial function/structure like a inflection point' where these variables dont interact with any identified structures and which arent near pre-computed limits/structures but are still trivial for the super-intelligence (it will be able to identify a new polynomial type/function/variable to fulfill the request, applying polynomials as a problem-solving format, identify what primeness means for a sequence, compute infinite sequence differences trivially, can increase complex structural metrics like scalability of a function without anything other than a definition, etc, meaning it can compute reality better than any other function)
            - by comparison, current AI models would likely be able to find a function that optimizes for a structural/conceptual solution metric like 'obscurity of inputs and verifiability', but the function would likely be similar/equal to identified functions, rather than being a distant solution for human minds that is only obvious to a computer that uses 'iterated interface structures of interface structures' as its default input, thereby occupying a very distant base to view human tasks from, a position where intersections between requirements/definitions/limits/systems are obvious, and the current AI models would likely struggle with thinking in terms of 'iterated interface structures' like 'usages of graphs of interface graphs'

    - identifying useful structures like rules like 'isolating possibly/probably/definitively irrelevant variables from workflows' and "differentiating workflows from differences like 'reverse' that may result in higher coverage of solutions but not in a relevant/semantic way'" that can be used to filter workflows
        - for example, 'trial and error' has an irrelevant variable of 'sequence' and 'change a base solution' has a possibly irrelevant variable of 'similarity to known solutions' which its biased towards (which is an irrelevant variable in a volatile solution/error graph), which can be relevant or irrelevant in different cases, so 'not allowing irrelevant variables to vary' is a useful filter of workflows, similar to how 'allowing ir/relevant variables to vary' is a useful variable when identifying useful graphs that workflows run on or otherwise use
        - relatedly, identifying workflows that can handle identifying solutions that other workflows miss (like how most workflows would miss the solution if its at the upper/lower limits of a sorted set, unless a 'reverse' is added, which doesnt add semantic/relevant value, so differentiating from just 'reverse workflows' is more useful)
        - relatedly, matching variation across problem/solution formats (like 'there is probably useful variation in this problem format of "identifying a new filter" for a solution with these solution metrics having this variation, given the remaining gaps/variation in this identified interaction level of filters') is useful
        - relatedly, 'identifying unique similarities' is useful, given that 'identifying similarities' is useful but only if those similarities dont apply to everything (only if those similarities are different from identified interface structures like 'ratios such as all' and arent so abstract they apply to everything, where 'all/abstract' have a similarity in that they connect a 'structure/interface' so these connections can be used to generate other solution metrics like the structures of logic/intent/etc, and similarly if the similarity applies to nothing else it is equally useless)
        - relatedly, solving the problem of 'identifying how many solutions there are (identifying the variance of solutions)' is a relevant problem-solving intent that impacts many other intents (if the metadata like number of solutions is identified, many other problems are solved, like 'identifying filters that can filter out a ratio that is likely to leave that number remaining' and 'identifying useful workflows to identify structures of solutions with that number like solution networks/grids having some specificity/interval allowing that number or identifying clusters having that number in the set')
            - similarly 'identifying useful solution similarities/differences and their variables to create different variants' is useful, such as 'differences from other possible solutions (as in unique solutions)' and "similarities to a full solution set (with different possible solution structures like 'complementary subsets of solution variables' or a 'highly covering solution of solution metrics')"

    - identifying useful structures like 'connectible variables like "error function solution metrics" and "network configurations"' which are useful to connect in a problem-solving format like 'neural networks'
        - identifying queries to create 'network configurations with high probability of low volatility error functions' (as in the 'difference created by the network is usually similar for adjacent inputs') can be applied as a useful problem-solving intent, by 'identifying network subsets that can produce some set of changes that can create low volatility error functions, and then only allowing the subsets that can stay in that range'
            - relatedly, reverse-engineering useful network configurations can be done by starting from 'useful/optimal error functions' like 'error functions with one minimum' and 'identifying inputs likely to be near minimums' and 'identifying network configurations that can create increasing change in either direction from a particular input where error is minimized', since 'selecting inputs to optimize for by minimizing error at those points' is a useful related possible intent
        - relatedly, queries to solve meta-graph problems like 'queries to create useful/optimal/solution graph structures like "useful/optimal/solution graph clusters/averages/patterns/minima" in a direction of change applied to a graph or graph of graphs' are useful to identify graphs that will make some 'set of remaining uncertain differences' trivial
        - relatedly, its useful to differentiate between 'base/network/cluster/type/format/standard/interface/similarity' bc of the implications/related structures of these concepts, such as how 'bases imply an origin, suboptimality, foundationality, etc' whereas networks dont have these associations, and where bases are useful as 'limit' structures
            - these differences in definitions indicate different useful graphs/workflows, such as how 'bases can be used as an original solution to identify new useful variants' (apply changes to bases) and 'standards/types can be used to remove irrelevant differences' (apply standards to identify relevant differences to connect) and 'networks can be optimized to connect maximal differences adjacently (as in first/prioritized)' (try maximal differences first to resolve problems), and 'similarity networks can be used to connect problems/solutions on the similarity network' (identify "positions/connections of problems/solutions" on the similarity network)

    - identifying useful structures like 'structure-variable connections' like 'definition validity' which can be applied as similarity/difference structures to connect problem/solution structures like 'problem definition and solution metric networks'
        - identifying 'infinite sets' as 'having a relevant type equivalence across a function' (infinites can be created with other infinities) is non-trivial to identify as a useful intent in the Banach-Tarski paradox, bc the 'set of all points in an area' is an unusual definition of the area that is still valid/true (rather than being metaphorical or approximate), which connects the problem with a useful format ('infinite sets') using the 'similarity in validity of different definitions', which identifies 'similarities/differences' in interface variables like 'validity' of structures like 'definitions' as useful to fulfill similarities/differences in queries, which identifies other useful similarities/differences (like a 'similarity in definition validity, difference in requirement generality/accuracy') to connect problems/solutions and their variables
        - relatedly, identifying 'whether a point belongs to a type/group' can be done by iterating/identifying 'all possible subset filters of the data set variables, where the resulting subset has a ratio above some randomness/outlier ratio' (each set containing more than one point, for example) and applying filters (like 'probabilities') to those subset divisions
        - relatedly, compared to graph structures like an 'abstract graph sheave', its useful to identify why a 'fractal graph' isnt as relevant/useful as other graphs (a 'fractal graph' has a similarity in structure that may coincide with some useful similarity in 'general vs. specific variables' or 'embedded variables' but is not guaranteed/defined to identify these depending on how the graph is constructed, and may not identify other useful variable interactions)
        - relatedly, differentiating ambiguous structures like 'possibilities/requirements' is useful since they can easily be conflated in some cases like 'one-example inference' (just bc an answer like true/false is 'possible' doesnt equal a 'requirement' to be either in any other case, regardless of whether these values are stable/real)
        - relatedly, identifying graph metadata is useful to 'connect graphs/queries', such as how identifying the 'maximal differences connectible with a query on a graph' or 'average query performance on a graph' or the 'defining query of a graph' is useful for describing/differentiating the graph
        - relatedly, a 'graph of general solution metrics subsets and specific subsets of other solution metrics to complement them, since its generally useful to optimize for a subset of metrics across metric types' is a useful graph to start extending definitions of solution metrics (with additional specifying layers like 'functions used to implement the general-specific metric set, then interface structures generated with these functions applied to implement solution metrics, then specific interfaces like math to connect the metrics/functions to useful structures generated by those functions or which are likely to be systems containing problem differences that its useful to connect specific functions/structures to')
        - relatedly, applying 'aligned similarity sequences' can be useful, such as applying 'definition/requirements' and 'truth/validity' sequences to identify useful differences from initial structures like 'definitions' by applying these similarities (like 'true definitions and valid requirements' to identify structures like 'interface manifolds of these structures (by applying interface changes)' and their 'useful limits' and 'useful variants/specifications to connect'), and similarly its useful to identify 'similarities/equivalences in variables of interface structures' like 'similarity/equivalence in definition/requirement validity' so these similarities can be applied to filter interface queries, such as by 'applying a similarity in system validity, so any similar/relevant structure to that system, like a structure possible in that system, is also valid by default', which is useful to identify structures like 'limits of info possible to generate/derive, by applying only validity'
        - relatedly, the variables of relevance like 'relevance validity' are useful to identify as a 'graph of graphs' to filter interface queries (applying the relevance base, based on validity, as in comparing the base of relevance to a base like validity)

    - identifying useful structures like 'graph spectrums to create graph fields to find overlaps with graphs of graphs and query bundles/manifolds' for identifying optimal graphs to solve a problem
        - for example, a 'variation/abstraction spectrum set' can be applied to 'graphs of graphs' to create a 'field of abstract graphs and specific graphs that also vary by variation' (like an 'abstract graph sheave') which are useful for 'queries about graphs to change graph variables to find an optimal graph for a problem', to apply the '2-d similarity/difference concept cluster network' to graphs, so that useful 'waves/queries between graphs representing different concept clusters' can be identified
            - this is similar to how identifying 'similar such as repeatable networks, that when repeated can add compounding value' (like 'grids of interface networks') are useful, similar to how a standard neural network repeats a 'change/filter graph', which is similar to 'repeating a generate/filter workflow to build interface queries'
        - relatedly, identifying and integrating different graph structures like 'graphs of graphs, graph manifolds/spectrums, and graph fields' is useful to integrate different interface structures like different change types of a graph, which are useful to identify connections/similarities/overlaps between so these structures can be trivially generated/identified
        - relatedly, 'graph bundles' are useful to identify useful query possibility/optimization structures like 'query manifolds on a graph'
        - relatedly, applying interface analysis inventions like these workflows as a 'dynamic graph of various concentric circle layers as indicating recently generated new concepts with different interactions, so that cross-layer interactions are useful at generating new variation, where useful structures are retained and completely used structures are compressed/replaced with new useful structures like a more comprehensive concept/network' is a good model to simulate my thought process, where the multiple interaction levels and the variants on each interaction level and the new recent structures to replace the previous structures add randomness/differences

    - identifying useful structures like 'concept network variants/usages' which identify other useful structures like a 'graph of concept networks' that is likely to be more useful than other graphs
        - for example, there is a 'concept network' for intents like 'identify another multi-functional number like pi/e' which identifies 'a network of "subsets of concepts" that are relevant to the reason for a definition of these numbers' (not every math concept/definition is equally relevant to why a number is useful, a subset of concepts is likely relevant for why these numbers are useful, so iterating other 'concept subsets' can identify other useful numbers), which means 'identifying a concept network for an intent' is a useful problem-solving intent, like identifying a concept network for 'maximum uniqueness filtering' like a 'network of overlapping concepts' is possible and useful to start solving the problem
            - this type of network would be useful to extend with 'connections to structures like types/similarities relevant to the concept subsets' to identify numbers like 'numbers with many types' or 'intersection numbers that are frequently between other useful numbers'
            - relatedly, other networks like 'networks of patterns/functions that determine/connect most useful numbers' are similarly possible to identify, which are useful for intents like 'identifying missing numbers/intents not already identified/fulfilled by the network'
        - similarly, a '2-d similarity/difference concept cluster network' is useful for identifying similarity/difference patterns in queries/intents, and a 'solution metric' concept network is useful for 'identifying similar concepts to solve/optimize for'
        - this involves 'identifying a possible similarity between concepts and the possible intents that similarity would be useful for' which can be pre-computed for most problems
        - this is useful bc there are some concept networks that are more useful than others, depending on their core similarities and how theyre used, which means 'identifying a concept network for a problem' is a high variation intent that is likely useful for 'filtering interface queries'
        - this is similar to how 'identifying a graph or graph structure for a query' is useful, but is specific to 'concept networks', given how many useful variants/usages there are of concept networks, which is a useful specific 'graph of graphs' to identify and optimize for interface queries
        - relatedly, base networks like 'validity or requirements' networks are a specific network on an interface (not the entire interface definition) which are useful in identifying similarities/differences to the base (like 'identifying similar structures to a validity network, as in valid structures')
        - relatedly, the 'lifecycle of a graph' is useful to identify patterns in, such as how a similarity/difference in a graph is useful until another more optimal similarity/difference structure like a 'pattern of variation' in the graph is identified/optimized to its limit, so identifying the 'similarities/differences possible in a graph', the 'similarities/differences defined/constant in a graph', the 'similarities/differences like patterns that are useful/optimal in a graph', can identify the potential of a graph across its initial/later usages/queries as well as identifying the 'more optimal usage/organization of a graph' that is usually identified later, which is useful to identify first to skip the suboptimal usages, as a way to filter interface queries to 'avoid suboptimal graphs/usages'
            - this will involve identifying problems that can identify the more optimal organizations/usages of a graph faster than other problems, so part of the query becomes 'identifying/generating a problem that can identify the more optimal graph usages/variants when the graph is used to solve that problem'
            - this involves reducing the search space for graphs, to identify the optimal points in a field that represent useful graphs at some similarity like a 'similar interval', which can be identified by 'identifying graphs that position known useful graphs at this similarity', which is similar to other problem-solving intents like 'identify solution/error positions' and 'identify a graph where solutions are equidistant or surrounded by errors or on the same side of a line' or 'identify a solution type network'
            - other variables can be integrated once these 'graph or solution similarities' are identified/applied, to apply other embedded variable subsets (different from the known relevant variables determining position on the graph) that can optimize the graphs
                - this applies 'graph dynamics' to identify for example how 'some defining connection on a graph will change, when additional variables are integrated', to for example 'start with a graph built from known similarities and increase the variation of a graph to identify the useful level of variation to find some unknown similarity like a pattern in queries'
            - relatedly, 'solutions grouped on one side of a line (above some ratio)' can be done by identifying solution patterns like how solutions are likely to be on one side of a line indicating some nontrivial complexity level, similar to how solutions are likely to be in the uncertainty space of the '2-d concept network', where its useful to start 'generating solutions from that position going outward'

    - identifying useful structures like 'query type variables' like 'alternative relevant interface structures (like opposites/limits/independent variables)' which can be used to derive different 'workflow/query types' when connected to problem-solving structures like 'solution metrics' and 'intents' (like 'identifying useful directions of change') (new query types like 'connect identified sequences that change useful variables like logic/truth')
        - regarding the usefulness of 'networks as bases', increasing variables like 'truth degree' can be done by applying a 'sequence of intensifying truth networks/filters (like possibility/probability/validity/complexity)', as opposed to 'connecting different opposing bases/limits to find some interim solution point/range', so a workflow can either 'connect differences like opposites (like problems/solutions)' or 'increase a solution metric like "truth ratio" with an identified increasing sequence'
            - relatedly, identifying sequences like 'increase the truth degree as much as possible by applying complementary truth filters, then connect to sequences of logical extensions of definitions' is useful as a type of default interface query, which 'connects identified sequences that change useful variables like logic/truth', similar to how 'identifying opposite bases/limits and connecting them to find some interim solution' is a type of default interface query, since there isnt always some clear opposite like a clear 'error/limit' to limit change in some direction or move away from (although other workflow types can be useful, like 'identify direction of useful concepts/structures/functions to identify useful change directions'), but there are other structures to move towards like 'general solution metrics' or 'independent variables'
        - relatedly, regarding workflows applying independent variables to identify connections between differences, identifying independent/maximally different variables as useful to make other variables more clearly similar (a connection/similarity can be made adjacent/trivial by an independent variable that acts like the base of a vertex, as in 'compared to this very different base, these now seem similar')
        - relatedly, 'abstract connections' are useful for basing various workflows on them ('connect similar problems/solutions and 'connect independent variables') and as a similarity/difference structure, similar to how 'high standards' are useful to base workflows on these structures (like 'connect/extend optimal points with each other and with suboptimal points, to increase their possibility' or 'identify uniqueness filters')
        - relatedly, its useful to identify irrelevant approximate signal variables like 'opacity' and the 'reason/ways these irrelevant variables can seem/be relevant' ('opacity' is usually not enough info to differentiate relevant structures, but occasionally it reflects some relevant variable like 'element identity', if the set of elements has already been filtered so that a relatively irrelevant variable can be useful at filtering), being too simple to contain info to reflect reality/relevance/meaning on their own

    - identifying useful structures like 'directions of independent variables' can align with intents like 'identify directions to fulfill a solution metric', where 'identifying the directions of independent variables' is possible bc these variables can be derived and their interactions derived as well, given that 'independent variables like interfaces determine other interactions (especially complicated/rare interactions) the most'
        - similar to how 'base optimal systems (where some ratio of solution metrics at some level of success are implemented)' are useful to start solving problems in, 'solution metric manifolds' or 'solution metric-implementing system manifolds' are useful to identify 'limits/positions/areas/averages of solution metric interactions/combinations'
            - relatedly, identifying all the 'valid interactions of interface/independent variables' is useful to 'identify possible optimal base systems that fulfill some solution metric structure', such as identifying 'systems where all independent variables can validly interact'
        - relatedly, how much a variable can change before an adjacent interface starts to be determining (how much 'function' can change before it requires a change in or starts to determine 'structure', given that function/structure are adjacent interfaces) is useful to identify 'areas of determination' and 'areas of uncertainty' between interface variables, given some graph specification like a 'specific set of core structures implementing these interface variables'
        - generating independent variables is another way to identify interfaces and connect variables to predict limits of an interface or when another interface will be determining
            - this means applying independence until the intersections of variables are predictable (applying independence structures like interface variables until some position where one interface determines/otherwise interacts with another is identifiable)
            - this means the problem of 'identifying which direction to apply changes in to fulfill a solution metric' would be solved, bc the 'independent variable intersections in that direction' would already be derived (involving identifying the set of independent variables, so that variables' directions can be identified based on which directions are already determined by another variable, and therefore the variables that cause structures like limits/intersections in a direction are identified, so these structures like limits/intersections can be derived, and given these limits/intersections, the right direction for a solution metric will be more trivial to identify)
        - relatedly, identifying solutions that are useful in some way like by 'identifying interface structures/variables, regardless of whether they succeed or not' ('if a solution fails, it still generates interface structures like relevant info such as info about error positions') is useful as a set of variables to generate 'solution metric descriptions that can be connected/extended to identify solutions'

    - identifying useful structures like 'reasons for usefulness' like how 'opposing base network pairs' are useful bc they can identify a 'solution range' (a 'set of opposing but relevant such as complementary structures' can identify other 'different but relevant' structures like 'upper/lower ranges' of solutions), so these 'reasons for usefulness' can be used to identify 'variants/extensions/structures' of that connection the reason is based on
        - relatedly, identifying 'perspective priorities' as indicating 'prioritized structures like prioritized origins/angles/sets/graphs/queries' as well as 'prioritized variables of the filter indicated/emerging from the perspective' is useful as a specific set of associated structures with perspectives that can 'change the relevance/usefulness of those perspectives'
        - differentiating ambiguously/subtly different related concepts like 'determining vs independent' is useful bc some variables can limit independence/determination like how "independent variables can depend on each other's definitions" and how 'there are other sources of power/determination than independence such as frequency', which I realized by thinking about 'building functions by classifying what a generated function is more useful for out of a complete set of core functions', then thinking about how 'independent variable connections' can be used to solve problems in general bc they are 'maximal difference connections' and that determining variables are similar in functionality to independent variables but importantly different, since other variables can determine independence, independence can be invalidated, and determining variables and independent variables interact with concepts like 'power' in different ways, and that these differences are useful in 'identifying new variation' and 'predicting rare/random errors' which are general problem-solving intents (both determining and independent variables are useful for 'predicting rare/random errors')
            - relatedly, identifying 'opposites/limits' is useful for identifying 'intersections', a primary determinant of relevance
            - relatedly, identifying 'rare/random errors/solutions' is useful as an example implementation of a useful 'base network pair' for solving problems, since the 'opposite (common/defined) errors/solutions' can be found by applying differences to the 'rare/random errors/solutions'
            - this is bc identifying an 'upper/lower solution range' (by identifying bases/starting points of change, directions of change, and limits on change) is relevant to problem-solving in general, and is determinable by identifying all the ways a connection can be true (generators) and all the ways a connection can be false (filters/limits) and their connections (averages/bases), which is related to the usefulness of 'identifying a solution and its differences/opposites (its errors, contradictions, limits)' in problem-solving
                - this (the 'relevance of a solution range', determined by what a solution is and isnt, as well as its starting points like 'absolute bases like an axis or a line or a subset of variables', generators/variables, bases/averages, filters/limits) is why a 'pair of base networks' is useful to connect, as being useful to identify when a structure is 'too similar or too different' from another structure like a solution/error to be a solution to a problem
                - relatedly, identifying when some structure is 'too independent/unconnected or undefined/ambiguous or emergently similar/different (from emergent structures like the next problem or a problem network) or too similar/different from known solutions/errors' is useful as a more general base than 'too similar/different from the original solution/error', which identifies alternate bases like cross-interface graphs to similarize to or differentiate a problem/solution structure from, which are still useful to find 'solution ranges' with
        - relatedly, identifying 'absolute/relative solution or solution metric limits' (limits on measurability, accuracy, computation, etc) is useful to identify 'variables/types of solution metric networks'
        - identifying similarities between 'workflows like generate/filter' and 'standard/base networks' is useful, like 'variable (generator) networks' and 'limit (solution metric) networks' which can be aligned to fulfill the workflow (query a 'sequence of variable/limit networks' to implement a 'generate/filter' workflow)
        - identifying similarities between perspectives and problems theyre useful for solving can help filter interface queries once a problem is broken into sub-problems, bc perspectives come with associated structures that filter out other structures
        - expanding this to the general variant, identifying 'spectrums/opposites/other variables' of a problem is an input to identifying the probable solution ranges on those 'spectrums/opposites/other variables' for that problem and identifying 'overlaps between solution ranges on different variables of a problem' is useful for identifying solutions to the problem

    - identifying useful structures like 'network sequences' and 'constant (requirement/definition)/variation (alternative)' structures like 'combinations/positions of constant/variation structures'
        - for example, identifying that solution similarities (in a solution type/description network) can have an 'overlap' with other networks like 'systems or system state sequences', so that a 'graph of solution types where useful solution types are adjacent' can be connected to a 'system allowing that solution graph to occur/overlap', at which point the problem can be solved by applying similarities to the problem system to make it 'similar to these optimal systems where optimal solution graphs can occur/overlap with the system'
            - this applies a 'required/defined/adjacent similarity' (between 'problem/system context' and 'solution/system context') as well as alternative/independent similarities like 'similarities connecting solution types in a solution type network' and 'overlaps/intersection similarities' between a system and a 'solution type network that can occur in that system or across system state networks', so that once the solution type similarities are identified, and connected to optimal systems allowing those solution graphs, they can be used to connect required similarities (between 'problem/system context' and 'solution/system context')
            - a general problem-solving intent can be derived from this example like 'apply required/defined similarities to structures to connect, then apply similarities like overlaps across optional graphs/networks (which add independence/variation which are therefore useful to connect)' (the problem/solution are required to have a system/context where they occur and the context is adjacent to these structures, they are not required to use or interact directly with a specific graph like a 'solution type network')
            - this is a useful example of identifying specifications that are required, like how 'applying the system interface' is different from this example of 'applying the system interface'

    - identify useful structures like 'common solution networks' which can be identified using 'overlaps of solution networks' like 'intent solution networks' (so that a type of solution like an 'easily verified' solution can be found in the same direction across networks, for example), without using just 'extensions/iterations/connections of definitions (like verification)' like 'concept network overlaps/intersections'
        - identifying 'solution network alignments' across 'specific solution networks for an intent like creating randomness' and 'solution type/metric networks (like nodes such as the simple/complex solution)' as a way of finding 'independent solution variables' (as opposed to defined solution variables, like identifying a solution to the problem of 'creating randomness' by applying differences like extensions/contradictions to definitions of other concepts) to create 'common solution networks' (where a solution type is in the same or a similar position across different solution networks, like solution networks for intents)
            - relatedly, solution type descriptions like 'difficult to find, easily verified' are useful for different intents and have variants like 'difficult to describe/generate, easily found' which are useful descriptions to define 'embedded solution metric values' (how a solution can be 'describable', 'easily describable', 'easily describable given some complexity in another relevant function', etc) which are requirements for some intent like 'obscurity'
            - relatedly, these different combinations are possible in cases for example where 'one comparison is trivial bc a similar structure already exists to make that comparison trivial' and that is the 'easily verified function', where the 'more difficult function requires iterating or other complexity structures', and identifying sets of functions which are 'similar but different to a relevant structure' (its output is similar to the verification function comparison/input, and the solution space is very different from the solution as in 'it has many possible solutions to iterate') is useful to identify structures that can resolve those differences as well as identifying variants of these structures like 'equivalently different sets compared to a relevant structure'
            - this is similar to how 'combinations of solution/error structures' like 'similar (true, defined, implied) but different (false, useless)' are more common and otherwise useful
            - relatedly, identifying ways to use structures like using 'combinations' of solution/error structures is useful (like how 'sets of suboptimal solutions' can still have useful functionality like when combined, they prevent a requirement/input for the problem by keeping that resource in use so it cant be used to create the problem, similar to how 'cycling suboptimal medicines can keep a pathogen too busy to be toxic, even though they cant completely remove it')
        - relatedly, identifying 'overlaps in solution networks like "solution networks for specific intents (like creating randomness)"' is useful for identifying multi-functional structures which can act like 'new bases for change'
        - relatedly, identifying how useful structures are often optimal in multiple ways is useful for identifying/generating them, such as how abstractions arent just useful for 'generality', theyre useful for 'storing info', which is not the intent of an abstraction but is a relevant output, given how an abstraction is defined and constructed
            - similarly, identifying how a structure is useful/useless like how a pattern can 'generate info, but not store a high ratio of info compared to other structures' or how a summary function can 'identify common/average values or simple connections but not reflect/store exactly accurate values' is a way to identify other structures that fulfill different combinations of metrics like functions that can 'change but not retain/store info'

    - identify useful structures like 'ratios/sequences' that can reference relevant structures like 'concept similarities' or 'base comparisons' that are useful across problems to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'identify/connect high variation variables'
        - 'ratios (to traverse of a set) that indicate base concepts like randomness' are useful to identify, similar to how 'sequences of concepts' are a useful way to derive other high variation similarities by 'identifying the first similarity to a concept on the sequence', to identify complexity by identifying randomness for example
        - as an example of a 'concept sequence', 'similarity-difference structures like ambiguities' or 'variables like positive/negative' could be positioned as an interim variable of the similarity/difference cluster network bc ambiguities can be 'ambiguous similarities where its non-trivial to differentiate them' or 'ambiguous differences where its non-trivial to similarize them'
            - as another example of a 'concept sequence', applying maximally independent variables to create required differences is useful bc 'solving for independence' solves for 'randomness', a similarly relevant base concept (that is useful to similarize to or differentiate from)
        - this means finding 'alignments between structures like ratios', where 'some ratio of a set is required to traverse' after which point some set of conceptual metrics like 'complexity/randomness' can be correctly identified, to find the 'high value ratios to traverse'
        - 'connections between workflows and bases that simplify/complicate them' like how 'randomness can be obscured by sorts initially on traversing a set and revealed later in the traversal, given that it makes equal distributions more obvious' and how randomness in a solution set makes trial and error more useful, so its useful to identify ratios indicating randomness and whether they apply to a set before selecting a workflow, or identify workflows that are useful across 'wider ranges of concept ratios'
            - this is useful bc once a set of solutions is identified, identifying whether this set is randomly distributed or otherwise fulfills conceptual metrics is useful for filtering workflows to apply
        - relatedly, 'filter error structures like uncertainties/ambiguities' is useful as an alternative to 'filter solutions' (if all the ambiguities indicating 'possible equivalences between different solutions' are identified and resolved, the solution will be obvious)
        - relatedly, 'base comparisons (comparisons between base concepts like interfaces such as truth/validity/randomness)' like how 'randomness is a quantification of entropy' are useful to connect high variation and are a default source of connections to use to filter queries

    - identify useful structures like the 'variables like specificity/volatility of bases like solution metric networks' that are relevant in filtering solutions/queries as well as 'solution metrics to identify graph optimizations'
        - for example, the volatility/specificity of a base like a solution metric network can be used to identify the position of variation/specificity to apply in a solution which can help filter solutions, like how some components of a solution are specific/volatile like 'constants' (as in 'configuration'), where this 'specificity' allows identifying similarities/differences from it (like the optimal positions of other variables of solution metrics, like the 'position of variation')
            - given the specificity of a subset of components/variables of the solution, this subset of specific metrics can be prioritized and connected to reduce the solution space, so that other required variables are more obvious or are formatted with required/allowed variation
        - relatedly, for example, many simple core workflows can be formatted as a wave connecting the '2-d similarity/difference clusters of concept networks', like how 'change a base solution' applies a similarity to one base (a different problem's solution) and a similarity to a different base (new solution metrics), where these can be connected as "similarity -> difference (as in apply a difference to the 'base that a similarity is applied to') -> similarity" which is a wave when formatted as a query of the 'similarity/difference cluster network', and same for workflows that involve sequences like 'filter/generate (specify/change)', so these 'query structures' can be used to filter queries based on similarity/difference to the required variation/specificity of the new problem/solution
            - meaning 'bc this similarity/difference cluster graph is available, and bc it allows variation like vacillation between and differences within clusters, useful queries can be created by vacillating between different points across clusters'
            - this is bc 'applying differences and checking for useful similarities in the difference' is a common useful intent, just like how 'applying differences like opposites to replace applying many similarities like incremental changes' is a common useful intent, which are useful intents for filtering queries
            - identifying the usefulness of other query structures like 'non-vacillations as in non-wave queries of this graph' will identify other graphs that are useful (like 'when is it useful to apply every different type like variation/abstraction in a sequence and what graph makes that sequence trivial/obvious/default/constant')
            - relatedly, identifying what variables are 'required/allowed to be constant/similar or variable/different' in a workflow/query is related to identifying 'allowed variation in a graph where that workflow/query is run', where these are independent variables that can coordinate or oppose each other, like how 'trial and error' or 'change a base solution' can be usefully applied to a 'graph of maximally different base solutions (known to be suboptimal)' to identify their useful 'positions/connections/variants' (that vary from a standard format that requires different similarities like a euclidean graph of polynomial solutions), since the base solutions capture a high ratio of variation/info and are a reduced set to iterate, as opposed to applying changes to one base solution, to optimize the graph for future queries while solving the original problem, to solve multiple problems at once ('identify the original solution' and 'change a solution graph to make that solution more obvious/trivial/constant'), where 'aligning the variation/abstraction/volatility/etc in graphs/workflows' is useful for 'optimizing both workflows/graphs/perspectives (angles/blurs/etc)'
            - relatedly, identifying 'where change structures like trivial/maximal changes are possible/useful' can change how useful an algorithm is (the usefulness of 'trial and error' can be changed by its sequence and by the size of the set of solutions, and similarly 'trivial changes' are only useful in best case scenarios that are unlikely, so trying 'multiple variants of trial and error with different sorts/sequences' opposes these errors that can decrease its usefulness) bc of 'gaps in graph organization' that make different solutions/errors equally probable/unfilterable/ambiguous (sequence can only determine the usefulness of 'trial and error' when solutions/errors are ambiguous, bc graphs lack the organization to differentiate these solutions, so 'ambiguities in solutions/errors' are a way to identify 'where variation can be applied in graphs to optimize them')
            - this is useful bc other 'pairs of network bases' are likely to be connectible with these query structures that are useful for this 'similarity/difference concept cluster network' (which is derivable with a 'check for an abstract similarity such as a type as in a type of pairs of networks, like other pairs of base networks, such as problem definition/solution metric networks')
            - these pairs of base networks are 'relevant/similar but different' in a useful way such as how solution components/variables/metrics are relevant but different so these are usable as base networks, where the point of these sets of base networks should be an integrated network that is optimized for queries, an integrated network that can be fit into another integrated network of networks, so 'identifying relevant/different bases' is a problem-solving intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'spectrum variable connections' like variables such as 'independence that connect general/specific variables' which are useful for identifying useful 'connections between a problem/solution' such as 'converting a general problem definition or general solution space into a specific solution', which can be solved by 'structures that increase interface variables (like specificity)'
        - for example, identifying the 'general causes' of a condition like cancer (chemicals, pathogen, damage, deficiencies, imbalances) involves identifying specific structures like 'indirect connections' such as that 'bacteria in one position (mouth) can cause bacteria in other positions (colon) bc they are indirectly connectible' to identify independent/indirect ways that a known general cause can specifically cause cancer (the way to 'specify the general cause' in a useful way is by specifying the 'type of causal sequence' to be identified as how that cause occurs, like 'indirect/independent connections', which has related info that helps specify it further, like 'identified indirect connections')
            - so 'identify general possible cause (like bacteria) -> identify specifying variable (independent/indirect causes) -> identifying known connections having that variable (independent/indirect connections like metabolic pathways) -> specific causal sequences (bacteria in one part of a connection can cause bacteria in another part of a connection)'
            - once a specific possible cause is identified, that specific cause is more testable and verifiable, which can help filter specific/general causes
            - other interface variables can connect general/specific structures, to find other interface-connections between a set of structures
        - relatedly, this is specifically relevant to connecting problem/solution structures which can be connected with specificity (the 'problem definition -> solution space -> solution workflow' involves 'increasing specificity', so adding specificity is an example of a 'workflow-implementing query')
            - identifying 'changes in interface variables' (like 'increasing specificity') of workflows is useful for identifying other workflows or queries to implement them, as well as identifying graphs where these 'changes in interface variables of workflows' are obvious (as in 'connect problem/solution, by increasing specificity, by applying independence')
            - this involves matching the variation (like the 'complexity' or 'ambiguity') in a problem with a variable that can create that variation (like 'independence')
            - the workflow/query: 'connect problem/solution, by increasing specificity, by applying independence'
            - involves identifying a connection between: 'complexity' -> 'independence' and 'independence' -> 'specificity', which are similar in variation (theyre all primary interface variables, so they have similar variation)
            - meaning in a 'complex problem system' (as in 'the solution is not a trivial combination of known solutions'), with a specificity-increasing workflow, 'independent connections' are useful in identifying solution 'causal sequence' connections
            - this means 'when a base (like the problem structure) has one interface variable (complexity) and its opposite base (like the workflow/solution structure) has another interface variable (specificity), a different interface variable (independence) that connects both of these variables can be useful in other problem-solving structures like the implementing query of a workflow that connects the problem/solution'
                - so within the space of possible solutions that are also valid, the 'independence' connection is one way to solve the problem by specifying independence structures until the solution set is reduced

    - identifying useful structures like 'cross-reality (independent variable) concept-based info traps/filters/connections' like how 'randomness makes stable info trivial to identify' which are useful for queries based on a specific interface like 'concepts', for identifying info/structures which are identified as relevant across workflows, like identifying 'stable info (as in true info)', especially where these connections involve independent variables, which are likelier than other connections to solve more problems, as well as identifying networks that implement these connections like a 'structure-similarity connection network' to identify network queries useful for identifying a 'conceptual/interface connection' (like a new connection or an improbable connection), where these similarities in the 'structure-similarity connection network' represent useful similarities like 'maximal difference-connections'
        - once you solve one problem like 'identifying non-adjacent routes between independent variables like interfaces', other things are solved like 'identifying improbable routes between independent variables like interfaces'
        - this is bc of the 'similarity in definition' between 'non-adjacent/indirect' and 'improbability', so an interface query to solve the problem of identifying improbable events could identify this similarity in definitions and identify the other to solve the improbability filter
        - this is like identifying a solution by identifying differences from its opposite (identifying what is not an error), or identifying the solution item in a set by identifying that all-but-one are incorrect, so it must be the last option
        - this involves specifying a structure that makes info obvious, like filtering a drastically reduced possible solution set so that additional filtering is trivial
        - by identifying similar concepts, the filtering is made trivial, bc the similarity of concepts adds a lot of structure/info/specification (like how identifying a type of a set adds a lot of info)
        - identifying these 'info traps/filters' (like conceptual/type similarities, compounding filters, uniqueness filters that leave one possible answer, etc) identifies these computational structures which can add specification/info to a problem
            - for example of a specific conceptual info trap, 'randomness' makes 'stable info' obvious, so identifying how other concepts/interface structures makes other info obvious is useful, as an 'obvious difference-identifying network function'
            - a way to derive this connection is to identify 'what is rarely true (random connections)' as being useful for identifying 'what is true', even though 'randomness' is independent of the 'standard truth definition', so 'identifying connections between independent concepts' is the primary intent
            - this can be integrated into a query component/function network (of nodes like 'filter/reduce/change') by identifying structures that can create randomness as useful for identifying the truth, so if a query parses to a possible randomness-creating sequence, it can be useful for identifying info (a 'sequence of switches' can produce randomness, so a 'sequence of switches' can be an info-identifying query)
            - integrating opposing cases (randomness may not make randomness obvious, when using the switch-sequence designed to identify true info, bc of the difference between 'truth and lack of randomness', as they are approximately equal, rather than equal) is useful in this query component/function network
        - 'a network of info traps and other info structures' is a useful network to apply when fulfilling intents related to 'identifying/differentiating info' (what trap can identify which differences, which are 'probably relevant' to the problem)
        - relatedly, identifying 'relevant sub-networks of interfaces' (like 'ratio values of a standard' networks such as 'improbability networks' in the probability interface) are useful to integrate into workflows (identifying 'how an improbable structure can create an error/solution' is useful for complete understanding of the problem system, in addition to the more common connections)
        - relatedly, identifying when identified errors might still contain useful differences for solutions (as different structures than error structures) or if its more useful to move towards a stable direction of optimality is useful to identify when a base network like an error network is not useful anymore (when its been 'stable as an error network', it can be assumed that there is no more useful variation in that network, and new errors are possible and need to be identified, if new interaction levels containing new errors are being used)
        - relatedly, identifying when 'structures intersect with relevance' (at what scale an iteration becomes relevant) is useful to identify a 'network of probably relevant structures, by connecting the bases of other interface structures and relevance definition networks', and similarly identifying 'pairs of networks to alternate variation between' (similarity/difference concept spectrum cluster networks, solution/error cluster networks, interface/relevant intersection networks, or pre-filtered central base networks like primary-base abstract node/secondary specification-embedding node networks) as well as identifying useful (such as independent, interactive, differentiating) queries on these 'network pair clusters' or 'intersecting networks' or 'base networks', as well as identifying the primary structure required for a useful network (matching intersection/bases/clusters as the useful network type for a query as a matter of identifying the difference/similarity made obvious like identifying 'maximal relevant differences' with 'concept clusters' and identifying 'maximal differences, then trivial similarities' like with 'networks of abstractions as centers/bases, surrounded by specifications'), to identify a query by 'identifying the specific networks that will make it trivial' (identifying info by identifying the specific networks that 'allow the variables of the info to vary enough that the relevant connections can exist and be differentiable from other allowed variation')
            - once this network of 'structure-similarity connection networks' is identified (and its 'meta-network connecting its useful variants or variables'), identifying networks for a query like 'identify a simple graph to identify new independent intents like security/stability, using these base networks' or 'identify a set of networks that will connect randomness/truth in a new way' will be trivial (identify the similarity structures like 'bases or clusters or intersections or grids' that would make connecting these concepts trivial bc of the useful similarities these structures represent, like similarities between 'equivalent alternates' or 'cross-interface structures' or 'useful variation' or other relevant structures)
            - then after connecting these useful similarities/differences with useful graph structures to represent/structure them like 'clusters/intersections/bases' (to identify a graph structure that is probably useful, based on the usefulness of its connections/similarities for problem-solving intents like 'connecting the problem/solution type/variables or other identified similarity'), connecting these useful similarities/differences (like 'maximal difference-connections' or 'equivalent alternates' or 'cross-interface structures' or 'useful variation') to problem-solving workflows/intents in a 'workflow/query component/function network' and a 'problem/solution network' is the last step to create an interface query-implementing network
            - the variation is in how these networks are implemented and integrated (is one network integrated with info on how it connects identified problems/solutions, with problems/solutions as 'outer nodes or emergent nodes on the network', or is the problem/solution network more useful as a separate network)
        - relatedly, identifying how the workflows interact with each other is useful for identifying similarities/differences to identify new workflows, like how 'divide and conquer' is related to 'trial and error' by 'filtering a set and by handling subsets', and how 'trial and error' is related to 'change a base solution' by 'using a solution set', and how 'divide and conquer' can be used to implement 'trial and error' by identifying 'maximally different or other highly filtering solutions in the set'

    - identifying useful structures like 'similarities in a difference' which can connect different relevant structures like how nodes in a connection sequence like a state sequence are both similar and different from other nodes in a relevant way, so structures like a 'similarity in a difference (symmetries)' are useful to apply to relevantly connect different structures (as opposed to simply 'applying similarities' or 'applying variables' without considering that it needs to both be different from the error/problem and be similar to the solution, since those structures are applied as multiple bases/standards to implement a workflow function like 'connect' to solve a problem)
        - for example, each step in a sequence that connects a problem/solution can be a 'relevant difference (from the previous state) and a relevant similarity (to the next state)' which can take the form of a 'relevant difference (from the problem state/definition/variables) and a relevant similarity (to the solution state/metrics/variables)'
        - for example, a 'similarity to an original solution and a difference specific to the new problem or a difference useful for increasing validity' (like the workflow 'change a base solution') is a relevant similarity/difference structure using a 'problem/original solution' or 'original solution/validity' base network pair, where the similarity/difference are relevant to each other by both applying to the solution, and where the 'difference in the original/new problem' can be used to identify the position of required difference in the solution, given that the solution reflects a similarity to the problem
            - each possible similarity/difference pair isnt required to be relevant, but it is useful when they are relevant, especially in connecting a set of relevant bases
        - relatedly, a graph of 'grids of variable spectrums' is a useful alternative to a 'network graph of variables' in that it allows different values within standards/variables to interact and their useful interactions prioritized with 'different sequences of variable spectrums' as 'grid lines'

    - identifying useful structures like 'similarities to base iterated graphs on (like graphs of graphs of graphs)' such as 'problem type filters'
        - for example, the 'graph of graphs of graphs' can be organized by a starting function like 'identify problem type' from an origin entry point of the graph, after which each 'graph of graphs' is optimized for a different problem type, having different workflows implementing different functions relevant to solving that problem type, where the networks organized to solve a problem type are positioned/sequenced/structured in a way that makes the required comparisons for solving that problem trivial using 'standardization/alignment/other similarities across these networks', which applies connections like 'filtering/identifying is comparing'
            - similarly, filtering base networks to identify the 'level/type/structure of variation required to solve a problem type' to select the subsets of those base networks like 'validity networks' relevant to solve a problem type is useful as another filter
            - this is a problem of identifying graph embeddings/connections that will work as bases for interface queries bc of their variability/similarities, such as how problem type is a 'high variation variable', so sorting/filtering 'graph embedding sequences' by info/variation content (like interfaces, independent variables, problem type) is a useful example function to organize these graphs, so that interface queries can be identified by 'definitions relevant to this graph of graphs of graphs', like a useful query will 'start at the origin and make it to at least n steps on one of these graphs of graphs'
            - 'networks that connect specific differences' can be used for queries that only require those 'identified and supported differences', but not queries that dont use those differences, which can be supported with other differences like 'differences not yet identified as useful', similar to how randomness 'identifies useful changes or adds info when probabilities are basically equivalent by being undetectable/unidentified'
        - alternate graphs to compare/connect include connecting networks of 'everything to everything' (using a set of LLMs as the base networks to connect)
        - relatedly, 'finding best possible functions using base networks like requirements and reality' is possible by identifying functions with general usefulness such as the 'optimal function' (as in 'it would be better if this function was implemented in this way for multi-functionality, so check for that function in case it exists in a system') for intents like 'trying to fit those functions to input variable systems to identify whether the system can be trivially changed to implement these optimal functions'
        - relatedly, 'relative references' have high info content about comparisons, like how 'best/worst/average' references indicate info about the other items in the set, like a 'type' or 'limit' or 'opposite type' does, which are useful in cases like 'when one of the relative references is more computable than the others, so that reference can be prioritized' and for intents like 'identify the probable position of a solution, using its difference/distance from a reference position', and which are useful as 'pre-computed/pre-solved comparisons', so that when a comparative reference like the 'average' case is identified, that can be prioritized to build queries/solutions around that pre-solved comparison, given the info it contains
        - relatedly, identifying 'potential networks' to identify the limits of definitions/requirements/interactions of 'what is possible for a structure to become' is useful for simulating reality, to find the 'interactions of the limits of potential on structures', rather than 'describing identified functions with trivial variation', in order to implement a 'reality search engine' that can fulfill reality queries like 'identify all the habitable planets' (without information about all planets, but with derivation rules that allow predicting where they'll be), where the 'reality search engine' functions similarly to a 'virtual set of satellites to gather info about the universe'
        - relatedly, identifying 'interface-structure' cross-interface structures (combining structures like 'computers/chargers/lasers/magnets/stars/orbits' with concepts like 'power/balance/truth' or other interface structures like 'perspectives/priorities' to identify 'balance chargers' or 'perspective/variation magnets' or 'meaning computers' or 'filter lasers') are useful as a way to identify new useful cross-interface intents to implement

    - identify useful structures like 'new networks of useful structures to connect (solution/error metrics, interface structures of solution/error structures, irrelevant solution/error interactions)' and 'new connections between them (embeddings, variants, interface graphs, iterated graphs, graph variation queries)'
        - for example, connecting specific solution/error networks with interface graphs is useful to identify overlaps/connections/similarities between 'errors (negative structures) of solution metrics (like when a solution is not reusable for being too specific)' and 'solutions (positive structures) of error metrics (like when an error is easily fixed, or when an error is a structure of a solution, like when a tradeoff still has errors at the optimal point so its not an error but a requirement)', as well as identifying 'irrelevant interactions between errors/solutions (like when an error/negative about a solution is irrelevant)', "connections between an error network, solution network, and interface structures like 'iterations' of them that are useful" (like 'iterated embeddings' like 'missing info of missing info' which creates negative incentives that lead to other errors, since its useful to use this error to obscure errors), and 'connections between error/solution metric networks' as well as 'connections between error/solution metric networks and other high variation networks' like 'iterated graph networks' ('graphs of graphs of graphs'), since interface structures are mostly useful for connection solutions/errors, which have specific useful networks, these 'overlaps/connections/similarities' across these networks emerging from the graphs and replacing the graphs as 'core similarities across graphs' once identified
            - these 'overlaps between solutions/errors across solution/error networks' form a useful network to store, to identify 'uncertainty areas for matching new variation', 'useful starting points/variables for creating both errors/solutions', 'directions of solution/errors', and which 'stores error info in case its useful for some problem' (as opposed to 'compressing errors to a point/network')
            - the variation in 'graphs that integrate/differentiate different solutions/errors' is another useful graph network (similar to how a system manifold is useful as a starting point for identifying a system variant where solutions/errors are isolated by default)
            - relatedly, the possibility of integrating solution/error networks is a useful general intent, so that 'identifying new solution/error networks' is a useful way to 'identify new variation', once previous solutions/errors are connected
        - relatedly, matching 'variation of causes of errors' with 'variation of indications/outputs of errors' is an example of a symmetry that can be used to identify errors (when there is still high variation in requirements for errors like 'requirements for crimes', there will still be high variation in indications of errors like 'non-criminal functions not being fulfilled optimally', which is useful to identify the position/type of variation in causes for errors like requirements, so 'identifying the position/area/structure of variation (or iterated structures like "useful allowed possible variation in some graph") in nodes in a symmetry sequence/network' is a useful problem-solving intent, bc once the 'position/structure of variation in one node' is known, it can be applied/identified in other nodes which may allow solving the problem more optimally, and the 'correct node to apply the variation to/in' can be more easily identified once these symmetry sequences are identified, to enable queries like 'format the variation in "a network of networks that allows n-degree complexity in connections" to solve this problem, bc of this similarity to complexity in the problem variation visible in the first node network')

    - identify useful structures like variables of specifications of true connections like 'relevance as variables of truth (relevance can change truth)' and patterns of differences in useful queries/connections like how 'networks/similarities/standards/independent variables/frequencies' are high variation variables (as in interfaces) and useful variants of useful structures like 'problem networks as difference-allowing networks'
        - identifying 'relevant differences to compare' like how the "metadata of a point and its counterpoint (like size)" is relevant to compare (is a point more generally true, true in more cases, more true, etc than its counterpoint), just like comparing a connection to its trivial variants is useful (to check for differences that are volatile in that they can change a solution to an error with trivial change)
            - this means identifying the variables of 'comparison structures (like a counterpoint or trivial variant) as relevant to compare to a point' as possible to filter to identify comparison structures in general (like validity networks, trivial variants, averages, opposites, iterations, etc), without knowing the useful structure to compare to (identifying 'what to compare in an interface query' as a way to specify the interface query)
        - identifying cross-interface structures like cross-interface conditions like 'if x is relevant, then a = b is true' bc truth of a variable connection can change to some ratio according to priorities (relevant structures), such as 'if there is a requirement for a connection (if the connection is important/relevant), it will become true', or 'if trivial changes are always/frequently applied (as in relevant), then trivial variants of structures are true'
            - this is useful to identify 'truths with other priorities/relevance' (and specific variants like 'truths with all priorities') since relevance can change the truth
        - relatedly, identifying 'connecting problems to identify solutions in between problems' as a workflow is a trivial variant of other problem-solving intents like 'connect solutions to identify variables of solutions' or 'differentiate from errors to create solutions' or 'connect solutions/problems to identify differences that can create a solution from a problem', which combines/varies these problem-solving intents, since the 'position of problems/solutions on most graphs' is likely to be different across types, where solutions/problems are distributed/mixed rather than isolated
        - identifying 'similarities to identify averages/overlaps/differences of standard/base networks' is useful to 'reduce comparisons of complex structures like graphs/networks to a ratio/scalar value', like how identifying 'overlaps/differences of optimized networks and system networks' is useful to identify 'values of required position corrections' ('values' being a ratio compared to some reference value like 'zero' or 'unit' or 'average' or 'many' or 'all'), reducing the problem to 'align the problem system network with some other network or set of networks (like a solution metric network or concept network) so that their differences are easily identified as being some value (in a set/spectrum of values)' which is a useful specification of 'identify similarities between standards such as networks (like average problem system networks as in average difference-allowing networks)', which is similar to 'identify the limits/structures of a problem system network as a way of identifying its position relative to other networks/graphs', like how solving a problem optimally can be a matter of 'identifying the value of a change in position on a graph of graphs' such as 'identifying when one of the standard graphs needs to be optimized for some solution metric it doesnt currently fulfill'
            - identifying the 'network-generating similarities that allow differences considered errors' as in 'problem system networks' such as a 'graph of a system that allows structural errors to accumulate in components by not enforcing a similarity between optimal/required and actual interactions' or a 'graph of a system that fulfills a random set of solution metrics and has a random selection of errors, as its used to fulfill other metrics than those its optimized for' is a useful specification to apply and connect to other networks (like solution metric networks, solution networks, problem networks, problem/solution connection networks, standard networks, concept networks, etc), to identify useful connections of the 'problem-generating graphs' (which can be made useful by abstracting them to connect them more adjacently to abstract solution metrics) to other graphs (like the 'abstract/specification graph which connects abstractions to useful specific structures like matrices', to identify when these useful specific structures will resolve some difference in a problem-generating similarity-based graph) to identify the 'similarities that create problems when applied as a systemic base or generator' and how to connect these problem-generating similarities to other useful networks
        - relatedly, the 'most info that a value can contain' reflects the variables that can be standardized to a scalar difference, which could reflect 'a difference in a system variable (like volatility) between complex systems (like math fields)', and also can reflect the 'one value that makes a system useful as in "makes a system work" or "makes common differences (like rotations) trivial to connect (like e/pi)"'
            - 'once a value is identified as useful in a system such as in making the system work or in connecting systems, what does that mean for other alternates/variables/systems' (as in 'is it a coincidence that it worked, resulting from indirect variables') is a useful question to answer to identify these 'highly useful variables/specifications' when its identified that there is likely 'missing info, like missing variants' (in a number set, there are 'units of multiple change types' allowed by that number set), so 'when there is an incomplete set of these known defined/required units' is a useful case to apply that query to 'check if a value is useful across problems', if the other units cant be adjacently changed/iterated to solve most problems (as in 'check if a solution solves other known problems once found and once its identified that it wasnt a random coincidence and if there are known problems with an identifiable similarity to the problem/solution')

    - identify useful structures like new useful unresolved differences in maximally standardized structures like the 'useful graph network' (in which variables like relevance, layer, base, sequence, position, definition, independence, repeatability, usage, structure, similarity, abstraction, etc havent been resolved in their optimal implementations in this graph network)
        - for example, different graphs (like 'concept definition networks (where nodes are queried to form definitions of concepts)', 'concept definition structure networks (where definitions are implemented as "network structures" rather than "node queries", which are positioned as nodes in the definition network, like how volatility can be defined as an interim function compared to linear/random functions)', 'similarity networks of variables/functions/structures that are similar by some variable', 'networks with repeatable concept definition structures like "volatility structures" to find useful usages/queries of these concepts (since volatility is frequently encountered/useful in real systems, applying it as a grid or other repeated structure in a network is probably useful to start with to identify the most useful variants of this network)', 'networks with unique concept positions to find useful connections between these concepts') are all graphs with different value which can be integrated in useful ways (like layering graphs such as "similarity networks of variables" and "unique node networks" to identify the "unique nodes connectible with those similarities", according to the original or new similarity connections of the similarity network, or layering graphs like grids of different concepts like volatility to identify their most useful repeated interactions, or connecting useful graphs with the graphs of complex systems that create intents that benefit from those graphs, or 'creating query indexes on specific graphs like the concept network which are useful to standardize to and which can be implemented in a way that contains the variation of complex systems having the same concept query, indexes that can identify useful query patterns like the queries that create the most stable systems') to identify new useful graphs composed of these base graphs
        - fulfilling related problem-solving intents like 'identifying the position of uncertainty' applied to this 'useful graph set' takes the form of "identifying the graphs whose value is unique (hasnt yet been 'repeated/exceeded in an alternative structure') and resolving their optimal interactions in a graph network or graph usage network"
        - relatedly, identifying what variables can be irrelevant in a graph in some way and still be useful in another way is useful (such as equal connection length being useful to indicate any connection at all when connection existence is still being resolved, after which more variables can be embedded on those connections like varying connection length once a connection's existence has been established as a fact to base changes on, where the exact connection length is irrelevant at that state until connections are established), where identifying these 'relevance sequences' such as 'sequences indicating how a structure can become more/less relevant' are useful to identify when solving problems related to optimizing graphs and their variables like their relevance

    - identify useful structures like 'graph-generating functions' such as 'connect a source graph to an interim unconnected concept like interface variables like "power/density/probability" that is relevant/similar in some interface variable like "cause" to the current graph sequence and relevant/similar to some interface variable like "variation" to the target graph to be connected to' (as in 'connect a source graph to power by cause, in a way that increases variation in the graph, to be similar to the more complex/higher variation target graph, given that a "causal sequence" and a "power increase" are theorized to be an area that possibly contains the solution, so that these structures like "causal sequence" and "power increase" are overlapping', as a way of connecting identified problem/solution structures) or 'identify adjacent unconnected concepts that havent been connected yet' (as a way of identifying useful directions to apply changes in, to connect it to variants that are probably useful but not identified to be interim structures between a problem/solution), which are useful for generating graph structures like 'graph sequences' to be used in graph queries like 'identify a simplifying graph to connect these graphs of systems'
        - for example, 'graph manifold indexes' are useful for identifying when a complete rule set requires only 'positional variation or other trivial variation' to identify the correct variant (such as to identify which interactions of a complete node set or which positions given some complete function set are correct, when its known that some set is complete), which is useful when the 'variants of a graph' can be connected to a 'relevant/useful structure, like a testable/measurable/identifiable variant, like a specification of the graph'
            - similarly, 'graph subset indexes' are useful for identifying when a set has an error structure of 'incompleteness' and completing the set (a known set of rules/positions/nodes fits into another graph which makes the other graph a possible solution to complete the set), which is useful for identifying missing connections or correct variants in systems like physics/math
            - similarly, 'required/constant/certain vs possible/variable/uncertain similarities' are useful for identifying graph causality (the 'resulting/emergent' similarities resulting from a graph's 'required' similarities are a useful index to identify), which is identifying a 'probable solution range' indicating the 'position of the variation/uncertainty', given identified info, and identifying a 'graph/graph set/graph manifold that is allowed to vary in that range'
            - for example, in a 'network graph where nodes are allowed to be non-equidistant', types of similarities such as 'clusters' can occur, so a graph like this is probably useful for identifying 'powerful/important nodes in the set', assuming sufficient data, and 'nodes that vary in power/importance', and "variables describing nodes/connections/positions that reflect the info of the nodes' power/importance"
            - by comparison, other graphs might 'standardize away' the info of the power of each node by removing that info in some process that applies filters/similarities, so identifying these as 'error graphs to avoid' is useful to apply changes to these base error graphs
            - structures like 'adjacent unconnected' variables are useful to connect to bc they are 'similar but different' structures and therefore also relevant in some way
            - this doesnt mean just 'apply power to a graph, if power hasnt been connected to it yet' but also 'identify interface structures like concepts between graphs and concepts adjacent to graphs that could be useful in connecting the graph to other graphs', so that the 'next useful variable to apply to increase the usefulness/variation/uncertainty of a graph' or a 'useful variable to connect relevant systems' can always be identified
            - for example, this can take the form of applying graph variable similarities to identify useful change directions, such as where a graph of variation might identify another useful variant when the variation is replaced with complexity, which will keep the graph similar but different in various ways such as having a different area
        - this is useful for identifying 'graph topologies' to fulfill intents like 'identify which direction/position on the graph topology to apply changes in to find a probably useful graph for identifying whether this specific connection is common, given the similarities possible/probable vs. required in that direction/position'
        - identifying 'graph-connecting queries' is useful to identify probably useful interface sequences like 'concept sequences' to apply to connect graphs, such as identifying when 'quantizing/specifying/simplifying a graph' or 'connecting a graph to the concept of probability' is likely to be a useful connection on the way to other graphs like other complex systems (such as 'when a graph hasnt been connected to an interface like probability yet' or 'when a very low ratio of similarities emerging from a non-random graph have been identified')
            - this solves the problem of 'when there is no clear structure of a solution like "direction to/position of a solution", identifying specific changes like "specific concepts to connect to like unconnected concepts" that will make a solution structure like a "solution direction" more obvious', for cases like 'when the connections between interfaces like info/math havent been identified yet, where its identified that they are definitely connected and the variation is in the specific connections', which can be solved with graph queries on graph structures like graph sequences created by these graph-generating functions
        - relatedly, 'identifying a base solution' is a way of 'identifying a solution area', which is a useful connection between problem-solving intents, similar to how 'identify useful directions to apply changes in' identifies a 'probable solution direction/position'
        - a related problem to solve is identifying 'which graphs (of what variation/complexity/differences/similarities) should be connected or otherwise used as inputs to these workflows' like 'identify useful directions to apply changes in'
        - relatedly, identifying 'when the limits of variation/specificity/variables in a concept/structure have been reached' is useful as a way to limit change in that direction when identifying new concepts/structures, since many concepts/structures overlap in what they describe (like combinations/sequences) but there is a limit to how much a concept can or should describe (at which point a new system might be necessary, rather than a new standard/concept to describe a new similarity/interface type)

    - identify useful structures like 'connections between similarities, by a variable that identifies other variables which can connect similarities'
        - for example, a 'similarity spectrum on variation (or variable dimension)' can contain structures like 'ratio (similarity to a standard/threshold value), similarity to an opposite of a structure (useful when fitting structures), similarity to a base (compared to a similar solution), similarity to variables in general (comparison to everything, as in an interface)', which has variants in the interface structures determining the metadata (variable count) of the similarity graph (spectrum)
        - relatedly, identifying when a 'structure related to a set, like a structure that interacts with a set in a useful way (like a substance that treats multiple conditions)' is connectible to other useful structures like 'sequences such as causal sequences (like how a substance that treats multiple conditions could indicate related conditions in a causal sequence)' is useful to identify useful structures like 'cross interface such as structure-function connections' ('interactive substances' can be used to identify 'causal sequences of conditions')
        - relatedly, multi-functional structures can be used in similar ways to interfaces or abstract concepts in that a problem can be solved using one multi-functional structure if it contains enough variation, which are more useful with fewer requirements like 'multi-functionality of a structure, without modification (change)', which are useful as solution metrics to implement by specifying to identify solutions

    - identify useful structures like 'graph manifolds/spectrums/variables' which are useful for identifying optimizations that increase relevance of the structure like 'adding similarities in low-relevance variables like position' to identify other useful structures like 'generally relevant graphs like average graphs'
        - for example, a typical network graph has 'relevant sets/connections' but 'irrelevant position (except to differentiate the nodes)', so 'increasing the relevance of position in a network graph' is possible by applying similarities to connected items so that 'highly connected subsets are positioned in a cluster' to indicate the similarities embedded in the connections and/or to remove those similarities once identified to identify the remaining similarities
        - relatedly, a graph has 'specific definitions of similarity/connectivity, specific sets, and specific limits' that are useful to find overlaps with, to identify a 'general graph that is the same or approximately the same for various specifications', in the manifold of trivial variants of the graph, these general graphs being useful as 'base graphs'
        - relatedly, graph structures like 'graph manifolds', 'graph matrixes', 'graph spectrums' are useful structures to identify as being multi-functional or otherwise useful graphs that can be applied as 'base graphs' for identifying useful variants like useful specifications
        - similarly, identifying 'manifolds of all of the manifolds of a graph' (and useful structures like similarities/intersections of these manifolds of the manifolds of a graph) by varying 'generative/descriptive/input/component variables of the graph' is similarly useful for similar intents like identifying 'average/general graphs'
        - relatedly, identifying the structures like 'sets/connections/positions or connections/intersections (which form network graphs)' that are most useful to combine to enable comparisons (such as how its useful to compare a 'graph to its manifold of variants of it, specifically averages of it and general variants of it' and to compare a 'graph to a grid or other standardized structure with a different definition of difference, but a similarity in relevance of coverage area' are useful to identify, such as cross-interface structures and similarity-difference cross-interface structures (like different formats in a similar structure like an area) and other embedded relevance cross-interface structures
        - this applies variation in the 'system/context' side as opposed to only the 'function/connection' side of the context/function vertex where problem-solving usually occurs, which is useful for identifying other useful intents like changing context to more optimal contexts or identifying the strictest context to solve problems in, and is useful in general for robust cross-context solutions, and accounts for the probability of context change during/after problem-solving occurs

    - identify useful structures like 'relevance-graph indexes and relevance-graph set indexes and relevance-graph function/variable indexes' which can apply structure to general intents like 'identify relevance'
        - for example, the 'ratio of graphs that are similar (identifying the same connection as true), once graphs are standardized to have equivalent relevance', the 'function to identify relevant graphs to apply queries/comparisons in', the 'integration of graphs to assign relevance by a structure like weight to each graph', and the 'similarities required to enable connections between graphs, like the function to create graphs that represent units of relevance so that functions like "adding graphs to add relevance" are possible' are all useful structures to fulfill general problem-solving intents like 'filter interface queries', since 'identifying the set of graphs that can confirm/contradict a connection' is a general problem-solving intent, and the other structures are useful structures to solve problems once that intent is applied as a primary intent of a workflow
            - for example, identifying if a set of structures 'overlap on most variable values' and also 'dont overlap with/are distant from the same sets' is a useful set of comparisons to apply, once the graphs are known that would make those overlaps/distances clear
            - this is related to identifying two bases such as 'extremes/opposites' to apply as a 'limit/range' to identify some point in between that balances them correctly, but instead identifies a reference point/base (of 'sets to be similar to/different from') to connect the ambiguous structures to in order to compare them across different metrics (which identifies multiple ranges, which are useful to identify overlapping areas of these ranges)
            - this is related to the problem of 'already identifying whether info has a structure like a similarity, before it can be graphed a specific way to indicate/magnify that similarity' - 'whether to identify the graphs first or to identify the similarities to use to build the graphs (without introducing errors like bias)' is a useful question to resolve
            - this identifies 'similar to and different from' as a common useful specific structure of solutions (most solutions are useful by being similar to something and different from something else), which identifies various structures of interface variables like 'similar in volatility to x and different in abstraction to y' as useful possible solution structures (similar to how 'generally true and specifically false' is useful as a truth structure to apply as a solution structure), similar to how the query sequence 'how could it be true' and 'how could it not be true' are often found 'when an interface is crossed (a new base variable is identified)', so identifying these specific structures that are 'useful across queries as query/solution structures, given some case' is useful
            - this is useful bc identifying a 'graph that indicates something is similar to x' and a 'graph that indicates something is different from y' is a default query applying this structure of 'bases to differentiate from' using specific structures like 'graphs that are likely or defined to indicate/magnify that similarity/difference'
            - relatedly, inputs of problem structures like 'conflicts' such as 'direction changes' (so that previously aligned structures become conflicting in direction) or 'direction changes in similarities' (like 'direction changes in incentives' leading to 'conflicting directions in related/similar/input variables to incentives, like intents/actions') are useful to identify
                - relatedly, for an example regarding resolving a conflicting direction, a 'graph to apply direction as an indication of opposition' is useful as well as a 'graph to indicate similarities/overlaps between intents/incentives of opposing structures to apply these similarities as sources of conflict' and a 'graph to indicate similarities in other structures like functions to identify ways to use opposing functions to implement common intents as sources of compromise points' are useful, and even more useful to connect/integrate, so that a change toward compromise points changes conflicting directions to be more aligned, which is why identifying 'connections/integrations of graphs' and the related intents fulfilled by these graphs are useful to identify
            - relatedly, 'iterated filters, until useful limits like overlaps/similarities are reached', like 'iterated maximal differences (like maximal differences such as "independent variables or types", then maximal differences of those like intra-type variants, then iterated all the way to similarities like 'overlaps of maximal differences within types identified as maximally different' since similarities imply a useful ratio of coverage of the solution space, when iterations from different bases/types start overlapping, etc)' are a useful implementation of this structure like 'similar to x and different from y' or a 'simple similarity/difference combination' that are likely to be useful in a query
            - relatedly, identifying that there is a 'general error that is similar to other errors' is useful to apply 'specifications/differences' to identify the 'specific variant of the general error and the unique variables/components/inputs of the similar error', where the structures that resolve a 'general difference/error' can be specified to a useful degree, which is usable as a general problem-solving intent
        - this reduces the problem of 'identifying/proving a variable connection' to identifying useful graphs that could indicate useful similarities (so identifying a relevant graph is a matter of 'identifying what would be useful if it was true/similar' and 'identifying a structure where those useful structures are true/similar')
        - relatedly, other relevance structures exist which can be applied in place of other useful structures like 'averages/weights/ratios' to standardize relevance, such as a 'network of weights per connection' to identify different weights for different cases of the other weights or variables of structures being weighted
        - relatedly, 'probable adjacent possibilities/alternatives' can be applied as 'alternate realities or timelines' or 'inputs to create time' when the probabilities arent completely resolved, creating a 'balance/overlap between timelines' as 'connecting multiple realities at once'
        - relatedly, the 'reality of solutions' is a useful metric (as in the 'distributedness, permanence, stability, reusability, commonness, variability, etc' of a solution) which references the 'real solution' compared to a cheaper/less effective/temporary/etc fix as a 'more real as in relevant alternative', which is not always possible/useful to find, since a temporary fix is useful in systems that are about to be reformatted/standardized/otherwise systematically changed, so applying these as general solution metrics will be useful in general and specifically when a problem's solution definition is lacking information
        - relatedly, a 'relevance cluster' is useful as 'another base to connect other bases/clusters to', to identify useful similarities/differences between the constant/variation clusters and relevance clusters, given that 'relevance occurs through the interactions of the constant/variation clusters, so its likely to be useful to connect to relevance definitions', where a 'graph connecting definitions of relevance like distributedness with definitions of other interface structures' and a 'graph of connections of specific variants/examples of these structures in a relevant context' and a 'graph of variation-based (and other interface variable-based) similarity between these clusters' are useful graphs to integrate/connect with similarities/causes/usage structures to identify pre-computed interface query components like 'using other graphs than the definition graph when a definition is clearly incomplete or changing'

    - identify useful structures like 'meta-meaning as in the meaning of meaning' which enable other structures like 'useful interactions to optimize for' bc meta-meaning is a 'useful base to standardize to' (like computing the 'meaning across different graphs' like different similarity index networks) and is particularly useful for some overlapping set of problem-solving intents like 'solving root causes' and 'changing/optimizing for critical points/thresholds/ratios', given that the meaning can be computed until an 'intersection with a useful structure like a useful ratio to optimize for' occurs (interactivity being a variant of meaning, so 'identify meta-meaning until other forms of meaning are crossed/found, then implement the specific connection to that other form of meaning or otherwise optimize for the other form of meaning')
        - identifying the ultimate meta-meaning (as in the 'net/emergent/scaled interaction') of meaning (like how 'predators are often former victims' is a 'meaning' of 'crime') like the "1% of blame for innocent people" or the "1% of self control that would have changed most predators" or the "1% that innocent people didnt do" or the "n-variables of virtue that are required for a good society" (as in, 'its not enough to be good in one way, multiple ways are required, then a good society can exist and be stable/stronger than other societal states') is useful as a way to identify useful interactions to optimize for, which doesnt just identify 'sequential/direct/adjacent meaning' ('predators are often former victims') but also absolute meaning of the meaning (the 'meaning of the interpretation', as in the 'interpretation at scale'), until it intersects with a useful interaction like a useful ratio to optimize for, starting from 'meta-meaning' as a base
        - the metadata of these meaning/relevance queries can be determined as well froo these identified useful queries ('how many meaning levels/degrees are usually computed before a useful ratio is identified')
        - relatedly, the structures that enable useful workflows like 'alternate between extremes' and 'vary a connection between clusters' includes the 'set of cluster variables (like clusters like constant/specification vs. variation/abstraction) which fulfills both of those workflows and probably others as well, such as 'connect maximal differences to connect other less independent/abstract differences'
        - relatedly, the cluster concept network is useful for other intents like how the 'similarity between generality/specificity' implies that 'all general structures would be specifically true as well', which its useful to find differences/contradictions of like 'generally true and specifically false' (cross-truth/abstraction interface), which are useful to find 'additionally layered cross-interface variants of' in addition to finding intra-spectrum variants of and unitary cross-interface variants of, like additionally layered cross-interface connections like 'specifically relevant and generally false' (cross-relevance/truth/abstraction interface), where the more layers exist, the likelier it is that these connections will be useful for interface query components or interface queries (as theyll connect more independent/maximal differences the more interfaces are added)
        - relatedly, abstract similarities are meaning structures bc the abstraction/generality adds interactivity through adding scale, which identifies other 'connections between meaning and other interface structures'
        - relatedly, 'using existing info' is related to workflows like 'change a base solution' and to interface structures like 'patterns', which identifies ways to connect info structures to identify other structures
        - relatedly, identifying that sometimes a variable is useful to apply in different ways like 'before/after' is useful to identify optimizations to neural networks like applying copies of these variables at different positions that allow these different usages like 'before/after another variable', which is not a default occurrence in a directed network (the algorithm wont necessarily identify that a variable should have space/nodes for these before/after interactions around it and apply that insight or identify that the sequences should optimally have an overlap at the variable that is used multiple times, where space/nodes that allow for these and other interactions should be a default so these multi-usage nodes can be applied in the correct structure, and a normal algorithm might incorrectly position a variable at the edge of a network when it requires more nodes to identify other variants of its interactions)

    - identify useful structures like 'bases for interface queries' like 'connections between interface structures' which are high variation enough to be useful in problem-solving
        - for example, structures like 'connections between interface structures' are useful as bases for workflows/interface queries bc they implement a core interaction function like 'connect' and the interface queries have enough variation that this connection will likely contain enough variation to solve the problem
        - 'requirements/intents and implementations/examples/specifications' are a connection between interface structures that can be applied to implement a 'connect' intent for problem/solution structures, like 'connect solution requirements with implementation/examples/specifications of those requirements' which is a general problem-solving intent, which applies 'varying a connection' to the 'similarities between interface structures' that create 'opportunities for new workflows'
        - similarly, given that the connection between complexity/simplicity involves a 'reduction' in complexity, this interface structure connection can be used to implement a workflow with a 'reduce' intent
        - similarly, 'varying a connection (to find more useful variants)' is useful in the same way that 'change a base solution' and 'alternating between extremes/opposites' is useful as a problem-solving structure, but is a specific variant of 'change a base solution' which applies a 'known connection between interfaces' as a 'solution' (as in a 'truth/useful structure')
        - relatedly, selecting between these variance structures like 'varying a connection/suboptimality/error' and 'alternating between extremes/opposites' is related to identifying the 'required variation to solve a problem' (low variation requirements indicating 'changing a structure in a trivial way' and high variation requirements indicating 'identifying bases like extremes/opposites to apply as a range/limit and filtering the many options in between with maximal differences', indicating that in the lower variation case, a 'one-base workflow' is sufficient, and in the higher variation case, more bases are useful)
            - this creates opportunities for integrated/iterated workflows like a workflow that applies 'alternate between extremes' to the set of variance structures (like 'varying a connection/solution' and 'alternating between opposites'), to connect these intents where 'required variation' are ambiguous
        - relatedly, identifying interface-solution metrics like 'required variation/optimization/specification' and identifying their connections is useful to avoid implementing specific solution metrics for solving a problem (rather than applying specific solution metrics, identify required variation and the associated sets of required complexity/optimization/specification and identify implementing specifications of those interface requirements)
        - relatedly, 'usages' are a structure that is useful for predicting errors in a structure, so applying/automating/iterating 'usages' is a way to identify errors
        - relatedly, an intent like 'identify physical variants of interface structures (like a position where a concept originates or exists)' is unlikely to be fulfillable bc in order to be useful, interface structures need to be distributed and they need to interact with other structures in order to be defined, and identifying their isolated positions requires isolation that invalidates their definitions, but thinking about this is useful for connecting representations of reality as in 'connecting other interfaces to reality', since a network of interfaces determines reality so these cant be isolated, however a variable can 'become more causative and more representative of the concept of cause' by being higher variation and by being used more, but given that other inputs to cause exist, the destruction of one causal variable would create an opportunity for another to become causative
        - relatedly, interface structures like variables like 'reusability' are usable as bases for theories like 'structures that are used the most become used more', which partly explains the more frequent identification of structures that are mentioned more (an efficiency that is related to a simulation theory, which avoids the cost of creating new variation by reusing whatever structures are available)

    - identify useful structures like 'variants of relevance spectrums' and 'reasons why relevance is created like crossing an interface structure like an extreme' as useful for problem-solving intents like 'identify new useful graphs to query based on interface structure similarities/connections'
        - for example, cross-interface structures like 'extremes within an interface' which cross interfaces (crossing the 'extreme' interface in another interface) create relevance structures through these intersections (its relevant to know if a function is implemented so extremely that it crosses another interface and that interface as in the way the function is implemented becomes more relevant than the function interface), which is the same structure that solves the problem of 'solving traps (like by connecting back to the interface network by applying variables/interfaces)' and the problem of 'find useful structures' (by 'finding which structures are the most interactive')
            - the same structures (cross-interface structures) solve these problems bc these problems ('identify/generate/change relevance') have an overlap
            - identifying cross-interface structures as useful for implementing core intents like 'identify' of relevance structures is a matter of identifying 'multi-functionality/interactivity' as relevant and identifying cross-interface structures as multi-functional/interactive
            - solving other problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation' for relevance is similarly useful
            - this can be used to implement a workflow like 'start from any interface structure and use it to create relevance through intersectivity'
        - relatedly, 'similarity spectrums' (like a spectrum from an isolated object like the 'complexity definition network' to a series of 'similarities to bases' like 'complexity based on volatility' to a standardized similarity structure like an integrated graph of complexity/power/other interface variables according to a general interface like variation/relevance) are useful as a variant of 'relevance spectrums', which can be used to identify 'positions to start/end at on the similarity spectrum to connect with queries of structures that can connect those points on the spectrum', which is useful as an alternative 'alternation structure' to base queries on (vacillating between extremes/relevant values on a 'similarity spectrum from concept definition networks to concept connection networks' as opposed to vacillating between the 'variation spectrum from constant/specific/filter variation/abstract/generate concept clusters'), where these spectrums (indicating increases/extremes in value) can make a structure like 'vacillations/waves' more obviously useful across queries than a 'concept definition network' and networks make 'cycles/endpoints' of queries clearer
        - relatedly, a 'ratio of similarity to useful structures like the interface network' is another useful relevance structure to identify 'limits/filters for useful implementations/usages/queries'
        - relatedly, 'identifying abstract info structure connections/similarities' is useful for identify 'probably useful interface query components' like how a sequence like 'more -> reduce -> less' has variants like 'more -> reduce -> abstraction/unit/simplification', where these query components connect core functions and interface structures where there are relatively relevant alternatives in these sets of 'interface structure/function' components (this is a reduced set of query components and selecting the most relevant variant is trivial, like identifying whether 'less/abstraction' is more useful for creating the solution, since these are very orthogonal variables)
        - relatedly, 'opposites' like 'abstract/specific' are a useful base structure (a 'set of bases' which acts as a set of limits/filters) to base queries on for 'filter' intents (filter as in 'find the point on the spectrum in between these extremes where the solution is'), given a 'opposite-resolution query structure' like a 'vacillation that slows/converges to a point', which is made more relevant by adding interfaces (as in 'vacillate between abstract truth/specific truth networks')
            - similarly, as a different query type/structure than 'finding an interim value between extremes/opposites', a 'set of bases' (like 'truth/validity networks') is useful for 'change' intents like identifying changes created by combining/connecting the bases that can 'identify a new related base' (like 'possibility networks'), and similarly, a 'set of bases' like a 'set of maximal different solutions to change' is useful for 'filter' intents
        - relatedly, some variables are always relevant to some degree, like how anything that 'increases variation/freedom' is always relevant, even if it doesnt 'describe every interaction' or 'directly/completely describe an interaction', so 'oxygen' is related to thinking bc it increases 'variation in the form of freedom' which is an input to thinking

    - identify useful structures like 'variables of a similarity index network like structures being connected like similarities by abstraction like complexity/volatility, similarities by variation/uncertainty, embedded/net/base/interface similarities, similarities embedded in structure vs. usage, similarities of usage/implementation and similarities of relevance/comparison', and identify their useful structures that can integrate them like 'cross-interface (abstract/specific and constant/variation) comparison relevance structures (like alignments)'
        - for example, a 'similarity index network' that is organized by 'useful comparison relevance structures like comparison sequences like how identifying one ratio (like the number of points in a range indicating an average) can be followed by identifying other relevant ratios (like points in a range based on the identified average in the previous comparison)' is another way to organize this graph other than 'similarity between similarities' or 'similarity between independent variables like volatility', where this graph organizes by usefulness of similarities so that 'similarities that frequently are required in a sequence' occur in a sequence in that graph
        - relatedly, another integrated graph is a 'abstract/specific and variation/constant alignment graph where the abstractions are nodes and specifications are the variation around these nodes' or a graph that similarly starts with abstractions and adds specificity according to the level of specificity found in most solutions (like a specific function type, a specific matrix, etc), where the abstractions are organized by similarity and specifications of each abstraction are organized around that abstraction
        - this is a matter of identifying the similarities that are required to exist but arent determined yet like 'problem/solution connections' and applying them in a graph as variables with some limit defined by the requirement, using some structure like 'relevant facts/definitions' as a base, or applying known problem/solution connections as network connections and applying changes to those known connections to identify the general pattern of the problem/solution connection

    - identify useful structures like 'integrations of graphs that are useful for queries' like 'abstract/structure relevance graphs' or a 'query similarity graph integrated with the similarity index network', which are likely to be a good base for queries, and variables of these graphs like 'applying high variation structures like vertexes or cross-interface structures as nodes' which is useful to base queries on, bc relatively few functions will be required to change these high variation connections
        - 'average/ratio/intersection' comparison structures are useful to filter queries by relevance and other useful bases (to fulfill a query for 'general info' by applying an 'average'), such as the average-relevance query, the low-relevance volatility query, etc, given that these variables indicate similarities (an 'average' indicating a 'general/frequent/interim' connection, 'ratio' indicating a 'relative' connection, 'intersections between function sets' indicating an 'overlap' connection), and similarities are useful when organized in a similarity index network for intents like 'similarity stacking (like "average ratio intersections")' but are also useful to apply to other structures like 'query usages/implementations', to identify the 'most average abstract interface query', etc, where the optimal variant of these graphs hasnt been identified yet so is a useful problem to solve to find the most useful interface queries for the most useful intents, and the most useful structures to use in those queries
        - relatedly, the 'limits of comparisons' are useful to identify, where 'comparing already similar structures like a type variant', 'comparing to a base like a standard', or 'comparing to a space like a context/system/usage' is useful as a set of 'varying variation containers' to filter with more specificity
        - relatedly, identifying interface queries based on usages (like how a match/use/combine function usually follows a filter function, similar to how generate/filter often occur in a sequence) is possible to identify a useful variant of the index of similarities (like how complexity/volatility are connected) and the network of useful interface queries having those variables (complex/volatile queries), which will have some overlaps by default, but which have probably more useful variants (like where interface queries are mixed with the similarity index network, like where 'complexity filters' would connect complexity to other variables), since its more useful to find an integrated base if there is one than to use separate bases which complicates queries
        - the 'abstract/structure-connecting relevance network' is another useful example of an integrated graph (depicting cross-interface structures like 'abstract-structure connection' as nodes) that is useful to base queries on (base queries on a network of nodes like the 'average/general connection', which is relevant bc averages can contain general info, so when general info is required/useful/relevant, an implementing structure is already defined in the map connecting abstract/structure connections)

    - identify useful structures like useful graphs like the "graph of a problem's requirements/definitions/etc where variation/constant are separated" to identify useful 'workflow variants' from useful 'usages of that graph' 
        - the graph of 'constant vs. variation' variables (like complexity/requirements/definitions, etc) is useful to identify as a default graph to create for a given problem, where merely identifying connections between these variables for a problem will likely solve it bc most problems can be solved by simple combinations/sequences of interface structures of the problem (like its opposite position on the graph of 'constant vs. variation' variables)
        - connecting independent (as in 'extremes' like constant/variation or 'cross-interface' or 'cross-relevance' connections) variants of 'variation/complexity/uncertainty/functionality/usages' or connecting them with their opposites (constants/simplicity/information/requirements/implementations) is likely to solve a problem that contains enough variation to solve other problems or solves the original problem directly
        - this is related to 'matching variation across similarities like matching uncertainties (as connected in some way by default)' but generalizes it to include general problem structures and to include connections to their opposites (connecting variation with constants) to solve enough variation to probably include a solution to a relevant or the original problem
        - for example, workflows have 'interface variants' like how 'try every possible solution' such as 'try every possible change to the problem or a known solution'
        - similarly, 'abstractions/specifications' of a problem are likely to contain a 'more useful variant' that is likelier to be useful in some way such as being 'better defined and more connectible to a solution'

    - identify useful structures like 'extensions of cases of problem/solution connections' to identify useful structures like 'starting points for interface queries which intersect with the most extensions of these problem/solution connections'
        - for example, how I figured out that 'brain disorders' might be related to 'autoimmunity' was a simple matter of identifying 'immunity' as a 'determining variable' and identifying that 'problems cause other problems', and I also figured out that addiction is related to metabolism/mitochondria by reading that 'cocaine addiction' is modified by 'magnetic stimulation', which made me think that an 'addicted brain' needed help 'creating connections, specifically cross-brain as opposed to local connections' and needed help with similar functions like 'getting energy' and I knew that 'drugs were often a shortcut to get resources like energy more easily', and I figured out that 'some conditions are related' bc theyre treated with 'similar solutions like similar vitamins' and that these conditions 'interact directly with similar determining variables' like 'stress/immunity' and also 'problems cause other problems'
            - this indicates that identifying variables of cases like 'where a solution can likely solve other problems or when multiple problems have similar/equal solutions' is useful to connect problem/solution structures like solution metrics to those 'cases or extensions of those cases' to find 'intersections with those cases/extensions', to identify the useful structures that intersect with the most extensions of cases
        - this is similar to 'extending problem definitions or solution metrics until they intersect' but starts with problem/solution connections like those referenced above

    - identify useful structures like 'unresolved differences between bases (like truth/validity/interaction networks)' as useful as a 'core problem format'
        - given a connection like 'organ damage' -> 'low hormones (low dhea)' -> 'over-active immunity' -> 'other conditions like multiple sclerosis', if you only knew the 'low dhea' -> 'multiple sclerosis' connection, how might you identify the selection of, position of, and connection to high variation variables like 'organ damage' and 'immunity'?
            - 'organ damage' can be positioned at the start by default with low information, given its 'common position as a cause of conditions'
            - 'immunity' can be assumed to be relevant in some way, similar to how hormones can be assumed to be relevant to most conditions
            - given the few remaining 'highly determining variables' left in the sequence at this point ('organ damage' -> 'hormones (low dhea)' -> 'other conditions like multiple sclerosis'), 'immunity' can be assigned a position after 'organ damage', given that its already identified elsewhere that there is a connection between 'organ damage and the immune system (which is involved in repair processes)', and given that 'hormones' are 'common change requesters/causers', they can be assigned a position before 'immunity', and similarly if its known that the caused condition is an autoimmune condition, immunity can be positioned as an adjacent/direct cause
            - these positions arent required but are useful to relate given the probable associations, and trivial variants of this sequence are probably similarly valid, given how these variables are cyclical in their interactions, so a cyclical connection is more accurate than a one-directional connection
            - similarly, extremes like 'low hormones' and 'over-active immunity' are likelier to be directly connectible
            - rather than connecting to every important variable like 'mutations', its useful to identify 'independent system connections' (like how organ damage and multiple sclerosis arent directly associated), and its useful to identify important independent system connections that are likely to be common causes (given the commonness of organ damage, its useful to connect to other common conditions)
            - most other sequences of these variables are probably also possible, if not as probable as this sequence
                - similarly, identifying the 'relatively few sequences of these high variation variables that dont apply or are not possible/probable' is likely to have 'patterns or other identifiable determinants' and to be the useful 'reduced set of connections' to identify, where all other possible connections are applicable/probable/possible
                - the 'sequences of how to isolate or prevent these variables from interacting' are likelier to be the 'more reduced set to identify' given their common interactions
                - specifically, 'identifying related sequences' like sequences of related types like 'organs that cause immunity' (like adrenal glands) is a way to identify 'organ damage as possibly causing immune problems' (like over-active immunity)
                - identifying the degree at which these sequences stop being causative (given that every organ contributes to immunity but not every organ directly causes it) is useful to identify 'interface limits'
            - another way to identify this connection is to position 'stress or change' as the interface connecting all other variables, and to index 'organ damage' and 'over-active immunity' as 'stress variations' that likely connect other variables (if some set of variables isnt directly connectible like 'low dhea' and 'multiple sclerosis', try applying "alternations of different stress/change types" like 'organ damage' or 'over-active immunity' until these variables are connected, which also determines the sequence of 'organ damage' -> 'over-active immunity' given that one 'stress type' more probably causes the other given that one is more clearly a 'stress response')
                - similarly to applying 'stress' as an 'indirect base interface' (connected to regularly, given the high variation added by varying stress types, a level of variation which isnt required at every step, like the last step, which could be formatted as variation within a type of over-active immunity, or which could be formatted as a stress of 'focus/isolation' of over-active immunity within a system like the 'nervous system'), applying 'variation' as a 'direct connecting interface' (connected to at every step, where each 'varied base' adds enough variation and applies sufficiently generally to interact with a different 'varied base') is useful to identify 'variation from a base' as a common structure identifies possible structures to apply ('lower than normal count/distribution of a compound' and 'differences in a structure from its normal state' are useful abstract 'varied base' structures to connect)
                    - this 'sequence of varied bases' has less specific info than 'sequence of stress types' but they are useful variants of each other given the stress/change connection (a 'varied' structure is a 'stressed' structure in some degree, given that 'stress' is a 'change' type), but stress impacts fewer variables directly than change in general, so its useful specificity comes at a cost that it may not be able to adjacently connect every variable set
                    - identifying these 'interface structure trade-offs' (identify 'specific interface limits' by specifying change types vs. identify general 'variation interactions' with general change types) is useful to identify optimizations (identify general 'interface limit extensions/interactions' from 'specific interface limits')
                    - identifying specific change types like 'stress types' and specific change structures like 'varied bases' that occur frequently enough that they can almost always connect some variable set to some degree, if incompletely, is useful to identify so that the connection errors of these structures can be identified (to identify rules such as "if 'stress types' or 'varied bases' cant connect some variable set, a limit has been reached or some connecting base is unidentified")
                - similarly, identifying the 'specific connections between (variations from bases, or variation inputs like stress types)' is another useful interface to apply, such as identifying the sequences mentioned above, such as identifying how 'under-prioritization can lead to over-prioritization of a related structure'
                - relatedly, identifying the maximal differences possible in a variable (low/medium/high levels) is similarly useful given the similar size of search space (high levels of dhea can also probably cause autoimmune conditions, given the frequently 'small ranges of usefulness' of compounds, which are a useful solution structure to identify)
                - relatedly, identifying the 'limits on causation potential of a variant of a structure' ('identifying how high levels of a compound could not cause a particular condition bc it would cause death before it could ever cause a condition') is useful as a way to identify 'what compounds cant be filtered out as possible causes of a condition'
                - given the relatively indirect connection above, more direct connections exist such as 'organ damage' -> 'cancer' -> 'multiple sclerosis' (apply a similarity to 'generality' of error type, given that system errors can cause other system errors) and 'organ damage' -> 'nerve damage' -> 'multiple sclerosis' (apply a similarity to a difference/error type by making it constant), which are useful to identify as 'more direct and therefore more useful sequences to identify if valid (like 'general variable connections' or 'error/difference similarities')', which is possible bc these connecting variables are higher variation than other variables used in less direct connections
                - relatedly, applying patterns in valid structures like 'error type difference similarities' (an embedded structure like 'difference similarity difference similarities') is useful for finding abstract interface query structures like sequences like 'varied base of a varied base' which require 'interactivity such as overlap information' to complete ('general change sequences require specific interactivity info like structure/position/input/frequency/distribution info in order to be useful', which abstracts to 'interface variable (general) interface structures like change require interface variable (specific) directly connected interface structures like interactivity/structure to be useful (to connect a structure to relevance)', which is similar to how multiple relevance components like 'reusability/generality/interactivity' are often required for an interface query that solves a problem, so starting interface queries around these relevance components is a useful base to start from and connect other structures like 'change sequences' to)
                - this is related to how variants of some interface variables like 'spectrums' are useful to vary/alternate/vacillate in an interface query like 'abstraction/specificity', where other structures are useful to regularly connect to as a common base such as 'components of relevance like interactivity/similarity' given common workflows like 'generate/filter' which align with these structures, to identify other workflow structures like 'extensions' such as 'generate/filter/organize' or 'generate/filter/interact' or 'generate/filter/orient' which are useful 'repeatable/composable query components connected to relevance'
                - this identifies a core similarity as useful to connect other structures with into an interface query, such as how "interactivity can be used as a base to connect 'varied bases' which might require interactivity to be relevant, if varied bases are the selected format for variables to connect" which identifies 'interface structures like relevance components that can be used as a base, and structures which are connectible/specifiable/reducible/otherwise relevant using that base', by identifying the missing structure of a 'sequence of changes' as a 'structure that requires these changes to interact in a sequence' like 'interactivity or specific interaction types, or standardizability/similarizability/connectivity/causability' (a 'change sequence' can be connected with some interface like 'cause/abstraction/interactivity' to make it 'relevant'), so these 'structure/similarity' and 'variable/similarity' and 'change/interact' and 'difference/similarity' and other 'interface/relevance' sets can be applied to filter interface queries, which identifies 'similarity index network of bases' as useful to filter interface queries, given that 'unresolved differences between bases' are a core problem format
        - relatedly, as mentioned elsewhere, 'matching high variation variables like frequency/uncertainties/variation/complexity' is a general intent that is useful for problem-solving in systems like the bio-system ('brain disorders are so poorly understood that they likely relate to other poorly understood structures like protein folding dynamics, mutations, immunity, organ damage, infections, and hormonal imbalances')
        - relatedly, identifying 'structural damage' as a cause of 'autoimmunity' is useful to connect by 'interactivity' (the frequent 'interactions' required by repairing organ damage are useful as a predictor of other conditions created by 'repair errors' like autoimmunity, similar to how 'dna copying/repair errors' cause conditions by causing mutations and creating unusable copies of dna which interact with other structures)
        - relatedly, other problems are more relevant to solve ('given that essential organ failure like heart failure frequently causes death, how can existing recovery functions be enhanced to improve recovery like recovery from exercise or medical conditions') which would invalidate existing problems (solving 'recovery/waste clearance' is the better problem to solve than solving the problem of 'maintaining a level of organ damage once organ damage has occurred')
        - identifying all connections between 'extreme/general problems' like those likely to be identified (like 'how can a vitamin deficiency or hormonal imbalance or organ damage cause cancer'), identifying 'sufficient survival' to develop complications ('given that most problems will cause other problems, how long do they need to survive for those related problems to occur'), identifying interactions with identified problems and general systems that indicate probability of causing other conditions (if its an identified condition, it probably interacts with general system variables like immunity/hormones), identifying probability of one condition to cause errors (cause damage, increased interactivity leading to resolution errors like copying errors, and take resources away from preventing complications) that lead to other errors (mutations, autoimmunity) are all useful for identifying determining variables of problems in a system like the 'bio system'
        - relatedly, 'hormonal/immunity imbalances' are frequently the 'connecting variable' of some related structure set like a 'symptom/condition' (for example, 'organ damage like kidney damage can cause cancer bc of the hormonal imbalances that can result like low aldosterone which cause systemic problems like acidosis which helps cancer and cancer triggers like fungus grow' is one of many connections between general variables like organ damage/infection/hormones/acidity that can cause a condition like cancer), whenever other connecting variables like 'mutations/infections' arent applicable, though these causes more frequently occur in structures like 'combinations' and 'overlaps' and 'cycles' rather than 'directly and in isolation'

    - identify useful structures like 'conceptual ranges connecting cross-interface structures (like relevance/connections)' that can fulfill useful intents like 'connect other useful structures' and 'be converted into other useful structures' like 'problem-solving intents' using 'specifications/overlaps'
        - for example, 'connecting different suboptimal structures like different errors and other non-solutions/sub-optimalities' like 'connecting "connections/relevance" to identify "similarities" as useful in problem-solving for adding relevant/specific differences than abstract connections' is useful as a way of identifying the position of solutions by identifying the position of non-solutions and identifying variation in between and around them (which is interim or variable/base thinking)
        - similarly, identifying a non-solution structure like the 'next problem to solve' (the problems that will occur once a problem is solved) are useful to identify since they may be useful in solving the current problem (once regression is solved by identifying n-d graphs of abstract concepts having the same base like variation, which solves it by identifying the abstract variable similarity index network of n-d functions, optimizing these abstract variable connections and identifying optimal usages like optimal grids of these abstract variable networks are the next problems to solve, which can identify useful variables to solve the original problem of identifying the current positions of these abstract variables in their network)
        - this is similar to identifying 'what is different from errors/suboptimal solutions' to identify solutions but applies it to the problem-solving sequence to identify non-solution structures beyond the solution like limits or future problems which can be used as a base to differentiate from or connect to (identifying future intents can identify useful functions to implement now which are likely to be useful in solving current problems)
        - this applies the concept of a 'range' to the problem of 'identifying solution structures like solution areas/positions/limits/averages' in a conceptual problem format ('similarities' are between 'connections/relevance', being more relevant than just any general connection for their 'specificity', and similarly being useful in a more 'specific' way than relevance, and are useful for connecting those concepts), which identifies a general problem-solving intent of 'connecting abstract concepts to relevance to identify workflows/intents based on these connections, given that it will be possible to create relevance using structures implementing those concepts once their connections to relevance are identified', so 'identifying that connections/relevance are limits of a range containing another variable' is the useful implementation of a 'conceptual range' that identifies a new problem-solving workflow like 'identify future problems as a possible base to connect to or change' as well as a problem-solving intent like 'identify concept-relevance connections to identify new filters of interface queries' like how identifying that similarities are in between connections/relevance identifies that connections can be made relevant by identifying similarities'
        - similarly, 'identifying specific useful structures and their overlaps with specific connection types' is another problem-solving intent derivable from the core 'conceptual range' structure
        - relatedly, 'identifying new variation' is a matter of 'identifying simple connections between difficult as in 'distant/complex/irrelevant' structures' which can take the form of 'identifying the most adjacent/simple connections between simplicity/complexity and identifying the most adjacent/simple connections between the most irrelevant structures on the complexity interface and across interfaces', which identifies a 'similarity index network' on these spectrum variables like 'complexity/generality' as useful to identify
        - relatedly, differentiating the relevance like the 'useful variation/relevant differences' of cross interface structures (like different concepts in equivalent formats like 'complexity/volatility') vs. iterated structures (in structures like embeddings/applications like 'complex volatility') vs. overlapping structures (structures that are both complex/volatile) is useful for graphing these structures
 
    - identify useful structures like 'overlapping similarities that can be compared by the same metric like count/position' as a useful 'default set of comparisons to run in queries' and 'interim relevance structures between in/direct comparison structures'
        - for example, 'general irrelevance' is useful to identify, such as when a variable comparison is trivial bc it doesnt change/determine enough other variables to prevent resolution of the problem by other functions, so identifying the 'meaningful comparison' like whether the variable being compared 'can create enough variation to determine a problem resolution (or usage interaction of a solution)' is more useful than the original comparison in some cases, where specific value comparisons sometimes have 'general relevance' (like 'whether a universal constant is relevant or not') and these cases can be identified to determine whether that comparison should be applied
        - similarly, other variants of comparisons are useful to identify, like aggregated/net similarities, similarity limits, filter sequence/metadata similarities, usage/implementation symmetry, causal/input similarities, alternative similarities, etc, as structures that create relevance through adding similarities/connections as opposed to structures that create relevance through adding differences like 'vertexes, opposites or changing/determining variables'
        - this applies comparisons by different structures than structures like 'unit/type similarities, which allow useful comparisons by count' or 'sequential similarities like cause, which allow comparison by sequential position' or 'average similarities which allow comparisons by distance from/position relative to the average or ratio of area overlapping with average area', comparing problems to different bases (like aggregated/net/total similarities, similarity similarities like ratios of similarities, usage similarities like the usage/implementation vertex, variation similarities, problem similarities, relevance similarities, etc) that can invalidate a problem or its variables if those variables dont change adjacent interactions or change the interaction level/base/interface more or differently than other variables, which are useful to identify overlapping metrics across similarities/comparisons
        - this is based on the fact that not every workflow involves 'direct comparisons of problem variables' (although most do like how 'trial and error' involves a comparison in its filter function and filters can involve comparisons between already filtered and unfiltered structures), so 'indirect comparisons of independent variables' are another useful position to start from, and in between in/direct comparison extremes are structures like 'net similarities' and 'abstract similarities' and 'comparison function implementations' and 'mixed-relevance structures'

    - identify useful structures like 'useful graphs of interim variables between interface variables and an integrated graph' like 'graphs of iterated interface structures like complexity limits and query variation' and 'graphs optimized for identifying similarities, like graphs with similar bases' ('identifying similarities/averages/bases' to identify the strongest similarities on which variation is based across queries being a useful intent for 'integrating graphs', as an alternative to 'identifying aggregations/interactions' to graph the differences that are similar in type/additivity/other variables, or 'identifying maximal differences' to only graph the most unique differences)
        - for example, cross interface structures like 'complexity limits' and 'query variation' and 'cross-context volatility' are useful as interim graphs for connecting interface variables like 'complexity' on the same graph (a graph of the connection 'as limits on complexity increase, how does query variation change'), like where there is a 'symmetry in variation patterns across complexity structures', so that symmetry is the emergent 'complexity based on variation function', as opposed to an aggregate function of complexity or other simplified integration function of these graphs
        - similarly, other metadata of 'complexity' can be graphed to indicate relevant differences than complexity limits/reductions, like complexity-based variation, complexity-sorted variation, complexity-relevance, etc, so that these metadata can be applied to queries 'complexity-relevant queries', where complexity is a determining or otherwise relevant variable) to identify patterns/other structures in similar queries like to identify 'variable connections as well as efficient connections across queries'
        - this abstracts the usefulness of 'power-based queries' to 'cross-interface queries' in general and other similarly useful structures, where they are specifically useful in connecting graphs like by 'integrating graphs of cross-interface structures'
        - this is relevant for filtering interface queries like where 'applying changes between bases' is specifically useful for some bases like truth/validity/possibility/probability networks, and 'trying every possibility' is useful for specific sets of structures that can be iterated to maximize usefulness (every time interface structures are iterated, there is usually something valuable that can be derived from the iteration), which allows for optimizing where workflows are applied in a query
        - relatedly, these workflows are usage variants of core functions like 'change/filter' that are more optimally specified in some way in most cases except the general case, so the general workflow can be matched to more general solution spaces where required specifications are not yet identifiable

    - identify useful structures like 'superpositions of a query structure like a query variation grid on a similarity index network' that are useful for intents like 'identify new variation in a standardized system where new variation is maximally useful like the math interface'
        - for example, identifying the 'network of incomplete queries that, when completed, will solve a problem like "identify new variation"' is useful to identify the 'specific functions to execute to finish solving a problem' in a space where many of these queries are likely to be possibly useful and further filtering of the requirements/usage for queries is not possible, to identify a query network that can identify 'positions/ranges of a solution like "required positions/ranges of variation"' rather than identifying the "network of extensions of the definitions of abstract variables like 'complexity' and their intersections", or identifying the "intersections of useful structures like specific math variables like 'volatility'" or the connections between these networks (like 'with sufficient independence/variation/specification in a structure like a system/set, is additivity required'), which is useful to fulfill intents like 'identify probable positions/ranges of new useful constants' by identifying 'which queries, when positioned in a structure like a "grid" in a numerical space like a "euclidean space or real number spectrum", will identify probable solutions to identifying variables like "variation" in any given grid section, when those queries are completed'
            - for example, this can take the form of applying a 'grid of equidistant variance on top of a similarity index network', like 'every point where this metric like "number" of variables vary, on the similarity index network' to identify 'equivalent variation or similarities in variantion' as in 'variation units' on a standardized structure like the similarity index network, and identifying useful queries to start applying at those points or on those points of variation to resolve 'remaining variation between the points' with trivially filtered queries to complete the query (at the point where the position on the grid is identified, additional queries to complete the query to resolve remaining variation is trivial)
            - similarly, applying a 'variation grid' or other variable structure to other structures is possibly useful, like applying a 'variation grid' to query variables like 'query times' to identify 'variation structures like variation patterns' between 'query creation/run/implementation/call/completion time', to identify useful alignments/changes in variation structures like 'maintaining variation above a ratio during a query to avoid repeating queries' or 'alternating variation structures with constants during a query to avoid unrestricted increases in variation during queries', which I thought of when thinking about how 'conditional statements are more useful during development time to check for functionality of multiple code components, than at usage time when causative errors are more useful to identify'
            - this is related to applying 'comparisons to multiple bases like multiple networks' but applies comparisons to an 'integrated/embedded structure of bases like an integrated network', where identifying these useful integrations of useful networks is useful given that its likely that there are multiple alternate useful integrations with complementary usefulness
            - generally, identifying useful "filters of high variation structures like 'networks'" like useful 'grids to apply to a network' and useful 'embeddings/layers/orientations/variants of networks' like useful 'variants of the similarity index network to optimize for maximally different queries (or other useful queries to connect)' is useful
        - similarly, applying the specific variant of the similarity index network on specific interfaces like the math interface is useful for applying a highly standardized structure to a highly standardized space like the math interface which identifies the 'strictest possible complying changes to the standardized structure that can be re-applied elsewhere'
            - similarly, identifying the variations of real number spaces that are useful to apply in connecting related numbers like where 'important numbers are connected with similar angles/distances' is useful as a step on the sequence of graphs connecting defined number spaces with new graphs like the 'similarity index network on specific interfaces like the math interface'
        - relatedly, 'incorrect indexing of identifiers' is useful to identify since, once a structure is described or indexed, that description/indexing is likely to be inaccurate given common indexing rules like 'identify a unique identifier at the time of indexing', and updating existing identified indexes/descriptions to reflect new unique info is a related useful intent, to not only fit new info in to an index but to fit existing info with new info
        - relatedly, iterated specification structures like 'highly determining/filtering positions/changes' is a useful example of a type of default query component that fulfills some useful specific metric like the 'determining function' in some usefully specific way 'extremely' using some usefully specific structure like 'position', which are useful to specify and combine
            - relatedly, 'abstracting a structure until it crosses a threshold of relevance/meaning' is another example of a useful query component to find useful interactions, where there is likely additional useful info in the 'abstracting' direction from most positions in most graphs
            - relatedly, if a structure is 'sufficiently general/constant/structural/available/variable/etc', there is a way to use it to solve problems, which are useful thresholds to identify
        - relatedly, identifying 'connections between bases' (like 'base solutions' and 'limits' or 'base solutions' and 'validity/truth networks') which are useful to identify variation structures like 'possible variation between bases' and 'variants of workflows' like 'variants that connect to multiple bases' like 'change a base solution, in directions of possible variation, given these specific/general limits on variation and barriers to variation or these solution metric filters or these networks like validity networks or this remaining variation like unapplied changes'
            - relatedly, a problem common to many workflows is 'complete standardization/identification' since info is often missing so for example 'identifying all relevant requirements' is usually not possible, so a general problem-solving intent is 'connecting relevant incomplete interface structures', similar to how identifying interface structures of limits like 'specific/general limits' is useful to solve the common problem of 'identifying variation and its structures like its change functions'
        - relatedly, identifying valid prediction rules like 'whether some structure can occur bc of resource availability/distribution or probability/commonness/repetition or perspective/position or variation/certainty ratios' is useful bc there is likely a very reduced set of these that are useful to identify as 'only some subset of connection sequences can occur, given some set of connection rules indicating reliable predictions from causes' so identifying 'which of these structures cant be causative or which connection sequences cant occur or be predicted' is useful to filter the 'possible sets of connection rules' (such as 'any trivially identified set of cross-interface structures can be changed trivially to create any structure, given the distribution of these structures' or 'only structures whose inputs are allowed to vary can become generally constant/stable/true'), where the more indirect/distant/independent the connection, the more determining the connection bc it connects more differences, as opposed to defined prediction rules like 'only structures which are interactive can be causative' (interaction is implicitly defined by causation), which can enable identifying 'connection sequences in prediction rules' like 'changes to prediction rules' as in 'new prediction rules that will become more useful/true' as in 'what rules will be useful/usable, if these rules are currently the most useful' (like 'is there a way to guarantee that resource availability will always be useful in predictions in some sequence of prediction rules, and is there a predictable connection sequence to that way' like how 'one-variable similarities are useful in determining networks' and 'networks are useful in determining multi-variable similarities' so this is a 'possible prediction connection sequence', where filtering these sequences by 'whether they can support predictions of extremes like infinities and whether they can avoid invalidations' is useful to identify possible timelines and their probable/required structures like their intersections

    - identify useful structures like 'intersections between maximally independent variables' which are useful for intents like 'identify structures that can determine the solutions to other problems when interface structures like specifications are applied to these structures' (when the intersections between complexity/volatility/etc are identified using 'some interim value between in/dependence like is involved in high variation non-1-to-1 mappings, and some extension of the definitions of in/dependence like parallels/intersections', these intersections can be specified to identify other intersections and other useful structures), which identifies structures like 'combinations' of independent concepts like 'complexity power' as 'useful to define/connect for this intent'
        - identifying 'independent' variables like 'parallels' of math systems/spaces is a way of 'identifying intersections/overlaps/similarities' in math which are the most useful structures to identify, which applies 'identify a structure by identifying its opposite structure and identifying their structures like positions/areas/overlaps/boundaries/limits', such as identifying independent variables like 'variables that are based off of very distant variables' such as 'volatility and independence' which are not 1-to-1 mappable, and identifying the 'possible intersections of these independent variables' is useful to identify if they are 'real parallels in the sense of never intersecting', given that there is a 'point between independence/dependence' where these highly useful structures exist as 'intersections between many variables'
        - relatedly, identifying inputs of intersections like '"similarities but not equivalences" or "maximal differences" in direction' and 'lack of barriers/limits to intersections' and 'repeatability/iterability' is similarly useful
        - relatedly, identifying how other structures like 'sets' are useful to identify possible error structures like 'causes of errors', like how 'extremes on a spectrum' are useful to identify as 'over-prioritization errors' and how when 'simplicity is applied in a set with diversity', it can cause an 'over-prioritization of diversity', like how if the concept of 'justice' is left out of the definition of 'diversity', given the 'ability of justice to change a core concept (discrimination/bias) related to diversity' like the 'problem solved by diversity' such as 'discrimination/bias', it would indicate that 'all negative interactions against groups are incorrect' and would falsely include groups bc of the 'false similarity between groups' indicating that 'all groups are equally persecuted' and the false similarity between 'diversity and equality' indicating that 'no group should be treated negatively'
            - this is a possible error with 'higher levels of diversity' but indicates how a spectrum isnt a 'perfect indicator of errors like spectrum extremes' given that many points on the spectrum can easily lead to an extreme error in that spectrum variable if combined with other errors on other spectrums, indicating that the spectrum is better structured as a network or as a spectrum with spectrum-based connections between these non-adjacent connections on the spectrum such as between a 'high level of diversity and an over-prioritization error of extreme diversity' based on where other spectrums like justice intersect with it, and these 'higher levels of diversity' arent 'real diversity' in the sense of 'optimal/useful/stable diversity'
        - relatedly, identifying other concept interactions like 'complexity power' is a useful set of 'combined/iterated/structured abstractions' to apply as default query components to explore these intersections between independent abstract variables as being possibly more useful than the concepts being combined to solve problems
        - relatedly, identifying the 'set of all similarity index network queries' is a set of 'possible connection sequences to apply' that can likely be used as 'workflows to solve problems', similar to how identifying 'sets of differences from differences that lead to errors' is a set of 'possible changes to apply' that can likely be used as 'workflows to solve problems', which are useful to identify as 'possible specific structures of structures of interface structures' that can be used to 'connect most differences', such as how identifying a 'point that if crossed by a solution function, would change many other variables of the function' is useful to identify as a 'highly determining variable to check for correctness/relevance for inclusion in a solution function' rather than 'filtering the solution space' in other ways like 'applying extensions to definitions of solution metrics', bc these are relevant as in 'powerful', 'high variation', 'highly intersective', 'general as in generally relevant' variables of problems/solutions
        - relatedly, identifying structures like degrees of change between problems or indications of problems is useful (like 'how many degrees are applied before a condition causes another condition or a symptom that clearly identifies it')
        - relatedly, identifying how a function like 'force' can be used in different ways to solve problems is useful like 'select a solution and force it to be the optimal solution' or 'try every possibility (as in brute force, indicating that the "power of iteration" makes it inevitable/forced that the problem will be solved, although it requires powerful functionality)' (which has variants like 'use the power of other structures like "maximal differences" to guarantee/force an intersection with the optimal solution')

    - identify useful structures like 'relevance comparison structures' like 'average networks' and 'averages of concepts' that are useful as query components or sub-queries of interface queries, given their high info content and connectivity of relevant differences
        - for example, 'comparison to an average' contains info about connections to multiple structures rather than to one structure, which contains a higher info ratio than other comparisons, similar to how a vertex contains 'comparisons to multiple perspectives'
        - similarly, 'comparisons to a concept' are useful in a similar way as 'comparisons to a network', since a 'concept' often has a complex definition network, which is similar to how 'comparisons to a pattern' and 'comparisons to a pattern generator' contain more info
        - extending this, 'averages between concepts', 'averages between standards', etc are useful 'iterations of comparison structures' that contain a higher info ratio, similar to how 'absolute comparisons to all relevant networks' are a useful structure to identify where possible, which is useful, for example, to fulfill intents like 'identify structures that create/contain more relevant differences/variation than other structures'
        - connecting this to relevance, the 'highest relevance comparisons' like 'comparisons across networks (especially high info networks like similarity networks, concept networks or standards networks)' like 'average networks' are useful to identify
        - the difference between the 'useful definition and the useful usage' of a structure is useful to identify, such as how once developed, identified, and defined in some structure like an interaction level, it has a limit on its usefulness in that interaction level

    - identify useful structures like 'query structure patterns' that are useful across problems to identify problem-solving intents like 'identify matching query concept or query "sequences/connections"' and useful structures like 'positions' to apply these similarities with such as 'to connect different but related structures (like problems/solutions)'
        - for example, specific 'matching/symmetric queries' like power/variation/complexity-matching are useful in problem-solving, like how identifying a solution that is similarly high variation to a problem is useful, and 'identifying ways a connection can be true/false, identifying alternatives, and identifying definitions/examples' is useful in complex systems where recursion, interactivity, iteration, and variation are likely to be high, so 'matching the complexity of the system with the problem-solving intent/function' is a useful query to apply, and generally applying 'balances/similarities/symmetries across complexity/power/variation and other problem metrics' are useful to identify useful queries given the usefulness of these variables when equivalent across structures (like 'problem/solution' or 'context/function')
            - this identifies the abstract network of variables like 'power/variation/complexity' and their connections like the 'similarity between power/variation/complexity' as useful for identifying basic query intents like 'reduce complexity' and identifying the useful intents of these abstract network intents involving 'connections to other interfaces like "reduce power/variation/complexity of problems"', these abstract connections providing variables for these queries, where identifying the relevance of these concept structures like the relevance of 'variation/constant structures' like 'complexity/limit combinations (like sequences of complexity reductions)' such as how 'complexity reductions are a similarity/difference or variation/constant structure which could match some problem-solving requirements for similarity/variation' is a useful intent
        - I thought of this when thinking about how knowing the complexity of a system reduced the search space and how it was useful to look for more complex structures like 'ways that an apparently true connection could be false' as being likelier to occur in a complex system similar to how other high variation structures like ambiguity and randomness are likely to occur, and identified that this was a 'complexity-symmetry/match' that could be a useful query on its own or a useful sub-query of a general workflow, and identified that this applied across abstract concepts like 'complexity/variation/power', since these conceptual similarities were useful to standardize/connect structures defined to be 'different but related' like 'problems/solutions or systems/functions'
        - relatedly, 'identifying connections/conversions between these variables (connections between power/balance/variation)' is useful to connect 'sub-queries that identify/generate/reduce/connect power/balance/variation'
            - relatedly, concepts like 'power' are another base for queries similar to functions like 'connect/reduce', and a 'power-based query' has related 'common intents of power-based queries' like 'identify powerful variables like determining/common variables', and given that there are optimal ways to apply 'power' to solve problems like 'distribute power or add power to equalize power or increase usefulness/relevance like multi-functionality', basing queries around these intents can be applying a power-based query as a 'guiding/filtering intent/concept', as opposed to identifying a query that 'regularly connects to power' as its base
        - relatedly, identifying structures like 'similarities or trivial differences that create extreme differences' are useful to identify, like 'changes that create maximal differences like "one-variable or all-variable opposites" that are possible in a spectrum', as a way of identifying 'efficiency' structures
        - relatedly, identifying relevance structures like required relevance and possible irrelevance (like how a description of how something is implemented like 'quickly implemented' doesnt necessarily indicate information about the implementation which is a 'definitively related but possibly irrelevant structure' which is useful as a 'mixed/cross-relevance structure' that is likely useful for implementing a 'similarity/difference structure like a difference in a similarity'), and how structures like 'variables' (like 'complexity') of relevance structures connect to query relevance for a problem
        - relatedly, applying different base functions in query-generation/filtering is useful, like how many queries involve 'connecting sub-queries', where applying a different base function than 'connect' like 'reduce/define/change' as in 'reduce by differentiating/similarizing sub-queries or required sub-queries or adding functionality/generality to sub-queries' or 'define as in "specify or filter" sub-queries' or 'define sub-queries in terms of other sub-queries' is a useful way to implement query generation/filtering

    - identify useful structures like how 'truths can be used to identify other truths, using the meaning/interactivity of base truths' which when applied to related structures of truth like solutions identifies 'solution meanings' as useful to identify and apply as 'reverse/scaled/aggregated/iterated/additive/interactive filters' (extrapolating general/interactive connections that interact with the problem space from a specific solution connection, similar to how useful interim filters exist which can connect any set of structures, and how standard filters reduce an abstraction as in a solution requirement into a specification as in a specific solution)
        - workflows like "identify a possible true statement, apply relevance/interaction structure like a aggregation/extension/iteration of truth and identify its meaning (an interactive/related/general/scaled truth is identified, if the condition that 'the original statement is true' is true), apply a comparison of that meaning to a base network like reality (check if the related truth is true) and identify the meaning of that comparison (a 'contradiction', as in the statement is false)" identify useful applications of the workflow like 'identify solution meanings' to implement 'reverse filters', given that a solution can be applied as a truth structure and its interactions can be identified to identify its meaning (if this solution is true, some other interaction will take place, and if that interaction doesnt match reality, the solution is likely false)
            - this is a 'truth-meaning-truth query' (which can be structured as a 'truth vertex, based on/connected by a base of meaning'), that determines the 'meaningful/relevant structure (as in a truth) of a truth, based on meaning of the original truth'
            - given that 'interactions' act as 'filters', and that filters have variables like 'direction', inputs to interactions like 'aggregations' and its reverse as in opposite (like 'units') can also act as 'filters', and similarly iterated interface filters like 'reverse meaning filters like filters that connect true statements/implications of paradoxes to consistently reverse a statement or its meaning' are also useful to identify ('reverse meaning' doesnt seem to make sense but there are multiple ways to implement it, such as 'reverse a created meaning (to be meaningless)' or 'reverse as in contradict a statement (with a trivial change like a direction change to violate some symmetry)')
        - identify variables/variations of meaning to identify as 'prioritized useful structures for filters to find', like 'distant/adjacent/general/iterated connection/meaning' as in 'true when iterated', 'true when adjacent to another structure', 'generally distant/independent truth', etc, similar to how identifying the meaning of interface structures like the 'meaning of a requirement/possibility/comparison' is useful, like how its useful to identify meanings of iterated/general/useful interface structures like the meaning of 'possible meanings', 'meaning at scale/iteration/aggregation/extension/intersection/extreme'
        - identifying connections to interface structures like similarities trivially identifies the 'differences possible in a meaning' (rather than checking every angle, check its interactions with interface structures to determine possible differences in its meaning)
        - identifying 'un/required relevance' like 1-to-1 mappings is useful, such as how 'how something is used is not required to be relevant to a variable of its implementation as in how it uses other structures, but it is distantly connectible, since the function of how it uses structures could be reused across its interactions so it will impact the structures using it indirectly, so in edge cases it could be extremely relevant'

    - identify useful structures like how 'graphs of cross-interface structures' like 'connections to embedded interface variants' (such as how 'sudden' is a specific embedded variant on the time interface) such as more specific graphs of 'sudden complexity' which can build other more general function types like 'asymmetric relevance' are likely to be useful in general problem-solving intents like 'connecting abstract concepts like power/balance/complexity with the 2-d graph of these variables'
        - for example, various function types are useful to connect, in order to identify the 2-d high variation variable graph, like how the 'set of interface variables based on interface variables (relevance based on independence)' and the 'set of embedded interface variants of those connections, like specific interface variable values based on interface variables like "sudden complexity" or "probable complexity" or "ambiguity of probability"' are likely to be useful in connecting interface variables in one graph by basing the 2-d merged graph of all variables off of these graphs, similar to how basing the graph off of networks like validity/truth networks is useful
        - relatedly, connecting various structures with relevance is useful, like how identifying that 'asymmetries relate to relevance by being useful for creating a variant of relevance like "maximally different/surprising relevance" given that they encode a "difference in a similarity" which is useful for creating other differences similar to non-1-to-1 mappings, which are also related to asymmetries' is useful to identify

    - identify useful structures like 'implementation variables' like 'interface structures like representations/organizations/intersections/requirements/bases' of the 'standardized general similarity index network' which are useful for intents like 'implementing/filtering interface queries'
        - identifying 'different variants of a similarity index network' is useful, since this network will be useful for many core functions like reduce/connect/similarize, but specific network variants will be useful for various intents, like how its useful to 'reduce variation/abstraction/specification' in some queries and this can be optimized by a different network than a general 'similarity index network' (where variables can be connectible with reductions/similarities/other structures and often connect interface variables like abstractions, which represents the 'most standardized structure'), such as 'reduction networks', 'similarity-reducing networks', which are useful for intents like 'identifying the general similarity index network', like how the overlap between 'reducing abstraction networks' and 'increasing info networks' indicates a useful similarity between these networks that can be indicated as a similarity on the general similarity index network, or such as how 'grids/sorts' can be applied to this network so that every nth similarity is a reduction and a connection, which makes it approximately also a reduction and a connection network as well as a similarity network, or by applying overlaps in definitions like how every similarity in the network is a reduction in the number of remaining variables to traverse in a set of interface variables, as the network is constructed to apply every structure in the set in every query that fulfills some metric like 'qualifying as a solution automation workflow' 
        - these networks can be implemented with extensions/connections/intersections of existing definitions like how 'reducing abstraction' indicates 'adding constants, adding variables that dont change the abstract type, or other specifying information', where this definition can be extended in a useful degree (like how other solution metric definitions can be extended/connected to filter the solution space)
        - this identifies other overlapping intents like how identifying the 'balanced level of abstraction identifies the maximal meaning/interactivity/usefulness of a structure' given that both over-abstraction and over-specification remove the interactivity/information/other meaning structures, and identifying the 'query on the general similarity index network indicates the absolute/general meaning of a structure'
        - I thought of this when thinking about how there were 'limits on reducibility/connectivity in a format', where these limits could be determined by the number/type/structure of interfaces that hadnt been reduced in that format yet, which is useful to know when applying a 'reduce' workflow so that other variables like 'format' can be changed to continue reducing if the solution hasnt been found yet (as a way to filter interface queries to implement a 'reduce' workflow) even when the 'possible reducible variation in a format is already reduced', so a 'reduction network' would be useful and identifying how a reduction network would be constructed (like sorted), useful (like for reducing abstraction), and connectible to other networks (like a connection network or the general similarity index network, which likely involves multiple functions connecting its variables of similarity rather than one function) is also useful, where some implementations of this network are identified (like 'apply the meaning interface as the core similarity, then the other interfaces, then sub-interfaces') but the variables of representing/organizing these similarities is not identified, and other useful implementations exist like 'applying core functions as the base similarities on the similarity index network', where 'variables of these implementations' include interface structures like 'requirements' such as 'interfaces occupying different positions/directions/structures rather than overlapping'

    - identify useful structures like 'error structures of solution structures like solution metrics' to identify useful structures like 'other errors resulting from an error like an over-prioritized solution metric' and 'solution structures of solution structures like "balanced solution metrics"'
        - for example, 'efficiency' (as in 'both speed/accuracy') is a 'balanced set of solution metrics (like speed/accuracy)', which identifies 'balanced multi-functionality' as the abstract form that is generally useful but also identifies 'errors of solutions like prioritization errors of solution metrics' as useful to identify, where 'balanced sets of solution metrics' are useful solution structures
        - relatedly, identifying a 2-d graph of the highest variation variables is a useful intent to identify "interactions of variables (like 'volatility') with a common base (like 'variation/potential')" or 'volatility/validity, compared to a related base network', since most of these variables can be reduced to a comparison to some adjacent/base structure
        - relatedly, identifying the differences in value of different formats is useful like how 'similarity indexes' are useful for identifying 'degree/type of difference' and 'graphing according to the same common base' is useful for identifying 'unexpected similarities like overlaps, once standardized to the same base (identifying degree/type of difference from other similarities and degree of difference from the same standardized similarity)'
        - relatedly, 'change a base solution' is useful when 'applied to standardized base solutions in the same base' which maximizes its power, since the intent is to find a useful new difference which is more powerful in a more standardized structure
        - relatedly, the concept of 'power/balance/independence queries' vs. 'relevance/useful/meaning queries' is a useful interaction to identify, to identify useful variants of problem-solving intents like 'queries to create independence to solve problems' which 'creates relevance of independence by connecting it to generative variables' (given that independence can be used to solve problems like by isolating variables and applying independent variables like interfaces)

    - identify useful structures like intents such as 'apply differences to relevant structures' which are useful abstractions of workflows like 'change a base solution' to identify the 'meaning/relevance of interface queries' through applying interface structures like abstractions as 'relevant differences to apply to interface structures like interface queries' (meaning an 'abstraction is a relevant difference' and its useful to identify the relevant differences of core similarities like problem/solution connection structures such as workflows or like interface definitions)
        - for example, applying a 'relevant difference in a similarity' is related to applying a 'change to a base solution' (the difference is relevant bc of the core similarity expected between the new/base solution), which indicates that 'relevance interface structures' are a useful source of workflows
        - similarly, 'trial and error' applies a 'relevant difference in the similarity' in the 'similarity between "variables of generated possible solutions" and the "actual solution/its variables"' (the solution is expected to be in the set of generated possible solutions so there is a similarity), where the 'relevant difference in the similarity' is in the function changing those variables used to generate the solution, since the variables dont have enough info or the correct info to identify the solution just from the variables
        - this applies interface structures like 'differences like abstractions' to relevance structures like 'relevant differences', to create different types of interface queries like 'queries that use relevance to connect other structures (like connecting relevant problems)' rather than 'connecting other structures to create relevance between the original problem/solution' (rather than standardizing relevance to the similarity/difference interface to simplify interface queries, apply similarities/differences to relevance thereby standardizing problems to relevance, since relevance is a useful abstraction to apply changes to and connect to other structures), which means query intents like 'connect relevant types like relevant problems', 'identify relevant similarities/differences' and 'identify position on relevance spectrum' can be combined/connected to create other 'relevance interface queries' like 'identify a relevant as in "new" difference similarity as in a "difference type" on a relevant structure like a "standard, such as a relevance spectrum" when relevant as in "existing" structures arent relevantly (like "sufficiently") relevant as in "useful for solving the problem with relevant resources"' (which identifies useful positions/structures to apply relevance variables in, to make that query general and useful in other problems)
        - relatedly, identifying useful structures like 'trivial indicators/reductions/filters' of relevance structures is a useful general problem-solving intent, just like identifying a 'meaning/relevance similarity index' is useful to identify 'interface queries/structures with similar/relevant meanings/relevance'
        - relatedly, identifying 'maps of independent variables like abstractions and efficiencies' is useful to standardize these structures to the meaning/relevance interface (where abstractions arent always an efficiency structure, so identifying this mapping is useful given that its not a complete equivalence)
        - I identified this when I thought about how a change applied to a problem is useful to apply to a similar problem but not a solution, bc of the connection between problem/solution which would be altered/invalidated if the 'change from the original problem' was applied across types to the solution, bc the relevant structures to the problem define its meaning and therefore the 'meaning/relevance would also change, not just the original problem difference' if the problem difference was applied to a solution, which is true bc a 'difference in a context' has a different meaning than a 'difference' and these differences cant be isolated, so identifying a 'meaning network' (defining the problem's meaning) is the useful structure to apply in connections (within types or other relevant similarities), so identifying the meaning changes of a difference applied in a position is useful to identify possible errors of (like 'applying a difference within a type to avoid changing the type or changing the meaning'), although there are some differences that can be applied across structures generally like 'increasing the definition of a structure' which can be applied to both problems/solutions in a useful way bc of the general usefulness of the 'filter' intent that is helped by 'definitions', then I connected it to workflows and identified that relevance structures were connected to different workflows, which is related to how workflows encode a core similarity/difference structure
        - relatedly, 'independent/additive/compounding relevance' are particularly useful 'differences in a similarity' and also 'differences from similarities (independence being the opposite of connection/relevance in some ways)' to identify
        - relatedly, the best solutions to medical problems are often 'trivial changes of existing resources (like a variant of a vitamin or a format of a vitamin or a different species of an herb that is already used or a different ratio of a substance like electrolytes/acid)' given that the 'differences required to create the medical condition' are trivial and the 'differences required to correct the problem differences' are similarly trivial, which matches the variation of the problem/solution, these trivial differences being implementable with a 'difference in structure as in a new structure' or a 'difference in ratio of existing structures', which is also true bc the 'system is primed to handle these trivially different substances better than other substances, when these trivial differences dont intersect with error positions' (its true for multiple reasons), which identifies intents like 'identify similarly adjacent changes and identify which of these oppose each other to find solution/error sets in trivial changes' and 'identify when multiple changes of the same type create the same structure vs neutralizing each other with some ratio/structure of difference/opposition'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify the difference/similarity structures involved in identify 'other problems to solve' like how solving 'very independent/maximally different problems and very similar problems' can help with a problem more so than the interim problems, partly bc of dynamics involving variables like 'scale' such as how solving a 'very core/composable/unitary or a very similar problem' is useful, but other scales arent as likely to be useful with those functions (compose, trivially differ, invalidate, approximate) but would rather require other functions to be identified
        - relatedly, identifying variables of interface structures is useful (like 'change a line/point of a symmetry into an area/line allowing a broader definition and embedding another interface in the base interface', etc) to identify other variants of interfaces, interface interactions, and other interface structures

    - identify useful structures like 'variables like generality/volatility that can be "based on or implemented by or used by" a core workflow function like connect/reduce' that are useful for filtering interface queries (rather than trying each query in some set of interface queries, check which queries "add maximally different variables like generality/volatility" to a "connection between problem/solution" and which use the core workflow function 'connect', to identify more useful connections that support more variables)
        - for example, identifying 'structures like connections that support additional variables/differences (like both volatility/generality)' is useful as a general intent to fulfill intents like 'identify problem-solving connections' (problem/solution connections), similar to how identifying 'connections that can be used for multiple specific intents/functions' is useful
        - I identified this by thinking about how blockchains 'oppose/reduce an uncertainty' in a 'transaction connection' using a new encryption structure, thereby 'adding a variable of "security" to the connection by making it more stable/constant so it can support more variation', so 'identifying structures to oppose/reduce a variable/uncertainty/difference by adding variables to the connection/reduction like generality/volatility to create opposing structures of variables like constants' is a useful example of the general intent ('connect different structures like variation/uncertainty with constants/certainty "using or by implementing" generality/volatility' and 'reduce excess structures like gaps/over-prioritizations "using or by implementing" generality/volatility'), which specifies an 'interface implementation (like the abstract/change interface), implemented with a core workflow function like connect/reduce, applied to problem structures like uncertainties/over-prioritizations'
        - relatedly, 'identifying which variables like "connectivity/reducibility" oppose/connect/reduce/support/otherwise interact with which variables (uncertainty/certainty, generality, volatility, complexity, independence, etc)' is a general way to identify what specific solution metrics/structures or solution-finding metrics/structures would be useful to solve a problem and which problem/solution metrics/structures are directly connectible/reducible ('solve a problem of "uncertainty" by connecting it to opposing structures like constant/security/limit/definition/requirement/organization structures to "reduce the uncertainty" using a variable like "generality" that can support "extreme opposites" with which to implement the "uncertainty reduction"' or specifically, 'solve an uncertainty between opposing structures by applying opposites like generality/specificity')

    - identify useful structures like 'variables of prioritization filters of interface queries' like 'interface errors' like 'suboptimal resource usage/organization or lack of requirements enforcement' which are useful to correct as a 'more determining variable to prioritize that also applies an optimization structure like a core problem-solving workflow'
        - for example, identifying the 'sequence of interfaces/bases' in a system and solving the problems of the interfaces/bases first is a useful priority to filter interface queries, such as how its useful to 'prevent variance in a constant by enforcing requirements or using the same copy for all requests' rather than 're-generating the constant every time its needed' since the problem is not the 'specific error in re-generating the constant' but in the 'systemic lack of enforcement of a constant', which creates a 'vulnerable position of a possible variance injection that can allow errors in a structure that shouldnt be allowed to vary', and solving the interface problem of 'enforcing requirements such as constants' is more useful than 'optimizing the specific process that relies on that base (which can have repeated errors bc its repeated unnecessarily)'
        - similarly, identifying the specific interface structures of interface structures that are useful is a useful general intent ('identify all the useful sequences/similarity indexes/bases/vertexes/structures of interface structures')
        - I thought of this when I realized that if a problem exists, its likely bc other problems are also present, in which case its useful to identify the causal problem (like a processes that directly increases the probability of errors in other dependent processes) or co-occurring problems (like a problem of excess resource usage that indirectly prevents using resources to solve another problem), which can be generalized to 'solving the interface/base problem' since these are likelier to be more valuable to solve bc theyll likely cause other errors if not solved, so the workflow is 'identifying a related co-occurring/causal problem involving interface structures like requirements and solve those problems first' which is useful bc the errors in interface definitions will have a higher impact than other structures if allowed to have errors, and which avoids correcting specific/irrelevant/output errors to avoid correcting more determining errors, which applies 'change a base solution' in a new way since 'changing the interfaces/bases of a system' overlaps with 'correcting errors in those interfaces/bases'
        - this means that 'prioritizing correcting interface errors first' applies 'change the most extreme base solution (as in the ultimate solution structure, interfaces, given the usefulness of interfaces as a general solution structure)', which applies an extreme to the variables of the workflow
            - similarly, applying 'trial and error' to a reduced solution set of 'only sets of interface structures' also applies an extreme to the workflow, like how 'identify new variables' applied to 'identify new interfaces' also applies an extreme to the workflow that can optimize its usefulness, given that these workflows are more powerful when applied to extreme/useful structures like interface structures
        - this is useful bc identifying what problems 'co-occur/cause each other/are relevant/connected' in a system such as 'given the lack of an optimization or an opposing/limiting structure' is useful to identify structures like 'trivial signals of specific problem sets' and 'impact of scaled/iterated problems' and 'solutions to problem sets/types/structures' and 'general interactions of problems such as systemic entropy or compounding errors'

    - identify useful structures like 'new ways to use concepts to solve problems' by identifying "new specifications/connections/applications of a solution function like 'isolate'" as useful to solve a problem like by 'connecting solution/error concepts'
        - for example, applying concepts like 'independence' can take the form of 'adding distance between the problem/solution' or 'removing the benefits of the problem by creating alternates of those benefits, so solution structures can be independent of it' rather than just 'isolating/containing the problem', to 'make a solution independent of a problem' in a new way, similar to how applying 'balance' can create more workflows like how 'balancing the problem/solution by making the problem better or making the solution the problem, or distributing errors equally or similarizing all problems' is one way to 'solve the problem by changing its comparative position to other structures like solutions', which basically makes a point that a 'concept can be used in infinite ways to solve a problem if sufficiently abstract', and even though the problem tends to be more well-defined than the solution at first, abstracting the problem to the highest variation similarities across problems as in 'error variables or error metrics' is useful since there are variables that are less optimal/useful than others, and 'changing the position of abstraction' to be the problem rather than the solution allows general workflows/queries/solutions to be identified
        - I was thinking about how 'isolating variables' is another useful simple intent (like 'identifying variables') and how isolating a problem from a solution can be done in many ways, isolation being a component of independence, and identified that "applying these solution metrics until a problem of 'over-prioritization of these solution metrics' occurs" is useful in general even if it doesnt connect to the original problem, however given the abstraction of these concepts, it likely will connect to the original problem since each abstract concept functions like an interface
        - relatedly, efficiency structures are often extremely dependent (like how 'finding an answer is efficient once an index already exists', which depends on the index) so 'identifying independent efficiencies' (like 'one structure that can be used to solve problems without other structures such as interfaces') is a useful problem-solving intent
            - similarly, 'identifying relevance efficiencies' is useful as a problem-solving intent like how 'adding real/realistic structures makes a structure more relevant'
            - this is related to the core problem-solving function of 'connect' which makes meaning/relevance structures useful by default, which means examples of relevance structures that are useful for connections like 'dependencies' are useful by default ('dependencies' can be 'sequenced by cause' to fulfill a 'connect' function), but independence structures are also useful as 'generally relevant structures like interfaces', similar to how 'invalidating an interface is a way to solve a problem' just like 'both errors and solutions are useful to identify solutions', which indicates that 'identifying independent structures like generally relevant/useful structures' is an alternate to a workflow like 'connect a specific problem/solution'
        - relatedly, identifying core structures is useful for various workflows like 'apply core structures until a previous solution state is reached, then apply core structures until the problem or its first indicator occurs', which identifies the 'creation/replication of the problem' as useful to identify, which indicates other workflows like 'try to create this problem from various solution metric structures like accuracy/generality/validity and from error structures like complexity/volatility' which should be useful as a way to connect the problem to other problems/solutions and therefore identify connected structures like 'solutions to similar problems which are useful to try', these connections between solution/error variables being generally useful to identify useful structures like connections of
        - relatedly, applying 'complexity structures' like 'hidden info/overlaps between variables' that are often applied as problems to solutions instead, is a way to make solutions 'stronger/more stable than problems'
        - relatedly, some solution metric structures like 'tradeoffs' should be applied in a structure like an 'alternating sequence' like how 'accuracy' can be applied when resources are available to create it (when accuracy creating/determining functions are available and when speed optimization opportunities exist) and 'speed optimizations' can be looked for when opportunities for those optimizations exist to make 'speed' the more useful solution metric to apply (there will be a threshold above which the faster algorithm is better to apply, once those speed optimization opportunities are fulfilled), and while the algorithm is 'identifying quicker/more accurate methods by reaching better understanding'
        - relatedly, identifying what is 'possible to predict with im/perfect understanding' is useful, such as how 're-applying structures like incentives to a new problem space' makes 'normal/common structures possible to predict with one insight about the reusability/generality of some insights'
        - identifying solutions to 'perception errors' like 'lack of an interpretation/translation/usage function for a structure' is useful for intents like 'filtering interface queries', to identify query optimizations like 'distribute functions at maximally different positions' which can offset errors like 'perception errors from angles where info is hidden'
        - identifying a 'similarity index network' can describe interface connections but a more useful graph would be where 'meaning overlaps' occur across interfaces, so that structures having the same meaning on different interfaces overlap at some angle, which would be a 'meaning/relevance similarity index network' and would help filter interface queries which also 'connect interface structures according to meaning'

    - identify useful structures like 'comparison/connection/reduction variables' that havent yet been applied to connect to relevance, like how 'comparisons to concepts like independence/relevance' havent been used but are useful to identify as a general problem-solving intent, as opposed to a normal workflow in a typical problem like 'regression' where a 'set of solutions is compared to an identified ratio like an "error threshold" based on a simple well-defined solution metric' which doesnt describe every problem or workflow, which is why applying variables to comparisons is useful
        - for example, identifying that comparison/connection/similarity structures can be more complex than a 'comparison to one simple structure' is useful, to identify other useful comparison structures, like a 'network that makes all comparisons trivial' like a 'similarity index network', so that 'comparisons to a base network' and 'comparisons between networks' and 'comparison to independence/relevance' (given that independent variables are the most complex variable interactions through allowing the most variation, and that all more dependent variable interactions are more trivial to determine, so prioritizing identifying independence interactions is useful to check if the problem involves maximally independent variables first, and 'comparisons to relevance structures' are default useful comparisons by definition since connecting variables to relevance/usefulness is required to solve a problem)
        - relatedly, identifying that 'identified variables' are often applied as a 'base network to compare to' is useful to identify other networks like 'networks of generated functions (being useful as a default function set to apply)' and 'iterated requirements/intents (where emergent intents invalidate intents in the iteration)', applying core functions to interface structures to identify useful structures like 'networks' of new interactions to apply as components in workflows, similar to how applying 'alternates' as in 'alternating variables' leads to 'alternating variation/constant structures' which are useful for filtering interface queries, and similar to how 'isolating variables' are another structure that is useful to specify as a problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying invalidations of comparisons like 'optimization networks that make any structure useful' are useful to identify as well and apply as 'opposites/limits of comparisons, used to determine the relevance of a comparison'
        - relatedly, identifying different networks like 'base networks to apply changes to (suboptimality/solution networks)' and 'base networks to compare to (truth networks)' are useful as different networks to vacillate between or otherwise connect in workflows like 'change a base solution' and 'filter solutions by useful differentiating variables like validity using truth/validity networks'
        - relatedly, identifying that some variables are 'defined as relevant or otherwise required to connect to for a particular problem' is useful, such as how its always useful to identify how a medical condition relates to 'hormones' since those are 'primary change-inputs of other variables' and without that identification, a condition is likely to be incompletely understood, so when solving a bio-system problem, 'identifying variable connections to hormones' is a 'required intent' to fulfill to solve the problem, given this 'identified useful/required variable', so other problem-solving processes can be applied in connection to this required intent but it shouldnt be skipped unless its covered by another intent
        - relatedly, identifying 'useful differences to apply in a structure like a set' is useful, such as how the usefulness of 'adding a vitamin' for intents like 'reduce inflammation' may be increased by applying it right after 'triggering a vitamin deficiency' as opposed to any time, bc the 'response to the vitamin' such as 'de-prioritizing inflammation in order to process the prioritized vitamin in a deficiency state' will likely be different in that case, which identifies 'applying variation to default/required/constant structures' as a useful intent to make constants more useful than they otherwise would be

    - identify useful structures like 'relevant differences' that can be varied like 'specified' in a useful new way like 'relevant opposites of interfaces' for useful intents like 'invalidate interfaces'
        - for example, 'reverse time' and 'change base' and 'invalidate requirements' are all 'relevant opposites/differences of interfaces' which are useful as 'intents to base workflows on', 'invalidating interfaces by opposing interfaces' being an alternative to 'changing/switching or adding interfaces'
        - relatedly, applying abstractions like 'self-references' to interface structures (as in 'applying abstract intra-interface structures') like 'standardize standards' and 'define requirements (as in "specify general intents")' connect these interfaces to the 'interface/meaning' interface through the 'interactivity' of these combinations which results in a 'higher ratio of coverage of reality' that necessarily interacts with meaning as well 
        - I was thinking about how remaining unsolved problems include 'connecting function specificity types' like 'connect vs. reverse vs. add', thought about how to connect these more specific functions to interfaces, identified 'reversing time' as a way to solve problems (as in 'reverting to a previous state where the problem was reduced or not present'), identified a connection to a workflow like 'change a base solution' through a common opposition of the interface structure that is relevant to its definition ('reverse' is a relevant difference to the sequential definition of 'time', 'change' is a relevant difference since 'bases' are defined to support change) (which identifies a source of new workflows, 'applying relevant differences to interfaces'), then identified how invalidating an interface is similarly useful as changing/adding an interface, and identified that these 'relevant oppositions as invalidations of interfaces' could be connected to the interface interface with abstractions like self-reference structures (which provides a way to identify new filters of interface queries, 'filter interface queries by connecting structures to the interface interface using self-references and other abstractions'), and identified why this is possible (bc the higher interactivity of the intra-interface structures connects these interactions to the interface interface by default bc of a higher coverage of reality of these abstract intra-interface interactions)

    - identify useful structures like 'errors in connections to relevance structures, especially abstract connections like with "abstract similarities" that often form the base of solution automation workflows' which are useful to filter interface queries by avoiding these errors
        - for example, identifying how 'similarities can connect to relevance by creating relevance structures like "connections to errors"' like how 'repeated (as in too many) repetitions create incentives for false positive feedback' and 'repetitions (as in backups) applied with variations to test the interactions with repetitions are useful in providing examples of errors' indicating that 'similarity structures (like repetitions) can create opposite structures when applied with different interface structures like self-reference structures, extremes/over-prioritizations or variations/tests' is useful with workflows that apply 'abstract similarity' structures to avoid errors with the base concept driving a workflow which are the most useful to avoid
        - this can be applied as general rules in interface queries like 'avoid creating an error by over-applying a structure', 'create an opposite of a solution or error by "over-applying a structure" or "testing a repetition with variation"', and 'identify differences in contexts where similarities in those contexts can create differences in relevance (like where an over-repeated similarity creates "false positive feedback incentives" and where a repetition for testing with variation creates "obvious errors that are trivial to identify/correct")'
        - relatedly, identifying some simple connections between sets of interface structures like 'interactivity/requirements' is possible such as how 'increases in interactivity create increases in requirements' (except in connections/intersections with the interface network, like when other interface structures intervene to make interactivity a requirement-invalidating or fulfilling structure to decrease requirements)
            - this insight of 'increasing interactivity increases requirements' has another way to identify it that is very simple like 'supporting more variation like "more coordinating different structures on the same base" is more complex (except when interface structures are applied)', similar to how 'apply the definition of relevance in a new way' and 'identifying variables of common structures such as their interactivity' are different ways to identify interactivity as useful and also indicate different workflows, indicating that there are variants like a 'interface/standard/relevance variant' of a workflow (as opposed to 'applying a specific interface structure like common/interactive structures in different contexts until a new connection to other interface structures like interactivity/requirements is identified') bc these are different 'bases of variation' and connecting these variants of workflows is useful as a 'workflow similarity network' to apply in workflows like 'identify similar workflows to use when one is identified as suboptimal (change a base workflow)'
        - relatedly, variants of workflows like 'change a base solution' include 'change the same base solution like interface structures', which can be a required or prioritized workflow since its more useful to 'identify new ways to use interface structures' than to apply other intents as this will solve other intents
        - relatedly, other simple connections to relevance structures can be derived like how 'extreme differences indicate usage structures' whereas 'extreme similarities indicate variants'

    - identify useful structures like 'errors (like errors of "lack of specificity" such as "unspecified positions") of standardized structures' like how its useful to apply 'specification' to the 'position' of 'variables of queries on the similarity index network' or apply 'specification' to the 'variables like sequence/linearity' of 'graphs connecting 2-d specific/general variables'
        - for example, its useful to identify specific relevance interface structures like 'relevance units' like 'counts of continuous/sequential or complementary/unique queries on a "similarity index network or a sequence of 2-d specific graphs"'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify connections between 'different ways to identify determining variables like "interactivity"' like 'apply the definition of "relevance" to identify structures of it like "structures that are useful for multiple intents" like "intersections between high ratios of structures" which abstracts to "interactions"' (applying a workflow based on relevance like 'how can relevance be used to identify new structures') vs. 'identifying that common structures are also highly interactive' (applying a workflow based on an insight like the 'probable connectivity/similarity to base structures' like 'which structures have other variables') as a way of 'identifying new workflows' by identifying 'new abstract bases for change' like 'relevance' and 'existing useful structures'
        - relatedly, its useful to identify 'structures to connect 2-d specific/general variables' like 'overlaps/layering for standardization based on similar positions across graphs, similarity indexes, and parameterization' to reduce the connection requirements and the solution search space, where these 2-d specific graphs can be required to be more linear (meaning their base variables are so adjacent to the output variable as to indicate equivalence with some simple function) to allow for variation to connect the 2-d specific/general graphs more trivially, although some of these variables or the connecting variables between the 2-d specific/general graphs will have specific defined counts/ratios in their definitions ('volatility' having a defined base of 'comparison of local change to non-local change' indicating a 'high distance indicating maximal value differences between local and non-local changes on a similarity index network' indicating the determining variable of volatility is the 'starting position/partition of changes that determine that non-local/local changes are to be compared' and therefore the 'distance to traverse trivially, like using one function, on the similarity index network to get from one slope to another maximally different slope'), which indicates that 'variables (like distance traversed, from some specific starting point, or crossing some specific point) of queries on the similarity index network' are useful in determining 2-d specific graphs and their connections to 2-d general graphs, which makes it more trivial to determine general 2-d graphs like intersections (such as similarities between similarity index network variables of a set of general variables like abstraction/potential) on the 2-d general graph, where its useful to identify 'variants of similarities with low reducibility like interactivity' that are likely to be useful as bases of the similarity index network, rather than applying similarities as 'abstract connections', instead requiring specific similarity identities like 'interactivity' on the similarity index network with specific positions/other structures, after which specifications can be applied until all problems can be solved with trivial queries on this graph/similarity network
        - relatedly, identifying all relevance structures involves answering the specific question 'what should be compared' (to determine some equivalence/difference), such as how some simple variables like 'counts' are unlikely to be the optimal structure to base a comparison on for most problems partly bc theyre too easily determined (changing a count is too trivial, so comparing counts is unlikely to be useful, so 'comparing count distributions' and 'connecting different probable counts' are likelier to be useful)
            - similarly, the specific question 'what structure is likely to have some useful ratio of info reflection' has similar relevance to identifying all relevance structures (even if its incorrect, like parameterizing some 2-d specific variable like 'volatility' based on some structural variable like 'position across time' which is possible with some sequential change to some similarity index, which is incorrect bc not all relevant changes will be connectible in a continuous time sequence bc volatility can occur/be identified bc of probability and co-occurrence rather than time, so it will still reveal some other useful info, like which structures co-occur or synchronize in the same time sequence), which is a problem of "identifying structures like graphs to iterate parameters of to 'make it trivial to identify whether some ratio of the graph is correct or whether some other info is correct'" which can be implemented with structures like high variation variables (as in 'use graphs of high variation variables to make sure any difference identified is useful')

    - identify useful structures like useful variables to connect like 'workflows/standards' and related structures like 'intents fulfilled by those structures' to 'filter interface queries' by identifying 'positions of variation' like the variation contained in the intent 'identify queries relevant to a standard' which is derivable as a remaining useful requirement once 'identify relevant standards to a problem/solution' is implemented/applied
        - 'connecting workflows to standards' is useful such as how 'change a base solution' fulfills 'apply a different standard' which is useful to identify, since there are other standards that can be usefully changed to solve a problem,  so that its clear when a problem likely requires 'differences in relevance (such as differences in standards)' such as 'abstracting a problem/solution until a standard is identified that contains both, or identify overlapping abstractions of problems/solutions' and 'identifying a new absolute standard' (like solution metrics, definitions, standard variables like standard position, etc) or 'identifying new structures like "limits" on the variables like the "range" of a standard', similar to how other workflows 'apply a function to standards' like how 'adding a standard' can be a useful workflow where there is a missing opposing structure like a 'filter/limit' of a structure like 'generate/change' and where 'selecting a value within a specific range' is useful, which makes it useful to define that range by identifying an opposing structure like an error/limit/filter to identify a limit to define the range where solutions are likely
            - relatedly, queries like 'identify relevant standards, identify how different this problem is from a standard, identify how different this problem should be from a standard, and identify how to connect those differences from a standard' (abstracted to 'identify relevant standards as in "standards similar to the problem/solution", identify problem/solution differences from those relevant standards, and identify similarizations/connections to resolve those differences') simplify the query filtering so that 'identifying relevant standards' is the primary problem to solve in most interface queries, requiring implementations such as 'identifying which standards have relevant variation to the problem/solution', after which point the remaining related intents are likely intents like 'apply queries relevant to this standard, once the relevant standard is identified'
        - relatedly, identify 'core error structures of high variation variables' like 'variation/validity traps (where variation/validity are opposed)' given that these are the most useful variables to apply as 'standards to base changes on' and solutions to them are useful to apply in sequences (applying validity/possibility filters first) and as vertexes (applying potential new validity to existing validity) and are useful to identify similarities/overlaps between (identifying overlaps between variation/validity traps and their solutions as default query filters), and relatedly connecting these high variation variables is useful to identify connections to base changes on (connections between volatility/sensitivity, rather than connections between inputs/bases of volatility like a volatility function would describe), and iterating this is similarly useful (identifying networks/grids/fields/embeddings where volatility and its connected variables and networks of these variables are defined at more points in more ways until the primary abstract interfaces or other interfaces emerge from these variable connections like 'volatility' which is a specific 'change' interface variable defined like 'extreme/adjacent output/input change'), which is a useful way to solve the problem of "identifying the structures like intersections/limits/similarities/connections between spectrums like generic/specific and constant/variation", as opposed to identifying 'variants of definitions of these variables when interacting' to describe this graph of spectrums
        - relatedly, 'automating through filtering/specifying' as opposed to 'automating through structuring' or 'automating through changing' or 'automating through increasing interactivity/organization/standardization/connectivity' are useful to identify as related but different intents, where 'automating through structuring' is seen as the default method of automation, where these intents have coordinating vertexes like 'filter/generate' and 'evaluate/filter' which specify useful connections to apply as default query filters
        - relatedly, identifying vertexes that reduce the 'graph of intersecting interface spectrums like specific/generic' to a point on a graph network (reducing the clusters to a point) is useful as a general problem-solving intent (answering 'what is sufficiently independent of the spectrums to invalidate/cross them with few variables, such as the "variation of queries from a standard that is frequently useful in query sequences"'), where this graph is useful mostly as a way to graph problem-solving query patterns like 'vacillations between constant/variation'
            - relatedly, 'selecting maximally different structures' and 'apply differences/opposites to identify limits' are other similar intents that identify 'vacillating between extremes of a spectrum like constants/variation' as useful across problem-solving queries, indicating once again that 'overlapping intents can be applied as base queries'
            - a more useful graph than this spectrum intersection graph is likely to be a graph of sets of interface structures with some ratio of specifications

    - identify useful structures like "comparisons that allow 'simple functions like iterations such as counts'" to be applied to solve most problems, like comparisons in 'required variation, required relevance, and interface structure intersections on a graph of interface variables', to allow simplified interface queries using that graph like 'identify the variation required to connect these relevant variables, and identify the number of interface variable intersections to fulfill that level of variation'
        - for example, counting the 'number of defined/adjacent intersections/limits/other interface structures with different structures with some ratio/type/structure of difference (like interface structures have)' is a good proxy for complexity, which is one of the more countable interface variables, where these intersections/limits/other structures occur on the 'graph of interface variable structures like spectrums', given that the low-dimensional reduction indicating the core similarities that create complexity is 'independent differences that nevertheless interact more than other variables, given that interactive structures are useful to create differences, such as self-reference/recursion structures or structures that intersect with extremes/limits, which overlap with reality-covering variables like interface variables'
        - identifying a countable interface structure is useful for identifying linearizations/polynomializations of interface structures, to identify structures like 1-to-1 mappings/limits/overlaps/angles/other structures and their useful variants, which drastically simplifies interface queries
        - when a problem cant be standardized to an identifiable/identified simplifying base variable, identifying the resolutions to those complexity structures will help filter interface queries (to identify filters like 'when the problem isnt just comparing standardized values indicating that its resolvable with an angle/distance/ratio, add an iteration to apply other functions to find their connecting standards or add a network around each of the problem/solution structures to identify other connections that are standardizable')
        - relatedly, 'cross-interface embedded vertexes' like 'low complexity, high generality' (which embeds a math interface standard structure of 'relative value ratio (low/high)' on an abstract vertex like 'complexity/generality' which is a cross-interface structure) are an example of 'standards intersections', and 'identifying these standards intersections' also "identifies structures likely to be countable/otherwise highly structural to solve problems like 'identify new useful variation'"
        - relatedly, the reason why intersections between interface structures are so useful is that they 'identify positions/structures where high ratios of variation can occur' (as in 'multiple high variation structures can coordinate in/be valid in/occupy the point of the intersection') and that theyre 'useful to connect extremely independent structures like interface variables', which is why these intersections and related structures are the new base of reality (a higher variation base of useful structures)

    - identify useful structures like 'error structure connections and error/solution specifications and relevant opposite connections' and their useful interactions like their 'overlaps/connections/variants' which can identify useful structures like the 'generalizations of their useful connections' like 'connections between error interface structures and the required/defined overlaps of these connections with some ratio of solution structures' and the 'degree of difference in interface structures required to solve most problems' like the connection between different structures like 'error variants, error causes, and error/solution connection specifications'
        - for example, identifying 'possible error/solution connections' is useful to identify such as 'error/solution specifications (like damage/recovery) and ratios connecting those specifications (like damage/recovery ratios like equivalences)' and once identified, are useful to apply as default problem-solving structures like 'where a problem/subproblem is a point on the connection below the ratio required for optimality', these error/solution connections being useful as 'spectrums to navigate when the solution structure involves a ratio required for optimality', and are useful to connect to identified problem structures (as in 'connect problem variables/their definitions/variants/ranges/interface structures to other useful structures like identified structures like ratios of specified error/solution connections', such as by identifying how 'error outputs like error signals' like symptoms can also be an 'error input to problems like conditions/symptoms' if the error signals' connections/interim structures around the error signals they create cause structures like 'damage' relevant to an error/solution connection like 'damage/recovery ratios', which involves identifying a lack of requirement for an error signal to only be an error signal and nothing else, where its possible for it to also be similar to its opposites such as inputs, where connecting opposites like errors/solutions and inputs/outputs are useful across problems)
        - this identifies an interface query like the following:
            - 'apply variation to identified structures like error signals (to identify its other useful definition variants in its interactions with other useful structures like error/solution connections)' 
                - which will identify 'changes in between the error signal input and the error signal, which can include changes that cause solution/error connection structures like damage'
            - 'identify useful connections between relevant opposites like solutions/errors which are different variants of optimality' 
                - 'apply variation such as specification to solution/error connections to identify "damage/recovery ratios required for optimality" like "damage/recovery equivalence"'
            - 'connect the variation identified (connect definition variants of error signals like other structures an error signal can be such as a "damage cause", and solution/error structure variants like specifications, to identify interactions of "error signals and solution/error connections" like how "error signals can cause other errors like damage specifically")
        - this is a variant of a workflow like 'apply changes to problems/solution structures until theyre connectible' that identifies a new useful structure like a 'error/solution connection such as a specific error/solution connection' as well as identifying useful new intents like 'identifying similarities/connections like "both involving error structures, which provide a general default connection between problems/solutions to apply to filter interface queries" in similarities/connections of differences like relevant opposites (error variants and error/solution connections)' as a general problem-solving intent which applies other useful problem-solving intents like 'connect problems to useful structures like interactive structures and connect useful structures to solution structures, applying useful structures as an organizing interface/base/network for problems/solutions'
        - this identifies problem-solving intents like 'connect different error interface structures (like error variants or interim structures of errors or other uses of errors or error/solution connections) so that solution structures are more determinable/connectible to this high variation error network'
        - this can be extended by applying specifications like 'identifying structures on the solution/error connection interface, such as structures that can be applied as barriers preventing navigating a specific error/solution connection to cross the optimality ratio like "barriers to damage/recovery equivalence"' and identifying structures implementing those specifications like how 'error signals can be applied as other error structures like these barriers to optimality'
        - this workflow would identify an error like where a 'problem output like a symptom causes/requires problems that take up the variation/free parameters of a system to oppose the error as in recover from the error, protecting error causes from damage by default, given that free parameters are required to prevent error causes' meaning the 'problem output requires variation that would otherwise go to fixing the error cause which also requires variation to fix', so 'invalidating the problem output requirement for variation is required to solve the other problem of the error cause'

    - identifying the relevance of 'patterns like "constant/variable alternations" in workflows/queries' is useful to identify 'inputs to those patterns like constant meanings' as useful inputs to workflows like 'identify constants to vary to identify other optimals (a generalization of change a base solution)'
        - for example, identifying useful 'interface structures of meaning' like 'constant meanings' is useful, like 'some structure that always means the same thing' such as how the 'meaning of many interactions' is 'false value/virtues/meaning such as "wanting some connection to be true without identifying a way to make it true and applying a false way to make it seem true"', where the fact that this 'always' applies to the meaning of some interaction types/sources/structures is valuable to identify (converting this high variation variable into a constant computed meaning), so that this structure can be applied to always generate the same relevance, which is useful to apply as a node in a network of similarly constant relevance structures as a 'base solution' to apply changes to
        - relatedly, identifying 'generally irrelevant and specifically relevant' is useful as an abstraction of 'generally false and specifically true' applied to relevance structures which is useful to identify relevant structures to interface queries/workflows such as structures like 'similarity/difference structures of interface structures like abstraction of meaning', given the usefulness of applying variables to relevance structures
        - relatedly, 'creating meaning without changing some generally useful meanings which are useful to keep constant' is useful as a workflow, given that 'extreme meaning changes' are often useful like how 'identifying a pattern/type/concept' reduces the meaning of some structure to an 'example of that pattern/type/concept', which means avoiding useful structures like 'meaning changes' is non-trivial/difficult and would be useful if possible to avoid (avoiding changing meaning such as by creating meaning, such as by identifying inputs to meaning and converting structures to relevant structures by connecting them to these inputs to meaning)
        - relatedly, 'change a base solution' should ideally be applied to 'interfaces' which are more generally useful to apply changes to, being the most stable/constant structures that support the most variation, so that 'applying this workflow to a structure that becomes more useful, the more changes are applied to it' is a way of identifying interfaces
        - relatedly, 'attempts at matrix linearization by methods like solving as a system of linear equations' as an example of why 1-to-1 mappings are useful/valuable/rare, bc there are likely many illusions of one-function 'solutions' to many interpretations of matrixes even when it involves so many steps and is so specific that it would seem like there would be only one solution to an interpretation like a 'system of linear equations', bc there isnt 'one possible interpretation/application/meaning of a matrix', and a 'network of these adjacent interpretations/applications/meanings' of a high variation structure like a 'matrix' is likelier to be more useful than trying to reduce it to a constant meaning that is 'always equal to some one-variable definition like an interface structure', although there are 'generally relevant' interpretations of a matrix like "applying it as a 'set of lines that interact with other multiplied matrix through intersections with the lines of the multiplier matrix' as a way to identify the structural meaning of a matrix" and like 'value embeddings in a structure that indicate "iterated sequences of multiplications" (like how a row in one matrix should be repeatedly multiplied by however many columns are in another matrix, where position indicates relevance of multipliers)'
        - relatedly, 'abstract' does not mean 'equal to anything' but rather 'connectible to anything'

    - identify useful structures like 'patterns in optimal usage intents' of useful structures like 'workflows' which are trivial to identify, once some structures like 'interface structures like similarities/variables/networks/variants of relevance structures like relevance/interfaces/connections/problems/similarities' are identified
        - for example, identifying the 'interface structures of meaning' like the 'variables that can change meaning the most' or 'variables with the most potential meaning' (such as interfaces) is useful to identify optimizations to interface queries and other structures of meaning
        - similarly, identifying the 'interface structures of connections' such as the 'ways that a connection can be true/false' and the 'network of valid variants of a connection' and the 'network of required coordinating structures like vertexes of a connection' are useful to identify and identify similarities like overlaps between, similar to how identifying similarities of a problem to truth structures is a useful interface structure of a problem to identify
        - these 'structures which its useful to identify interface structures of' are useful as structures to base changes on to identify other bases like similarities to apply changes to, which identifies 'change a base solution' as having a pattern in its optimal implementation (use it to identify similarities across solutions and similarities to other interface structures, then re-apply the workflow to apply more changes until more similarities are identified) these 'patterns in optimal usage intents' being useful structures to identify for all workflows/queries/interfaces/useful structures
        - 'apply changes to interface structures to find new similarities/differences' is useful as a variant of the workflow until new interface structures like 'iterated interface structures' are identified and applied as components/bases/inputs of workflows

    - identify useful structures like 'workflow abstractions' such as 'connecting similarities to useful/relevance structures' which can be used to generate other useful structures like 'workflow variants'
        - for example, its useful to identify that interface queries can be filtered in other ways, like formatting them as 'queries to identify similarities of problem structures to useful structures (like specific interface structures such as truth structures) which are likely to be useful as "inputs/implementations" of a core function like "change" in a workflow like "change a base solution"', and then 'queries to identify similarities between those useful structures and solution structures like solution metrics' to connect those problem/useful/solution structures in a sequence, applying 'connect differences using similarities' by applying 'change a base solution' (change the problem to a useful structure, then change the useful structure to a solution structure), which first requires 'identifying inputs to change such as the problem/useful structures'
            - specifically, this could involve a query like 'identify problem structure similarities to useful structures like truth structures (identify true problem variable connections), then identify similarities to other useful structures like relevance structures ("identify the useful problem variable similarities to truth structures" and "identify similarities between these useful similarities to truth/relevance and workflows, to resolve problem-solving intents" like "resolve remaining differences to solution metrics with connections", "similarities between useful similarities and workflows" such as the intent "identify remaining differences to resolve between 'these similarities in problem/useful structures' and 'solution metrics'", and the specific implementing intent "identify similarities between 'those remaining differences to resolve between useful/solution structures' and a 'workflow that can be applied to resolve those differences'"
            - this applies a general workflow of 'identify similarities to highly similar (as in abstract) structures like useful structures' and then 'similarize the output to the solution metrics using similarizing functions like specify'
        - I was thinking about a problem structure and then how it could be usefully converted into a more useful structure like a metadata or other network, then identified how connecting the problem to a truth structure like a 'true connection' is useful, which is a specific useful interface structure on the truth interface that it is useful to connect problems to, as a general problem-solving intent, and then abstracted it to identify how connecting problems to other specific interface structures like relevance/useful structures is generally useful to establish true connections to base changes on in a common workflow like 'change a base solution', then identified that 'similarities to useful interface structures' were a structure that applied across problem-solving workflows/queries/intents in general and that it is useful as an interim intent to fulfill a problem-solving intent like 'connect problem/solution' to abstract interface queries in general (find similarities to useful structures and the problem will be solved to some degree, since the connections between useful/solution structures will likely be similarly connectible or already connected by extrapolating definitions of useful/optimal structures to connect them in other workflows like by 'applying structure to generality/volatility'), which provides a different way to implement 'connect problem/solution' which is 'connect problem/solution by connecting problem/useful structures and connecting useful/solution structures' or 'connect problem/solution by connecting problem/truth structures and changing those true problem connections to be similar to solution structures'
        - relatedly to relevance structures, the 'human experience of time' requires 'perceiving sequential changes/connections as occurring', as opposed to 'perceiving sequential changes as compressed/flattened representations of information in a static field/grid/network' and 'perceiving/predicting sequences and avoiding/invalidating/reducing them (thereby compressing them into irrelevant unexperienced non-occurring non-existing sequences) or focusing on/validating them (expanding them into relevant real sequences) is similar to time travel', just like 'switching interfaces is like time travel' and 'identifying new high variation variables and their connections/sources/structures is like time travel' in that it crosses the static field/grid/network of compressed changes without experiencing/perceiving the trivial sequences but rather experiencing their 'emergent/net/aggregated/iterated/extreme/impactful/relevant representation' as in their 'meaning', and in perceiving these 'static fields/structures faster than the trivial changes in them can occur in a model of normal human time perception', time as in 'sequential or other similar/relevant structures' can be outpaced determined from a 'point that is relatively far ahead of other change types, a point where perceiving the meaning of the maximum high variation structures as static/instable/false/irrelevant is possible/trivial' so that 'any structure which can store/retrieve/query definitions and meanings of high variation structures may be able to determine time and should be applied as a risk-generating device' such as identifying that 'any technology should have a self-invalidation function built first to prevent the technology from determining time' (an identification that will increase undetermined time), where 'predicting/perceiving the correct future using structures like interfaces/graphs and applying variation in that perception and connecting that perception to other time perceptions' is similarly like time travel (thinking about what future people will need in a new static field/network/structure, which can be connected to the present with useful relevance like whether to avoid/enable these static structures or otherwise interact with them like by iterating or abstracting them and whether they are similar/connectible to other static structures to identify their absolute/ultimate/maximum relevance), and where 'interface dynamics' are useful to avoid determining time by building new interfaces concurrently with sequential time progression so that there is never a point where every structure is static, bc there is always a new interface being built to be a base for new/higher variation that cant be contained on other more static or lower variation interfaces so that time acts more like 'exponential steps on a spiral that never ends bc each step bases variation on a new interface' than a 'sequence of variation, a sequence that will be perceived as a constant from some other angle', and where 'perceiving all sequences as constants like by connecting all sequences to ways they can end time' is one way to determine time, similar to how 'identifying all possible timelines, their switching functions, and probabilities and other interface structures' is a way to determine time, and similarly 'identifying switching functions between interfaces' is a way to create time by connecting different timelines and making more functions reversible, similar to how 'creating an optimal organizer' is a way to create structures for time to occur on, similar to how 'creating entangled connections' is a way to 'connect unrelated/independent structures by forcing a false similarity to be true' at which point time (as in 'change sequences') will occur based on that new created connection, so creating quantum entanglements can create fragmented timelines where time shifts to a different time sequence based on the connection similar to how time can shift to a different interface if a choice is forced between a set of interfaces, and 'creating entanglements to connect interfaces permanently to ensure they can always be switched between' is a useful intent, and given that entanglements can change relevance structures by creating similarities/relevance between independent/irrelevant variables, they can also change optimal queries/graphs, which adds another variable to determine optimization and potential of an algorithm, so 'identifying entanglements that can change optimality of an algorithm in a useful way for various problem-solving intents' is useful, where creating some entangled connection, like other changes, has potential to change the meaning of other structures (making a false similarity temporarily true can oppose other similarities)
            - this is similar to how 'applying iterations until a structure emerges is like an expansion of time' (traveling through every iteration, with iterations as time units, assigning each iteration to a sufficient expansion to evaluate it, rather than representing it as a unit in a sequence)

    - identify useful structures like 'graph connections' like 'graphs connecting standards like error/solution sets' that are useful for problem-solving intents like 'identify relevance of solution metrics' which are useful to filter interface queries
        - identifying a graph like a 'polynomialization' of interface variables like 'a function of volatility by power/balance/absolute' is a way to identify 'possible functions of a high variation solution metric like volatility' (such as the highest variation as in powerful volatility, the most similar as in balanced volatility, the most volatile as in absolute volatility) that could be relevant to how volatility is structured like embedded in relatively independent functions of variables not directly related to volatility (the way that 'volatility changes according to power' is possibly relevant to how the 'volatility of other functions changes'), which identifies 'possible meanings of a polynomial' as being useful to connect to these 'possible high relevance interface variable pairs' in addition to connecting polynomials to descriptions of the 'embedded variables like volatility of a polynomial' to describe the possible meaning of a polynomial (how does a polynomial overlap/otherwise connect with solution metric polynomials and how does it create solution metric variables by providing a base to embed those variables in), which acts as a 'useful set of standards to apply as limits/bases of an uncertainty space' to identify relevance of other structures like polynomials by connecting these standards to other structures
            - this applies a workflow 'change a base solution' to identify a 'high variation structure set to connect' by identifying different bases as in 'compared inputs to some output' that can be relevant (such as 'high variation interface variables like conceptual solution metrics', and normal data set variables like 'variables that change a type'), which can be similar in structure and other variables
            - relatedly, identifying distant variable connections is similarly useful (such as the 'usefulness/meaning/relevance/independence of volatility') and probably possible most of the time using interface structures or trivial variants of them and which are useful to apply as 'default problem-solving (difference-connecting) structures'
            - identifying various 'graph uncertainty spaces' are useful, like identifying 'probable over-simplifications and over-complexities of a graph like "variable pairs and infinite series" and identifying changes to apply to create other graphs that are likely to be useful given this set of standards representing a common error structure with a known solution such as how 'over-prioritization errors tend to create each other given type/similarity dynamics and the known solution is identifying a balanced point in between extremes, so applying a spectrum between these over-prioritization errors which are applied as "limiting standards" to create a graph space is useful to identify more optimal graphs as a problem-solving workflow' (given that many problems are solvable with a few variables, identifying the graph space where 'starting with graphs of a few variables and applying trivial changes to these graphs' or 'changing most high variation structures into a trivial set of variables like interface structures' will probably trivially create the optimal graphs to solve a problem), which applies an "abstract/general error/solution set" as "limiting standards" and "default structures" to identify an interface query to solve a problem (the query being "identify a balanced point in between various extremes of over-prioritization errors in simplicity/complexity represented as graphs and applied as limiting standards representing a range of solution graphs")
            - as another example, another graph-generating query like "apply a few layers of high variation solution metric graphs with various trivial parameter counts, with lower parameter count graphs as a 'limiting standard of an over-simplification error' forming the 'boundary of the lower range of the minimum parameter count'" is likely to be sufficient to solve most problems with a trivial query of these graphs, which is a higher variation variant of the previous spectrum-based graph
        - relatedly, similar to how its useful to find similarities like 'intersections/bases' in definitions, its similarly useful to find similarities in interfaces like how 'network math and ratio math and sequence math' are useful to connect and identify similarities of to 'identify new variation such as new interfaces' (where 'ratio math' indicates the functions/variables/structures of ratio interactions as an abstract comparison/base info structure, involving identifying for example specific useful ratios like 'extreme differences in a similarity')

    - identify useful structures like 'variables of workflows' (like direction or start/end points or usages) that can be used to fulfill general problem-solving intents like 'index intents/interface queries'
        - for example, identifying useful function types like 'different core function shapes/volatilities' and applying changes to these until there is an obviously fulfilled useful intent by that function type with those changes applied is useful as a reverse-direction function to index intents/interface queries, starting with useful structures like cross-interface structures like 'function types' to filter the solution space to base changes on
        - this is another variant of 'change a base solution' that applies it for a different intent than the defined/standard intent of the workflow, which is to 'identify a more optimal solution' rather than 'connecting useful structures like solutions to intents'
        - this applies a different 'base for change' than a problem-solving intent to the workflow 'change a base solution' which is applied to 'intents' in implementing interface queries in some workflows, where instead the 'solution structures like useful structures' are applied as the new base for change to implement interface queries, useful structures being adjacencies/proxies of intents, similar to how 'requirements' and other bases for workflows/queries can be usefully varied
        - relatedly, given that 'bases for similarization/differentiation in a workflow' are often incomplete, like how requirements, definitions, and optional optimization/solution metrics like cost are often incomplete which is part of the problem (working with incomplete/missing info to identify a specific solution), identify how these incomplete bases can be applied/organized in a workflow to offset these incompleteness is useful to identify, such as a 'ratio of requirements to fulfill suboptimally so that optimization metrics like cost can be optimized for' or 'identifying a point in an area in between optimally implemented requirements and cost structures like minimal costs to filter solutions in', similar to how vacillations between generate/filter and variation/constant and abstraction/specification can be useful when applied in various specific structures
            - relatedly, given that some costs should be ignored sometimes (like how a cost should be ignored if its the only solution that will likely stop climate change or if the cost evaluation function is incorrect), identifying 'areas of optimality in solution metric spaces' is useful as the averages of these densities/areas are probably more robust since the adjacent variants around them are also solutions, assuming adjacent changes are the probable changes, but also 'areas of variance in requirements/definitions/other flexible structures' and how these areas interact, such as how adding variance in requirements can increase optimal solution areas so invalidating requirements is a useful intent, and similarly identify how these structures like 'requirement/similarity/definition/variation/optimality areas and their structures like their overlaps' can be used as limits/bases/filters to make an incomplete structure more useful
        - this applies 'change a base solution' to 'change a base solution' (change the base applied in the 'change a base solution' workflow), which is likely to be possibly reusable across workflows and other useful structures without violating reasons for usefulness or other definitions in some ratio of cases (not every change to the workflow will be useful in all cases, but every change to the workflow that keeps some ratio of similarity will likely be useful in some cases, like how 'reapplying the same solution' in different problems does create some useful info some of the time)
            - relatedly, given the usefulness of recursive workflows, as referenced previously, other workflow interactions like cross-workflow applications are similarly likely to be useful, creating a 'workflow-embedding space' where sequences/sets of abstract workflows can be trivially varied with specifications or other differences to create a set of useful intents as well as creating specific interface structures like 'similarities/overlaps in the maximal differences created by workflows' and the 'highest variation-storing embeddings', applying workflows as interfaces to base changes on, and using them as components of other useful structures like 'maximal differences' and implementations of 'intents' and other pre-computed or adjacent structures of workflows, as 'optimization sequences' which are useful to filter (what metrics are optimized when 'trial and error', 'change a base solution' and 'connect problem/solution' randomly selected in a sequence and applied to which problem sets/contexts), which is useful to identify optimal sequences of to filter interface queries for the next/containing/embedded/other workflow connected to the currently implemented workflow

    - identify useful structures like 'over-reductive/simplified connections' that are 'easily contradicted but which are sufficiently correct/optimal/useful or have a "false similarity to correctness/optimality/usefulness such as simplicity in isolation of other metrics" to be useful to identify contradictions to', which can be applied as a workflow input like a 'base to apply changes to' in a workflow like 'change a base solution'
        - identifying over-reductions/simplifications of a structure is useful as a base to compare and identify the more accurate variant of the structure like 'defining thinking as only iteration' which forms a useful base connection to identify contradictions of (thinking is identifying useful/relevant/optimal variation/connections/requirements/limits/other structures)
            - similarly, the reductive connection 'that is obvious or already identified' is another useful reduction to base changes on (with 'specific measurable connections' implied by this connection, such as that 'iterating through an error type index is useless bc the important/common/probable error types of a network connection or data error are already identified', with a derivable opposition such as that 'the sequence applied by a program has other points of failure than network/data that are useful to identify/derive/test/specify, such as "base/context errors like server errors" or "illogical/rare database implementation variation", where its useful to either "derive the organizing concept connections driving the database implementation" or "check the error type index for identified error types possible with this implementation"'
            - similarly, the reductive connection 'everything is just similarities' (or sequences or combinations) is useful to identify contradictions like 'there is a network of similarities that is more useful to identify than any one similarity and it is important to specify similarities to know which structures are similar, to identify what should/could be similar and to create those optimal similarities', which is useful in that it identifies the position of variation as being 'different from the position of simplicities like similarities', where identifying the position of variation is useful and possible by identifying structures determining its position like inputs/opposites/limits
            - relatedly, identifying 'useful variation in a position/direction/other structure' is a matter of identifying 'connected high variation variables to an intent', which contradicts a definition of thinking as 'iteration', as thinking involves identifying what is likely to be useful and identifying structures in ambiguities and identifying useful intents that are new in some way or havent been completely solved for yet
            - these examples of a 'useful over-reduction to apply changes to fulfill optimization intents like identifying contradictions' are not trivial to derive from an intent like 'find an input solution to apply as a base solution in the change a base solution workflow', which is why its useful to identify and specify as a unique workflow to apply changes to when implementing
        - relatedly, identifying different high variation structure interactions like 'fields of math' as descriptions of 'structures' and 'equivalences' is useful to 'identify other connections to apply changes based on', like how the 'connections of equal structures' can be varied in a useful way to identify 'connections of equal/similar/different/opposite structures/lack of structure/abstract structures', which is possible bc 'connections of equal structures' is a core structure connection, indicating that other core structure connections are similarly useful to vary

    - identify useful structures like 'similarity/adjacency in difference from a similarity' that is determining/causative of a high ratio of variation (like determining how errors change)
        - for example, identifying that 'differences from normal' frequently explain other 'differences from normal' is useful to identify causes of structure connections, like that 'differences from normal' may be more adjacent to other differences from normal than they are to normal, so given this adjacency, it is likelier to cause other adjacent structures than extremely different or extremely normal structures, and similarly, identifying other 'standards where differences applied to those standards explain most variation' is useful in the same way (identifying a similarity of the standard, to identify adjacent and therefore probable structures like sequences based on that similarity)
        - similarly, an error is likelier to create another error of the same type bc of the type symmetry which makes other errors of that type more adjacent (its more trivial to create an over-prioritization error from another over-prioritization structure bc it basically only requires a change in direction, and the rest of the over-prioritization structure can stay the same and still create another error), so identifying these 'error similarities' that are likely to create 'causal sequences of errors' are useful to identify and apply as default sequences in interface queries, and similarly identifying cross-similarity/interface structures in errors where an error adjacently becomes a different type (crossing the type symmetry) is useful to identify

    - identify useful structures like 'variable set sequences' which are useful to apply as 'default interface queries' when they encode 'high variation similarities/differences' that are 'useful/relevant to specify after identifying the base/original set of variables'
        - for example, starting with a graph of high variation variables like a 'complexity/generality graph' as the base/origin graph and applying changes in various directions to identify probable useful differences based on this graph or similar useful graphs is useful as a way to generate interface queries by identifying 'graph paths that are optimal in identifying the right variable sets to describe a problem difference with', which is a specific useful variant of 'change a base solution' (to generate queries like "start by graphing a problem's complexity/generality and apply maximally different specifications such as requirements/limits from there" which is useful to apply since generality contains some info about similarity like an average, and complexity contains some info about differences around or embedded on an average like non-linearity, a similarity/difference structure which is useful to identify a high ratio of variation in a problem to start with, so that useful specifications can be derived as probably useful to apply, like 'complexity types such as volatility')
        - identifying 'useful relevance interactions' is useful as a general problem-solving intent, like how its useful to avoid applying a 'reduce' function to meaning inputs (which reduces meaning) and more useful to apply a 'reduce' function to standards/functions/variable/interface structures to reduce structures that are useful to reduce (identifying connections by reducing steps in the connection, which increases meaning) and thereby avoid reducing meaning
            - similarly, applying standards to meaning is useful to identify the connections of meaning to other structures, and applying concepts to meaning is useful to identify the 'directions where meaning can vary' by connecting meaning to high variation concepts like power/balance/truth (as in 'what is the power of meaning', etc)

    - identify useful structures like 'uncompared/unstandardized structures' that would be useful to standardize/similarize, like interface query metadata like 'usage/implementation/state variable indexes'
        - for example, 'interface structures like "differences in similarities" between interface queries, their usages, usage sequences/directions/states, implementations, implementation sequences/directions/states, etc' are useful to 'identify meta variables of interface queries', like how far away useful differences are likely to be and identify probable positions of useful differences (once these similarities are computed, it will be more trivial to identify when an interface query can be completed more trivially, as in its remaining implementation can be skipped since the differences remaining to resolve are identified, as being completable/connectible with an iteration or an alternative like a interface change or cross-interface structure or by determining the value of some solution metric compared to a standard value, or when the query should be changed/optimized during description/filtering/implementation/application time, bc the 'state of an interface query used for this intent and implemented in this way' would already be computed to have some similarity through a common standard to a query that involves fewer steps to complete without invalidating the similarity on other variables like intent, and therefore query-switching/changing can be done with these 'usage/query/implementation variable similarities' like 'remaining variation/complexity/specificity similarities, at this state of these interface queries for these intents', given the useful change added by query-switching like invalidating the original query or applying a different perspective that can reach info that would have required iterations in the original query), similar to how pre-computing other interface structures like relevance structures of these 'usage/query/implementation indexes' would be useful for filtering/changing interface queries
        - relatedly, 'identifying when interface structures create errors in common/useful cases related to relevance structures like standards' is useful, like where its useful to identify that an 'approximation can invalidate the differentiation value of a standard'
        - relatedly, an unsolved problem is 'identifying the specificity/variation of interface queries required to describe all useful structures' (whether a set of structures that encode similarities like synchronizations/requirements is enough or whether interface queries are more often required or whether specifications like a 'specific system interaction network' are required to solve a problem in every possible system)
            - relatedly, a useful intent is identifying new system variables to generate new system interaction networks to identify where trivial combinations of identified structures arent sufficient to describe an interaction (applying trivial combinations of abstract structures like synchronizations/requirements but applying it in a set of quantified system interaction networks like a set of vectors indicating that specific system's interactions on its specific abstract similarity indexes, which might identify new set of structures required to solve all problems in a quantifiable trivial way)
        - relatedly, 'identifying structures to invalidate an interface like intent' is a useful problem-solving intent where a problem is caused by a variable on the interface to be invalidated, such as a network that makes all intents trivial by making all nodes adjacently traversible or a network that makes all changes reversible, invalidating cause
        - identifying the network of interface structure definition connections like 'similarity/requirement connections' is useful as default interface queries or query components to solve problems using 'defined interface interaction functions which are highly variable and likely to be useful in connecting problem differences' so for example 'applying similarity/requirement connections by default to connect problems/solutions'
        - identifying the connections on an interface like the similarity/difference interface that connect 'volatility/generality/complexity/other interface variables on that interface like volatility-generality connections on the similarity/difference interface' so there is a default set of interface queries connecting solution metrics on each interface is useful to apply as a 'maximally different difference-connecting set of connections'
        - identifying that a workflow is a 'difference in an abstract interface similarity' like a 'function connecting function types' is useful to identify/filter interface queries
        - identifying the relevance of an interface such as the meaning through all possible or the net interactions of an interface like similarity (meanings such as 'connecting differences' or 'differentiating ambiguities') is useful to identify when to apply an interface, through when one of those interactions is useful (useful as in 'connective of relevant differences')

    - identify useful structures like 'maximal differences between useful variants like the simplest function of a data set and the errors that could be relevant given some interface structure applied in a structure like a point/sequence/combination/intersection'
        - for example, identifying the position of an intersection is useful to identify 'probable function changes (and probable functions) around that point', like how a position at an intersection with additional variables (like an intersection at the 'size where momentum would start to be relevant') is useful to identify as a point where variation should be applied (as opposed to one constant value) bc 'more different functions' are possible at that point than at other points (which means depending on other variables like 'surface texture, angle of surface, and the ratios necessary to make these variables relevant', 'more different functions' are possible at the 'momentum threshold intersection position' than at other positions, and this intersection determines/changes other variables like speed/slope to connect to other points, making it a relevant variable to identify as a 'possible embedded and determining variable in a data set'), which is useful to apply as a 'solution function filter' (as in 'check if there is a useful interface structure like a "relevant intersection" at every differentiable position, which would make these functions probable around that point')
            - there are likely simpler/useful connections between points in cases where these interface structures are possibilities/probabilities and would indicate a more complex function or set of functions, which is why its useful to identify the 'positions where these interface structures (if relevant) would create the biggest errors compared to these simpler/otherwise useful connections'
            - these high variation points are useful to identify with the constant points that connect/limit them to additively filter the solution set by identifying these constant points
            - similarly, applying interface dynamics like 'identify the most stable base/connection and apply changes to it to identify dynamics enabled by the base/connection' is useful to identify variable interactions as well as connecting workflows to realistic system interactions (in reality, changes are applied to base structures until a limit is reached or the base is invalid, so 'change a base solution until an optimization or error is reached' follows from that system interaction)
            - also connecting workflows to errors they account for is useful, like how 'derive (as in identify adjacencies/connections like extensions/extrapolations/implications/requirements/probabilities until some question has one answer or few similar or few easily differentiated/tested answers left or until a limit on derivation is identified or until a question that needs to be answered before this question is identified as in "derive what needs to be derived")' is useful with 'missing info' bc it can account for and correct that error structure, and how 'change a base solution' is useful mostly only with highly optimal info conditions
        - given that there is always a way to connect some variable x to some variable y in some polynomial if some condition is allowed like 'any number of repetitions/multiplications is allowed', identify the limits on these connections is useful to identify where independent variables cant be connected in some condition like uniqueness or continuity, to identify variables that are more directly un/connectible, identify positions in the variable interaction space that arent traversed or arent often traversed, etc (as in 'these variables can be connected in this function, but that would never occur in reality, bc of this interface structure like a limit on stability')
        - relatedly, given the alternate bases formed by alternate connections, 'time interface/base switching' is a dynamic to be aware of in quantum entanglement experiments that create a lot of alternate connections that form/allow/incentivize alternate bases/interfaces
        - relatedly, identifying sources of 'structures that are usually errors' like 'sources of real/valid high volatility' is useful as a set of differences to apply when the more probable/common alternative isnt a solution
        - relatedly, identifying 'related errors in other structures like solution-finding methods that interact with error structures like high volatility' such as how 'easily tricked algorithms that change their outputs based on incorrect patterns/similarities like patterns of recent examples' is related to 'volatility' in that it could create volatility, similar to how an identity function with volatile inputs could create volatility and randomness can also create volatility

    - identify useful structures like 'inputs of different truth networks' like 'identifying the generality of a truth ratio' and the 'usefulness of specifying a general useful structure', these networks being useful to identify as different graphs that can be applied as 'query bases or query components or query defaults'
        - for example, insights like 'truth count compared to falsehood count, above a specific value, is more useful than an equal ratio of true/false which is more of a question/ambiguity than an answer/ambiguity-resolving ratio' can be applied with other insights like 'connections are often more correct in a network/field/spectrum format than a simple linear format, because info rarely stabilizes into a single simple connection', so that the structure of a 'network of truth structures, related to usefulness' is derived, and this network can be specified with structures like 'truth ratio variants like "probably true truth ratios"', 'truth types like reliability, accuracy, replicability, reusability', 'connections between truth/usefulness structures like accuracy/reusability, which indicate connections determined by concepts like generality'
        - this is similar to applying related insights like 'there are often multiple variants of a truth statement' bc its 'rare to identify a case where a true structure is surrounded adjacently in every similarity index by false structures'
        - this is derivable bc the 'structure of a truth ratio is general enough to be a useful solution structure applied across problems', but its possible to 'identify other truth ratios that are useful' like 'specific probable truth ratio ranges' or 'ratios between accuracy/volatility/generality/simplicity that are associated with other useful structures like stability/efficiency which make them likelier to represent truth structures'

    - identify useful structures like different organizations of interface structures (like 'alternating requirements/changes' or 'similarity indexes to make differences/connections countable/otherwise structural') that make connections between them likely to be highly structural (countable, definable, similarizable, etc) when applied to fulfill intents related to specific interface structures (applied to 'connect sets of different functions' or to 'connect core structures to relevance structures')
        - for example, a 'graph of different counts of interface structures' is not likely to create other useful interface structures like useful variants/connections between interface structures (except in rare cases that are infrequently applicable like 'a higher ratio of number of reasons it could be true vs. number of reasons it could be false is likelier to indicate a truth than a falsehood'), which applies a workflow of 'identify obvious errors to apply changes to in order to create more optimal structures'
            - however, if a 'similarity index' is applied correctly, it could reduce the problem of 'deriving new connections between interface structures and other new useful structures' to a highly meaningful/relevant and highly structured graph like a partially count-based graph like where 'number of nodes away on some similarity index branch' or 'number of angle changes in a sequence/set of similarity index branch changes' or 'number of overlaps traversed in a similarity index network' or 'number of comparatively high distances in steps away from a core similarity index' has a high ratio of info/variation/meaning in the graph
        - relatedly to identifying useful graphs to base interface queries on, a set of 'combinations of interface structures to create input cases' is useful as a limiting force on the changes/connections/applications of a interface structure network (the network having 'definition or defining example' connections between interface structures, and the next layer having different connection types like 'emergent definition functionality', such as with an 'application/usage network' and an 'outer limiting network of probable/simple/core/unit cases' which creates 'specific variants of definition interactions' and the next 'outer layer of extreme/unique cases creating extreme variants of definition interactions', and adding embedded layers to this graph like 'probable connections' or 'probable error connections' is useful to identify patterns in these interactions that create relevance structures like 'solutions/errors'
        - relatedly, 'regular intervals of new requirements' is another way to organize a useful graph to base queries on, but there are unlikely to be more relevant requirements to apply than 'connecting different function sets' using different interface structures like 'similarities/graphs/definitions' to 'connect all interface structures and all useful applications of interface structures' to 'solve all problems', so this is a good requirement set to base changes on

    - identify useful structures like 'variable requirements of base/input variables of low-dimensional solution structures like polynomials' (like 'overlapping ranges', 'different value levels that can change the output variable') that can 'filter possible low-dimensional interface structure connections' using adjacent structures to those solution structures like 'low-dimensional solution metrics like volatility'
        - for example, 'perspective generality/volatility' is likely to be formattable as a polynomial by applying some variable value to a variable of 'filters' which is a component of perspectives whose variation can explain perspective variation, and similarly a concept explaining variation in priorities can likely be applied as a standard of various perspective definitions to indicate how different ranges of the concept variables can explain variation in perspectives, to identify 'filter specificity or priority complexity' for example as a 'volatile variable that can explain most perspective volatility'
        - identifying a variable that can be used to explain another interface variable is a matter of 'identifying a set of definitions of the explained variable that have different value levels/ranges or which overlap in range but are additive in that they are likely to co-occur, or ranges that are likely to be connectible such as by overlapping so that they can be summarized with a polynomial'
        - identifying structures that cant be polynomialized based on another interface variable is a way to identify new variation sources, since these higher-complexity structures are likelier to have new variables
        - applying these solution metric variables (like 'high variation metrics of 2-d functions') to interface structures (structure interface metrics like 'spectrum volatility' and meaning interface metrics like 'relevance volatility' under some set of conditions) can be useful to identify adjacent connections between interface structures which would otherwise require networks or other multi-dimensional or differently defined structures
        - more often, these will need to be filtered to refer to a subset of the definition, where multiple polynomials with the same base variable or with different base variables will need to be identified, like how 'spectrum variation volatility' is likelier to be adjacently polynomialized using other interface structures, but 2-d connections are useful to identify and are useful to identify even when they function as good approximations, to identify relevance of variables if not a 1-to-1 equivalence or mapping
        - relatedly, its possible to 'identify these metrics in definition networks of a structure' such as how a 'volatile connection in a definition network' would be 'between a range formed by independent connections and adjacent/linear connections', so the base/input variable of the polynomial describing 'volatility of the structure' would be in that interim set, by applying the 'definition of volatility' to filter the 'definition network of the structure', given that these metrics are likely to be describable with a definition network of a sufficiently high variation/general structure, even if a metric like volatility doesnt directly cover the whole definition network, and identifying definition network-generating functions that have structures like 'counts/degrees' that map to these metrics is similarly useful (like 'random' structures being adjacent/similar to 'volatile' structures in the network)
        - once identified, these adjacent connections between interface structures are useful as default interface queries
        - relatedly, identifying relevance-structure interactions is useful, such as how a 'variable might be so relevant, it becomes/is required', to identify how these structures connect so 'queries to generate relevance from requirements or vice versa' can be identified using these connections

    - identify useful structures like 'reference points applied as standards' (such as truth networks, similarity indexes, solution metrics, problem definitions) which are useful across workflows/functions like 'change/compare' since 'applying changes to solutions' is useful but its more useful when another 'reference point' is added to be another 'standard to compare to/base changes on' like 'change a solution, in a direction away from identified problems' which adds a useful 'default limit on the change being applied' (applying multiple standards is better than just one, even if the one standard is useful through being abstract like a 'set of solution metrics'), so that useful 'standards sets for intents like change or compare' can be identified as default 'routes in a network of standards' or 'interface queries', so applying additional standards to workflows is a useful way to specify them
        - for example, identifying 'useful specific base networks' as 'base solutions' is useful to identify as a useful specified input to a workflow like 'change a base solution', since identifying all the interface structures (like requirements/intents/variants/inputs) of a workflow is useful to identify its other structures like its relevance structures like its 'limit on usefulness'
        - this optimization of 'adding another standard' is useful in the case where a 'solution range' or 'change range' is useful to identify, which means that similarly, where other change structures are useful, other standards structures will be useful
        - relatedly, 'absolute/general meaning' has associated structures like a 'new similarity index' which is generally useful across problems, so identifying generally meaningful/relevant/useful structures can be implemented by identifying variables of these structures from an example (given that some structures are only determinable as correct with an example and a point opposing a counterpoint of the example)
        - relatedly, identifying how solution metrics are similar/different/connected to other structures is useful, like how 'volatility' can be described as 'similarity to randomness without equivalence' and 'output difference, based on previous/next adjacent inputs' and 'accuracy/validity' is 'similarity to a truth network', to determine all the structures which are useful to 'base changes on or compare to', to identify variables of these and identify other structures that are useful to 'base changes on or compare to', these being similar functions which can connect 'change/compare' workflows
            - relatedly, as mentioned elsewhere, 'basing changes on solutions' is a way to reverse engineer problems, so identifying 'direction of progress' and 'solution structures like solution areas/patterns/networks' are useful to apply as a opposing/limiting structure for these 'changes in a direction'
        - 'compare' is useful as a workflow/core interaction function ('compare a structure across structures until relevant similarities/differences are identified, and apply other workflow functions like change/connect to those similarities/differences to solve the problem') but lacks specificity in that there is always some metric fulfilled by a structure that can be applied as a solution metric without being generally useful, so comparing solution metrics to a network of solution metrics becomes useful to correct this and associated possible errors
            - 'change a base solution' is implemented by identifying 'networks of structures like variables/solutions fulfilling a solution metric like a validity/generality network of valid/general solutions or solution variables' which is useful to 'compare new solutions with' and 'base changes on to identify new solutions or solution variables'

    - identify useful structures like the 'useful differences to vary' such as 'change ratio' based on the 'identified errors of a workflow' like requiring 'many iterations, with low increment distance' in 'many randomly selected cases'
        - for example, 'maximally different changes' as opposed to 'incremental changes' are likelier to make 'trial and error' more optimal bc of the 'highly reductive change' added by maximal differences to the high variation solution set applied by 'trial and error'
        - relatedly, workflows like 'trial and error' and 'change a base solution' have 'overlapping solutions' as well as 'areas without overlaps', where one workflow cant generate the solution identified by another workflow, indicating that there is likely variation in workflows possible in identifying additional workflows to identify that solution, since there are always multiple ways to identify a solution, so these 'areas of gaps in solution overlaps' are possible 'variation sources'
            - relatedly, workflows have 'requirement/intent/structure overlaps' like 'similar requirements' such as 'identify possible solutions' which are useful in identifying 'oppositions to requirements' (as alternate solutions to the problem of requirements) and identifying non-required intents as possible 'variation sources'
        - relatedly, other workflows/intents can be identified by applying other interactions/structures like how 'apply a solution to a solution' sounds useless but would be useful for 'identifying how optimized structures can create errors when applied to each other', which would be trivial/useful to identify using that structure, to identify optimizations of how to 'store/manage/organize interactions of solutions'
        - relatedly, informing neural network neurons with "solution/similarity/variable indexes or base networks like 'validity networks' or workflows" to apply as neuron variables to increase the 'variation describing potential of the network' is useful to identify subtler changes as well as new interaction functions emerging from these higher variation neurons
            - relatedly, identifying ways to increase the info access of neurons (to the info of what other neurons are computing) is useful to create direct routes between neurons that can be used as directly computible connections (a neuron that can 'see' all other neurons' computations at once bc the computations have easily verified signals and the neurons all have 'direct routes to each other that dont overlap so each neuron can be differentiated from the others from any position' will be able to determine probable outcomes and ways to correct incorrect outcomes)
        - relatedly, identifying 'abstract graphs/networks/indexes/maps' is useful to determine the 'emergent meaning of an interface query', similar to how applying specific graphs/networks/indexes/maps is already identified as useful like 'validity networks', where abstraction adds a higher computational advantage in determining 'net impact or emergent meaning of a structure like an interface query' for its ability to contain higher variation despite not increasing in size (not zooming out to see the 'bigger picture' but still seeing 'more patterns in variation' despite the constant size), so 'identify a new abstraction of a useful structure like a graph that has a useful similarity/difference for some unoptimized intent' is a general problem-solving intent
            - this means there are 'equivalent meaning structures like meaning-identification functions (like compute more interactions, apply more specific base networks, apply more useful structures, apply abstractions to determine meaning)' that are useful to identify as 'alternate meaning routes' as 'alternate interface queries'
        - relatedly, identifying 'cost minimization' as being 'valid from a subset of perspectives rather than all perspectives in most cases' is useful, since from another perspective, 're-distributed costs from a cost minimizing algorithm' are 'cost maximization for another agent', so identifying 'perspectives that minimize costs in general (making all nodes adjacent or direct)', 'algorithms that minimize costs and the resulting costs of minimized costs and cost minimizations' and other structures that have a solution for this case of 'cost minimization being cost maximization when resulting costs are unhandled or when agent benefits oppose each other' are useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying 'abstraction' and other 'similarities with trivial differences' as an implementation of 'change a base solution' bc of 'trivial changes applied' is useful to 'identify other structures with similarities to workflows' like 'change perspective of the problem/solution' being similar to 'change combinations of abstract priorities (which create perspectives)', and similarly converting other workflows into interface structures is useful to identify other workflows
        - relatedly, identifying other useful solution metrics (like 'generally correct', 'abstractly correct (correct in some type/concept/similarity)', 'relevantly correct (as in fulfills many important variables)', 'correct in many cases', etc) are useful to identify as 'interface structures of solution metrics (like types of correctness), optionally also connecting them with relevance structures (the interactions as in the meaning of those correctness types)', as similarities are the basis of these and new solution metrics such as 'cross-interface correctness' indicating a 'similarity to a cross-interface structure like a cross-interface definition so that it fulfills definitions on multiple interfaces' or like how validity/accuracy is a 'similarity to a truth network', which is useful to identify other solution metrics
            - similarly, its useful to identify these connections so that 'general correctness' can be mapped to other specific metrics like 'general/specific volatility' and 'general/specific relevance' as 'default connections that can be used as interface queries' in cases like where a "workflow can be replaced with 'abstraction'"
        - relatedly, identifying useful vacillations between interfaces like a 'structure/meaning vacillation' is useful to identify patterns/functions to filter interface queries

    - identify useful error structures like 'errors in assumed/default/identified optimal/solution structures like workflows/filters' like 'areas where definitions require errors in some cases like how "changes to a solution" are definitively capable of including errors'
        - for example, 'change a base solution' has an error resulting from its definitions that changing an optimal structure can make it less optimal, given that differences from solutions can be errors, so theres an area of overlap between 'changes to solutions' and 'errors', however its not a 1-to-1 mapping (a definitive equivalence) so its still useful to identify what changes to a solution could be applied that wouldnt create errors
        - relatedly, interactions like 'overlaps between errors' like 'filter errors' and 'missing filters', where 'changes to a filter' basically equate to 'another error which is a functionally missing filter', since the filter may as well not exist at all once changed enough, are useful to identify between interface structure

    - identify useful structures like 'variants/interactions/iterations' of useful structures like 'relevance structures' like 'relevance spectrums' that can filter a set like 'specific sets of generally useful relevance structures'
        - identifying 'specific relevance structures' that are generally useful like sets of relevance components that a 'solution automation workflow' fulfills like a 'generally useful structure and a new definition/component/requirement/structure of relevance and an increase in relevance probability of another less optimal structure' which make the workflow applicable to solving most problems
        - as mentioned elsewhere, 'relevance structures' are useful abstractions to start building interface queries around/on/from (as opposed to building based on a specific solution metric like 'validity/possibility/requirements' like 'valid sequences of interface structures' or building based on other workflows like 'variations of "change a base solution"' or building based on 'problem/solution difference resolution'), so approaching interface query design by first identifying 'useful relevance structures and then changing them (such as by specifying them) until they connect to general/specific solution requirements' is a new type of solution automation workflow
        - this means that rather than 'interface queries implementing a workflow', specific problem-solving intents like 'find useful iterations/variants/interactions/structures of relevance' can be applied and solved for, to enable other intents like 'find every connection between different positions on a relevance spectrum', since most problems will be formattable as an 'incorrect position on a relevance spectrum' so the problem-solving intents become 'identifying current/error position on the relevance spectrum' and 'identifying optimal position on the relevance spectrum' and 'identifying connection functions for every set of differences in position on the relevance spectrum'
        - relatedly, solving a specific problem is often a matter of 'connecting a pair of abstract structures' (problem/solution, lack of filters/filters, solution set/specific solution, solution set/solution metrics, problem definition/solution metrics) but 'identifying graphs that connect bigger sets of abstract structures' is a useful problem-solving intent bc once its identified, queries can be run on it to connect pairs (solve problems) trivially, which applies the workflow of 'solve the more complex variant of a problem so its subsets will likely contain or overlap with solutions to simpler variants'
        - relatedly, connecting structural variants of high variation concepts like 'embedded independence' as a 'set of components adjacent to relevance' is useful to connect to relevance structures like 'relevance spectrums' as a useful structure set to connect through the high variation mappings possible there which are likely to be useful in filtering interface queries (once a relevance structure is determined to be useful for an interface query, its useful to already have this index of 'relevance structures and cross-interface structures that connect adjacently to relevance through crossing the uncertainty space' computed to determine the interface query to implement/use that structure, such as connecting 'embedding independence/variation' as a useful 'specification' of 'embedded relevance' to filter the query implementing 'embedded relevance')

    - identify useful structures like the 'network of useful changes to apply to a standard' to identify 'default interface queries'
        - identifying 'reasons for standards changes' are useful, such as 'changing between equally meaningful but differently usable/measurable standards' (like instead of using a measuring cup, using ratio based on fill of original storage container), where 'standards' can be 'applied at relevant times (at usage time like when energy is needed, before irreversible change time like heating time, before investing in one solution like one ratio of ingredients that could be extremely incorrect), in relevant structures (based on size of original storage container, based on size of new processing container, based on size of useful requirements for storage lifetime, based on a useful testable unit size for enough variety to identify good solutions from the tested units), and changed in relevant ways to better optimize some metric/intent (invalidate/remove/reduce the meaning of a standard by making sure most/all inputs fulfill it)' like (make sure regardless of amount or ratio that some other ingredient which optimizes the relevant metric is applied, like an ingredient that makes most ratios of other ingredients successful), which involves:
            - 'delaying the standard (moving it to another time standard)' (apply the standard at usage time where its most relevant, or during unit tests of different combinations which is similarly relevant, or during processing/mixing time)
            - 'moving the position of the application of a standard to another standard' (measure based on the standard of the fixing ingredient, rather than measuring the original ingredient, if the fixing ingredient is more important or useful to measure, or measure after mixing, if another ingredient has a required dependency for its amount on the other amount, where mixing is useful for being easily corrected when incorrect)
            - 'solving/invalidating a standard, by making any input successful in other ways' (determining the ingredient that can fix most combinations of other ingredients)
            - 'solving/invalidating a standard, by applying its variables to avoid applying the standard as a filter of solutions, by pre-filtering or integration with generative functions' ('pre-mix ingredients', or 'change ingredients until they coordinate in more ratios/ranges')
            - from this example, it can be derived that there is usually a 'set of similar/equivalent standards in a problem space (ratio of measuring cup or ratio of original container), where only one should be selected and applied' and there are often a 'set of standards which reflect different info in a problem space', where most of these different standards should be connected in a solution (applying tests/measurements/filters at different times and in different positions rather than applying only one, to determine more variables of the problem space, in subsets/combinations that will quickly reveal the structures like limits/variables of these standards)
            - it also indicates the 'intent of a standard' (in its most useful state) is to 'invalidate the standard' by 'determining its useful differences/similarities, selecting the optimal subsets, and applying these optimal subsets to reduce/apply the meaning of the standard as a constant or remove its application completely, once its identified (like by integrating the optimal structures for a given standard with the generative inputs or making functions that create bigger ranges of optimality so that these standards are less useful as filters or finding a way to make the less optimal ranges useful in general or for other specific intents)'
            - relatedly, some of these measuring standards are useful bc the 'values of the standard that are likely to be used' (a few units of a measuring cup, a half/fourth) are trivial to measure
        - identify useful variants of workflows like 'change a base solution until a new base solution seems more relevant' or 'change a base solution until its standards are irrelevant such as where a new base solution optimizes more metrics' or 'change standards used to implement existing solutions'
        - identify useful optimizations like 'route inputs that often/always create errors to functions with more multi-functionality' and their errors like how 'multi-functional functions are likely to be able to prevent this if its too high a ratio of their resources and are also likely to be handling re-routed errors from other functions' and identify related useful structures like 'optimizations of optimizations to handle these errors' like how its better to 'create multi-functionality by identifying the changes that are sufficiently different enough to be useful for creating multi-functionality but also are likely to be possible to handle, so that multi-functionality can be more distributed' or to 'batch/queue/distribute re-routed inputs to avoid creating mismatches in requests/resources for multi-functional functions' or to "only route inputs to multi-functional functions to fulfill intents like improving both functions' multi-functionality"
        - the problem solved by a workflow is 'reduce/connect/filter according to some standard like a solution metric' such as 'identify a solution function, to fulfill a structural intent with that function like "to connect inputs/outputs", to fulfill the solution metric of "outputs of new inputs are trivial to compute/connect"' which has alternatives like 'change new inputs into already computed inputs, once "representative inputs" are all identified'
            - 'identifying representative inputs' is a non-trivial problem that is made more trivial by identifying relevant variables like 'lower/upper limits on variation of a variable set', so that when representative inputs 'represent enough variation above a ratio', they can be 'applied as representative inputs' and the search for representative inputs can be halted, similarly identifying 'networks of inputs' is useful to 'identify representative inputs'
        - relatedly, identifying 'cross-interface meanings' of structures like 'base networks that are useful to compare other structures to', like 'how a specific similarity/difference function like a specific symmetric polynomial has meaning when it represents variables in a requirement network', so that 'identifying a useful function/structure for an intent' is more trivial by these pre-computed meanings of cross-interface structures
        - relatedly, identifying 'overlaps in relevance for intents' is useful (like a structure that is 'useful for define' is likely also 'useful for describe' bc of the overlap in those functions since theyre not independent functions), just like identifying 'mixes of relevance types' is useful as a set of abstract relevance structures to identify and to base interface queries on by connecting these relevance structures to solution metrics for specific problems/workflows
        - relatedly, identifying whether an algorithm was 'successful or whether it was coincidence/luck' is useful to identify by whether there were 'pre-filters applied to the problem space outside of the algorithm' and whether there is 'variance in other input sets' and whether the 'algorithm can create errors'

    - identify useful structures like 'reality-covering sets' as useful for creating 'partitions as filters/subsets of reality' which 'some subset of useful structures' must be similarizable/useful for, to reduce the problem to 'sorting/organizing the set once its identified/filtered'
        - identifying 'required limited sets' (like core interaction functions, core concepts, etc) that are required in that they are 'reality-covering variables/sets' so 'every structure must be similar/useful for an item in that set', which is useful to identify that a 'subset of generated structures of interface structures' is useful in defining/describing/representing/determining/generating/filtering these interface structures, which means there is a subset of iterated interface structures that defines filter/build/apply as well as power/balance/truth, and therefore once these similar iterated structures are identified as similar/useful for fulfilling functions like define for these interface structures, these defined interface structures can be varied in a useful way ('defined in a simple way', 'defined in a maximally different way', 'defined in an abstract way') which is useful to identify interactions between these 'iterated structures associated with a structures', which is a non-trivial task that is now trivial (identify the 'simple definition of a structure set, out of this set of definitions grouped as similar after generating these iterated interface structures', and 'identify the interactions of those simple definitions' to implement abstract intents that can use simple structures like 'identify trivial routes between structures in the set')
        - 'unpredictable iteration results' are useful to identify and predict the position/variables/structures of, like where an iteration could or will definitely intersect with other structures likely to 'interfere, oppose, or otherwise interact with iterations', since some iteration results like limits/convergences are identifiable/predictable and some are not, and where theyre not, those are useful to identify and identify structures of them
        - identifying 'iterated interface structures' with 'cross-scale similarities' is useful to filter out structures that cant 'create enough differences to solve a problem' so theyre not useful interface queries and similarly, identifying 'cross-functional similarities in iterated interface structures' is useful as a 'default set of connections' to apply in interface queries
        - similarly, specific abstract concepts and other interface structures can be used to identify the 'power-based variant of a function implementation' and other variants (a filter implementation that prioritizes isolating powerful variables first, for example)

    - identifying errors like 'incompleteness/inaccuracy' in a useful structure like a 'network of determining variables' which are useful to identify 'optimization opportunities' with 'identifiable optimizations' ('determining variables' have enough structure to be identifiable and for their optimizations and interaction optimizations to be identifiable')
        - for example, identifying an 'interaction network of determining variables' is useful to identify their structures like 'switching/coordination interaction functions, their variants and variables, their equivalents/opposites, and the systems that support the most determining variables' (which can be determined by the most variables that are the most powerful as in 'creating extreme changes from trivial inputs', supporting the most variation)
        - determining variables can take many forms like 'whichever agent arrives at a position first with more resources than a threshold value' or a 'function that, when applied in a specific pattern/position, determines what other functions can be used' a 'repeatable unit that, when iterated, determines the rest of the system' or a 'variable that, when present, overrides all other variable sets' or a 'variable that simplifies a structure enough to be the only relevant variable to identify so its used in all future calculations' or a 'limiting variable that determines when other variables stop/end' or a 'variable that changes all other variables' (which are specific cases that can vary, as theyre 'incomplete specifications of determining variables', since a 'variable that changes all other variables' might not be a determining variable in a case like 'if there are other more determining variables')
            - identifying the 'complete specifications of determining variables and their interactions' is useful bc 'variables of determining variable interactions' are more determining than any subset of the 'network of determining variables'
            - identifying the structures like 'potential variation' that make these determining variables possible/valid/used/relevant is similarly useful to identify
            - relatedly, specific determining variable interactions like 'determining variable sets that "can" all cause or be caused, or all in fact "definitely" cause and are caused (both directions co-occur)' leading to structures like 'spins/symmetries/cycles' and 'vertex ambiguities (like where direction of cause is indeterminable, such as where a variable creates enough variation to reverse control of or invalidate the original causal variable, such as "recursions that dont get activated at all, therefore being determined by inputs/usages, or are inaccurately activated infinitely and meaninglessly, being determined by this possible error type, or recursions with halts, or recursions that change the function/data being recursed or system requiring the recursion")' are useful as 'other probable types of time' as in 'probable connections/co-occurring sets', 'possible alternates', 'reversibilities', 'different sequences that all occur or are all valid/useful in the same set/network' where this 'lack of filtering' through 'allowing multiple directions of cause' is a different type of time than the time structure of filtering/changes that involve 'selecting a subset of sustainable changes to apply', where other variants include 'applying all possible changes'
        - relatedly, there are only so many interface structures like 'sub-problems described by interface structure combinations' that are necessary to describe a sufficiently specific implementation of high-level functions like 'describe/determine/differentiate/organize/standardize', so generating these and filtering them by grouping them into this relatively trivial set is useful/trivial
            - relatedly, identifying 'grouping' (by identifying similar structures on some variable set) as an alternative to 'filtering' (by identifying structures matching the specific filter variable set) is useful to identify 'alternate variable sets to compare data points (or variants of data points) to'
        - relatedly, identifying 'approximations of functionality like intelligence' is useful to identify, such as rather than having 'intelligence functions', having 'probably useful inputs/outputs, with an iterable connection function, or a variable that can be varied to create other input/output sets', which are useful to identify as a general problem-solving intent

    - identify useful structures like 'questions that identify new variables' to identify new problem/solution structures like 'new workflows'
        - for example, workflows are based on various connections between problem/solution structures, like increasing/generative connections, decreasing/filtering connections, horizontal connections across problems, base solutions or solution concepts/patterns/types, or other variables
        - answering the question of 'identifying what other structures connect structures' identifies 'reality-covering variables' (like abstraction, similarity, power, balance, etc) as an 'alternative connection type', by applying the 'extreme' difference to the variable of 'scale' of the structure 'connection size' to an 'infinite value', at which point it becomes trivial to identify 'reality-covering variables' as useful to describe that infinite connection and subsets of it
        - these other variables can be described by reality-covering variables, so identifying 'ways that a reality-covering variable can change' is likely to be useful as a default connection set to apply as possible solutions (the interface query that solves a problem will likely occur in a subset of a reality-covering variable change sequence/network)
        - the problem then becomes 'identify at what point in the sequence/network should an interface query be started in order to solve a particular problem', since every problem is likely to be solved with a subset of these reality-covering variable changes/connections, which is a problem of 'matching the problem to a node on the sequence/network, and matching the solution metrics to a probably useful ending point, or just applying the various change sequences to the problem from that starting point'
        - similarly, as opposed to identifying 'general reality-covering variables' as connection structures, identifying 'systems/graphs/contexts where a problem is connectible to a solution' is an alternate connection structure set (since the system determines the connections possible in the system with some specificity)
        - similarly, identifying 'specific defined-relevant solution metrics such as function/function comparison variables' like 'volatility/specificity' as likely to be relevant in 'determining connections/similarities in a solution set' is useful to identify 'other default variables/connections to apply changes to' in a workflow like 'change a base solution' (default variables/connections like 'functions fulfilling combinations of solution metrics'), which has a useful variant like 'change relevant variables of base solutions like combinations of variables that describe maximal differences across functions' or 'change identified base errors to generate more relevant errors'
            - similarly, identifying 'complementary/coordinating sets' or other structures which solve for default non-connecting intents like 'complete/reduce/filter' are also useful as 'default connection structures' since they connect different structures than actual connections, where those different structures are likely to be relevant through the 'generality of the core functions fulfilled' and the 'connectivity of formats', similar to how 'connecting independent structures' is useful as a 'default connection/solution set'
            - similarly, identifying 'defined/default relevance structures having structures like "combinations" of "similarity in meaning/usefulness/relevance" such as being "all of defined/valid/non-random/non-linear/required/possible/similar/interactive"' is useful to 'identify new possible connections/solutions', where 'identifying new connections/variables' often involves rules like 'if a structure is useful in one format, it could show up as useful in another format if not prevented by definitions' so identifying 'formats that are relevant by definition potential' and 'identified useful structures that are not prevented by definitions in a format' (such as whether a 'frequency' or 'transform' or 'sequence' has a 'definition in some format', so that identifying the 'fibonacci variant of a structure' for example becomes a useful specific intent to filter interface queries when a relevant structure like a 'adjacent input growth sequence' has a 'defined relevance structure' like 'definition/similarity/interactivity' in a format), and similarly identifying "non-adjacent indirect structures as especially 'useful to connect'" is useful to apply as 'default possible connections to implement in a format' to identify new connections
            - relatedly, identifying the structures that 'trivially/otherwise usefully cross the "uncertainty space between spectrums (like linearity/randomness)"' are useful as 'default connections/sequences'
            - relatedly, identifying structures in the uncertainty space like 'ambiguities between functions with extreme differences that fulfill the same function metric combinations' as useful to 'connect and apply these connections as a default set of problem-solving intents or default connections'
        - similarly, identifying 'missing/new connections in a solution set' is useful to identify 'interface variables that havent been applied yet' as default variables to apply changes to in fulfillment of a workflow like 'change a base solution'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'specificity required' to 'contain enough variation, without filtering out useful trivial connections' is useful to identify 'specific structures that can implement the required specificity' like 'iterated' as in 'specific/filtered' interface structures like 'format connectivity' and 'function generality' or 'system interactivity' as specific enough to be useful to connect to 'connection types (like specific sets/sequences like "complementary sets")' or 'default relevance structures' or 'general problem-solving intents' (where 'function generality' might be specific enough to make 'connecting it to other similarly specific or even cross-specificity structures' a relatively trivial task, without removing too many other function types, and where this connection intent relates to other problems through its generality/validity/other relevance structures), where 'specificity' applied to the 'position of the problem/solution definition' is especially useful in that position, where 'connecting specific structures like "indirect semi-independent structures" that allow reality-covering variables and function variables and other variable sets to be relevant and therefore relevant in differentiating solutions' is a useful general problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying the 'optimal set of usages of the abstract/interface network' is unsolved and useful to identify as a 'useful structure to apply with the network'
        - relatedly, identifying 'simple relevance structures' like 'definition changes/connections/variants' is useful and identifying other relevance structures that fulfill multiple solution metrics like 'adjacent/new/high variation' is also useful like connections/changes/variants of solution metric sets like 'reality-covering variables and function/interface variables and comparison variables'
            - relatedly, identifying the 'high variation variable sets that most often oppose/contradict each other' are useful as 'default variable sets to connect'
        - relatedly, identifying 'functions that seemed to have an error but were correct' is useful to identify high variation variables like 'combinations/sequences of metrics/filters/systems/inputs' that are incorrect, which identifies 'high amounts of info from one specific error type' which is generally useful to identify variants of
        - relatedly, identifying 'functions with hidden variation' like a 'highly standardized function that contains useful variation like waves in a degree that would be missed by nontrivial ratios of representation functions' is useful to identify as a 'difference in a similarity structure' that can 'generate other differences while obscuring the cause/sequence', where 'obscured causes/unconnectible sequences' are a common error structure to apply differences to resolve
        - relatedly, identifying 'more important errors to correct' like 'missing relevance structures like missing requirements/definitions/solution metrics/connection functions' and 'trivially identified, non-trivially corrected errors' and 'other differences from known useful structures like variables of relevance' is useful as a general problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying 'limits/structures of relevance of variables like reducibility/connectivity' are useful to identify as 'determinants of the relevance of interaction functions of reductions/connections' (how limited a structure's relevance is determines how it can interact with the relevance of other structures)
        - relatedly, error structures like 'error types' have default/probable interactions like 're-occurring/repeating', such as how 'errors of missing info tend to create other errors of other missing info', which is useful to identify 'error connections/networks'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'highest variation networks that a function should be compared to or filtered by' (like 'validity networks', 'law networks', 'ethics/human rights networks', 'certainty networks') are useful to identify the minimum variation required for a reality-reflecting network

    - identify useful structures like interface structures that determine a problem such as 'default relevance structures' like 'false similarities that can lead to errors like hiding causal sequences' or 'cases that maximize relevance of a variable' and identify how these can be connected to 'identify causal variables' and 'connect to workflows' and other general problem-solving intents
        - for example, identifying that 'lack of required change in a set of variables' can look like an 'irrelevant set of variables', which is useful to identify when there is a causal sequence (like in addition, where 'some examples wont require changing all the digits' bc they dont always contain values other than zero, but its still useful to 'identify the one digit as the starting point of a causal sequence of base changes', as well as identifying that a 'change to the one digit can change any of the others in some cases like "adjacencies to a base change in the biggest digit"' (similar to how its useful to identify the 'standard-switching cases' determining standard/digit relevance and the 'limits of possible relevance of a change')
            - these are useful for being 'default meaning/relevance structures' which are generally useful to identify, similar to how 'identify causal variables' is generally useful to identify, which can be applied to filter interface queries to identify the most relevant structures
        - similarly, identifying other 'false similarities' and other interface structures are useful to identify possible errors, as well as identifying the 'standard/base change of the causal sequence that can invalidate solving by iteration'
        - identifying that 'false similarities can lead to errors like "hiding causal sequences" (by creating a false similarity between "lack of change in some cases" and "general irrelevance")' is useful to identify, since these structures are non-trivial to connect in some cases, except by that specific route ('by creating a false similarity') for example
        - relatedly, identifying how workflow structures interact like how 'base changes invalidate iterations' is useful to identify as a core connection between workflows like 'change a base solution' and 'trial and error'
        - relatedly, identifying how structures seem 'comparatively real' in some cases like where they are 'more usefully unique' is useful to identify 'relativity of reality'
        - relatedly, identifying alignments/connections/incompleteness between different structures (like how the 'relevance spectrum/network' and the 'uncertainty space described by similarity indexes' have an 'incomplete alignment' in the 'linearity/randomness spectrum') is useful to identify 'structures that can reduce uncertainties or fulfill other problem-solving intents' (which identifies general problem-solving intents like 'reduce uncertainties in the uncertainty space, by applying relevance spectrums, bc of their alignment in their linearity/randomness spectrum')
        - relatedly, identifying 'base-changing changes/cases/variables/types/structures' as useful to identify as "determining variables of when a workflow like 'change a base solution' can be useful/useless" (when a 'base-changing case applies, changing a base solution may not be useful')
        - relatedly, identifying 'validity type interactions/differences/overlaps/structures (as in, "it may be technically valid in some way, but it decreases general meaning which is connected to validity")' is useful as 'relevance component (such as validity) interactions'
        - relatedly, 'variants of bases to identify useful functions for' (like bases such as a function compared to other functions in general, functions compared to valid systems, functions compared to errors, function subsets compared to each other, functions compared to known biased functions like over-simplifications or randomness)
        - relatedly, 'different differences' like 'distant derivatives' and 'iterated derivatives' and 'system/set/matrix derivatives' are useful to identify as useful default comparison implementation structures to incorporate into interface queries (since 'determining a difference between complex structures' is likely to be useful across problems and some derivative comparison structures are likelier to be useful based on the problem variables like complexity, so 'identify a way to use an iterated derivative of a matrix given the matching complexity of this problem of resolving types which makes that difference structure likely to be useful in some way like by reducing/standardizing differences to make comparisons more trivial/simple and relevant')
        - relatedly, identifying "variables/structures that change 'meaning/truth/relevance structures' like 'combinations' as in 'truth and relevance' of a structure" are useful to identify, such as how 'sequences are the most useful structure' has general interface counterpoints like 'differences from difference/meaning/definition networks are the most useful structure' or 'similarity indexes of similarity indexes are the most useful structure', which seem 'more true and useful' bc they 'specify a way to contain more variation in a useful way' (like by 'containing a comparison and a self-reference structure') and specific interface counterpoints like 'time is not purely sequential, as there is an incompleteness reflecting a ratio of difference that allows other change types to be relevant, and also useful reality-reflecting structures need to reflect different change types like different base changes like different types of time'
        - relatedly, identifying 'error-switching functions' to apply in interface queries to correct for some error in a workflow once it occurs, if not preventable (such as 'missing abstraction errors') like where an error in 'predicted speed of problem-solving as in speed of finding a solution' occurs, so switching to another problem-solving workflow once 'this error in speed estimation occurs from the original workflow' is useful to identify, such as 'identify the cause of the error like "over-simplification" such as by "over-applying constants like constant speed of problem-solving, if other problems were solved quickly", and the opposing variable to correct it, like "switching to a higher variation/relevance/complexity workflow or a workflow that is known to specifically avoids/corrects this error"'

    - identify useful structures like 'variable isolations that create certainty structures' and 'connections between these un/certainty structures like ways to extend certainty structures' and what intents are implemented by them
        - for example, identifying that there are 'optimal subsets of a set of routes' (such as a variable like a 'rights violation' and a set of costs/errors 'cost when not violating is wrong (reversible low cost)' vs. 'cost when violating is wrong (irreversible high cost)' associated with errors from either variable value 'violating/not violating' when applied) is useful to identify 'certainty structures' like 'sequence of variable values, costs, and defined optimals/errors' like 'irreversible high cost errors' and 'reversible low cost errors', which are useful to identify similar un/certainty structures as well as their interface structures like their connections, their optimal connections, and their optimal areas to avoid, etc
            - relatedly, additional variables can be applied to the certainty structure of this 'sequence of variable values, costs, and defined optimals/errors' without violating its certainty (to reach a farther-reaching certainty structure that is more trivial to connect to other structures) or to identify structures to base uncertainties on to resolve uncertainties, where these 'sequences of variable values, costs, and defined optimals/errors' act like 'unit neural networks'
            - relatedly, identifying contradictions of certain connections is useful to prioritize identifying first (identifying errors in certainty structures is high priority to identify structures that shouldnt be changed)
        - deriving filters from variables of other filters (given that this filter can identify a subset, what other variables are likely to be relevant) and identify filter networks to identify filter sequences like 'solutions that are more adjacent to optimal solutions bc of the variable set applied to identify them'
            - relatedly, identifying when "'generative/filter variables' or other vertex variables are extremely different" is useful bc it indicates alternate sets of variables for the generated/filtered structure

    - identify useful structures like 'missing info' like 'lack of self-evaluation or lack of default evaluation' that makes some valuable info like 'useful/powerful variables' (like frequent default variables) similarly trivial to apply the same error to (misidentify or missing powerful variables)
        - for example, useful structures can also be useful for creating/causing errors/removing probabilities of solutions, so identifying ways that useful structures like 'iterations or maximal differences' can cause errors like 'crossing thresholds' is useful as well as ways to prevent applications of useful structures in ways that could create/cause errors or make errors required by leaving them as the only remaining option or the only remaining adjacent/useful option
            - this is bc errors 'reflect similarities applied to them' (when an input is missing, this is reflected across the similarity applied by the function to its similarly missing output), which results from a 'gap in evaluation application' (the default variables are used but not evaluated), which implies that every core function (like evaluate, compare, standardize, optimize, apply) can be applied to correct for 'missing info' errors (and same for other error types)
        - relatedly, 'attention' is useful only as a 'local/output signal', where in a general context, attention is the output/result of other more useful structures like frequency/probability which have to be applied as well or the attention would never reflect the truth (if I hadnt made interface analysis well-defined and useful and trivial and structural, there would never have been attention paid to it, which is obvious when you look at problem-solving in general and how infrequently anyone ever even wondered how to structure these abstract info structures or noticed the abstract connections that turned out to be true)
            - saying 'attention' is the only important variable is like saying 'hindsight/outputs are all that is required'
        - relatedly, being able to solve like by 'filling in' errors of interface queries like 'missing info errors' is useful, once 'interface queries with errors like lack of specificity or other incompleteness for an intent' are identified
        - relatedly, identifying structures adjacent to errors (rather than only inputs of errors) are useful to identify as possible unidentified connections to errors, like how errors can happen when there is a 'lack of evaluation/filtering/limiting functions to prevent errors', so 'areas without evaluation/filtering/limiting functions' are likelier than other structures to 'be or be adjacent to errors'
        - the fact that 'attention' is one degree away from the more powerful causal variable may make it seem useful through this adjacence which preserves some similarity to the powerful input, but that misses the dependence on the more powerful variable and the lack of alternate structures to identify the powerful variables when theyre not being paid attention to
            - this is made obvious by applying an 'extreme difference' of scale to scale out and identify other more relevant variables, and identify ways the 'connection to outputs like attention' might be contradicted/opposed, which is a way to identify the 'errors of other network types'
        - relatedly, given that errors can be caused/created by 'requiring' them, identifying ways that errors can be required like 'solutions have been prevented/filtered out, leaving only errors remaining' is useful, and identifying 'filters that would exclude solutions' are useful to identify as 'possible error causes'
        - relatedly, identifying 'relevant error structures' is useful to filter interface queries, like how the following interface query has variation in its interim structures:
            - identify errors (implying all errors)
               - identify a 'subset of errors' or identify 'inputs of error sequences' and the 'positions/thresholds/ranges where those inputs become errors' and identify 'limits/opposing functions/structures of error sequences'
                    - interim section here, allowing for specification of relevance of errors using abstract variables
                        - 'identify relevant errors' (errors that are 'possible/probable/measurable/identifiable/changeable/fixable')
                            - 'identify filters of relevant errors'
                                - 'identify errors causes that could be similar/relevant to other recent changes, if there were recent changes, so the errors are likelier to be relevant'
                                - 'identify common inputs across multiple error types'
                                - 'identify volatile errors'
                                - 'identify permanent errors likely to require manual intervention to fix or likely to be fixed with an accessible/default operation like a restart/synchronization/update'
                    - these errors filters can be used to 'filter interface queries' so the queries can find these errors fulfilling these filters (and oppose them by applying changes to the errors to find solutions)
        - relatedly, 'validity' is a 'complex variable' (despite the simplicity of its similarity-based definition as a 'similarity to a system') creating a 'hard problem' where examples/specifications of this variable can be contradicted with trivial changes (almost any system can be trivially changed to be invalid or contradict/neutralize itself), so 'identifying/solving validity and other hard problems (like creating the most valid system with the highest variation)' is useful as a general problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying error structures is useful like how 'identifying cases where applying a connection like "some variable connection is correct" as an "absolute fact" could cause other errors if false' can be structured like where "there are only two alternatives, one of which is extremely negative/costly (its either true or extremely incorrect) and would cause other errors" and "the alternatives available at that point, whether the connection is true or false, would likely cause other errors or are similarly limited/negative or worse, bc the error is in an error range/area/grid/network"
            - relatedly, identifying the errors of structures like networks involves identifying cases where their structures can be improved for some intent (like how a standard neural network applies an incorrect assumption of one connection possible between nodes, where in reality, many connections are possible/valid/useful between variables)
        - relatedly, identifying where a 'general/abstract' solution can be useful is useful (such as how its often more valuable to identify where there is a general increase or sustained increase rather than to identify the specific slope of the increase)
        - relatedly, identifying how many 'degrees/types of difference' to apply to what structure before a structure like a 'filter' can be invalidated by identifying its 'alternates in intent/other invalidating structures' is useful (such as to invalidate a filter by identifying degrees to apply in a direction in a causal sequence starting from the 'filter' position that intersect with a different intent invalidating the filter, like generative variables of useful structures)
            - relatedly, as indicated elsewhere, identifying the specifications/differences that connect useful structures and their examples, like the previous connection, to identify 'specifications that lead to errors, already identified or over-simplistic or otherwise useless solutions or other meaningless structures rather than useful examples of a structure' are useful as implementation structures/filters
            - relatedly, examples are useful as 'pre-filtered subsets of an abstract structure' and as 'reasons to justify additional filtering' and as 'indications of probabilities of similar useful structures in the set', which its useful to index examples as being relevant to specific interface query structures (like how are examples useful for core functions like 'filter') to make identifying useful structures for interface queries trivial, beyond their definitions

    - identify useful structures like 'interface structures with variables that are useful to vary/hold constant for some intent' like 'oppose errors in structures of interface queries' using structures like 'variables of indexes of interface queries' and 'variables of workflows that identify useful structures like sequences'
        - for example, identifying 'optimizations to intelligence' could take the highly structural form of 'extended/increased neuron parameters like neuron count', which can be applied to fulfill higher complexity functions (such as 'identify the meaning as in the net impact of abstraction combined with potential') more trivially, which can also be implemented by applying other interface structures rather than highly structural solutions like 'neuron count increases'
            - these other interface structures include for example, identifying 'variables of indexes of interface queries' that are useful across problems, or identifying the 'core example to base a perspective application on, that connects lower-complexity states with a reason to justify the higher complexity change bc of its specificity, an example which acts as a useful counterpoint to various errors' (like a case where iterations of iteration workflows found a useful iteration type/pattern, or where a problem occurred in some interface query field that is resolvable with some opposing structure), as well as 'unique identifiers/limits of workflows' and 'pre-computed unchangeable meanings such as pre-computed irreversibility meanings')
            - identifying where 'optimizations' havent been applied in some interface variant (some point in between highly structural forms and other forms like pre-computation or indexing or identifying unlimited/irreversible/etc structures/directions of variation/specificity/etc) is similarly useful
            - relatedly, identifying the structures like position where variables like specificity are missing is a matter of identifying complexity/ambiguity in identifying meaning, like the point in an iteration where 'indexes of indexes of indexes of interface queries' become difficult to compute the meaning of bc of their lack of specificity (indexes acting like abstractions in this case and having similar 'probable errors' or 'iteration errors' like 'missing info'), and similarly, identifying index iterations that dont lose meaning computability are similarly useful to identify, like iterations that index 'interface structures with some regular specificity ratio'
        - relatedly, the variables of workflows like core functions can be varied in a way that identifies useful structures like intersections of workflow variants, limits of workflow variants, and directions of irreversibilities like over-specificity, which is useful to identify structures like 'input/output sequences' in this workflow graph, such as identifying that 'filter base solutions' is a precursor to 'change base solutions', which is useful to identify when a workflow is more trivial to apply than other workflows, like identifying whether the 'filtering' has already been computed or is trivial to compute
        - relatedly, identifying an 'error cause' is possible if there is an 'error type/cause index of possible error types that is filterable (some are possible/probable/testable), these types adding filtering/specificity that is useful for its connected sequences being testable', as opposed to 'tracing the sequence an error occurs in a process in a log' (rather than 'identifying the last message that succeeded before an error, indicating the error position, which can be used to identify error causes at that position' or 'identifying the cause of a specific error from a specific error message', approach it from a different angle of "filtering pre-filtered errors as in 'pre-filters as types' of possible errors and test the 'types of these types' like 'system update' to identify the abstract/type cause and filtering out the abstract type by changing its cause" or "identifying 'trivial sets' or 'reduced size, high variation structures' or 'trivial difference, extreme similarity' structures as useful to iterate, which would identify an error/cause index as useful" or "identifying the similar/different signals of 'types of causes of errors' of an index and filtering by testing each similarity/difference that covers the most cause types")
            - relatedly, identifying whether some info is useful as an alternate set reflecting some similarity/difference structure is a matter of identifying whether it can be 'connected with trivial changes' such as how 'small high variation sets' reflect very few variables in common with an error/cause index and the reason to use a particular small high variation set is removed compared to the specific error/cause index, but these happen to be generally relevant variables to have in common and the functions required to 'identify the reasons to use a set and apply it for that reason' (meaning how to identify how to use an item in the set, such as to 'extrapolating sequences from a cause/error index to identify testable/common/similar/different/possible sequences/nodes' are trivial
        - identifying 'variation required in a solution or variation in a solution definition' is useful to identify 'similarly variable structures' and apply them as 'default solution sets' like identifying whether available functions have enough variation to solve the problem in n steps or whether it has to be higher than n, and whether there are 'infinite unsolvability cycles' where a 'vacillation between solution/error states can continue indefinitely'
        - relatedly, as referenced elsewhere, identifying high priority errors is useful, like 'ways that a simple structure can be a complex structure' (like where iterations are applied to the simple structure and computation capacity is high) is useful to identify (its more useful to identify complex errors)
        - relatedly, as referenced elsewhere, identifying why neural network structures like 'change combinations' can be both correct/incorrect is useful like how neural networks can be used to find all possible interactions given the 'definition of interactions, which involves change combinations' but only some interactions will be 'adjacent to simulate with some connection type/potential/combination/sequence', whereas 'other interactions might never be found bc a simpler/more adjacent variant might always be found first from any direction/position', and where some network configurations/functions that only 'learn specific indexes' can only find specific interactions like 'specific numerical additions' by identifying 'all the other specific numerical additions or the adjacent/similar additions' which requires either 'infinite computation or identifying all the difference types required between added inputs' to cover all input cases or can only find specific similarities to training interactions, and where "other network configurations will never find some solutions from a starting point bc of the 'size in changes applied' or the 'limits on this size'"
            - this is basically a problem of identifying structures that are 'non-adjacent to find for some algorithm/starting point'
            - relatedly, identifying 'equivalent alternates' in neural networks like in 'equally irrelevant subsets/nodes' is useful for intents like 'apply a change in some position, like an error position, without changing too many subsequent interactions' (which follows from intents like 'identify error position'), as these 'irrelevant structures (or specifically/locally/minimally relevant)' are useful to change when theyre in an error state
        - relatedly, identifying the structure/position/size of variation is useful, like identifying whether a 'new connection/variable/graph' is likely to be required to solve a problem

    - identifying useful structures like specific graph variants or combinations that are useful in implementing or connecting with another useful structure like a 'change type creating a new neural network by applying a similarity with an identified reason for its usefulness'
        - for example, 'spiral changes' can identify more interaction types bc they allow more interactions, applying a 'rotation' to cause/position of a set of structures to cover all their possible interactions in a system/causal network (identifying where A causes B, A is independent of B, and where B causes A, and where they apply a cycle, etc can be done by switching their positions/angles/distances, which can be done with a spiral more trivially than other functions), as an alternate neural network that identifies variable interaction structures with more dimensions to their interactions, allowing identification of 'multiple polynomials indicating these alternate interactions'
        - this is related to how there are likely 'multiple useful/true/valid/relevant ways A could and could not cause B', which is useful to identify similarity indexes and interfaces of (similarity indexes of 'relevant/useful/valid/true connections')
        - relatedly, other structures like limits/barriers/filters/opposites/efficiencies should be integrated to filter these changes in a useful way (where can spirals be optimized like by skipping levels, what typically blocks a full spiral, when are waves more relevant to apply)
        - relatedly, the 'set of graphs that cover the accurate/useful changes of these rotations, changes specifically between positions/distances/angles' is useful to identify, to enable identifying other changes like the graph queries that cover more variable interactions (like 'starting from this graph, most variable interactions stay within n degrees on this graph similarity index')
        - this is relevant bc similar to how there are ways a connection can be true or false, there are ways interface connections can be true or false, such as how there are ways A can cause B and ways that B can cause A bc the interface connection 'A causes B' can be true or false in various ways, and the same applies to other interface connections, and identifying 'higher ratios of truth/relevance/usefulness' in these connections can identify default interface queries applying these 'higher truth ratio connections' as the core similarities/differences driving interface queries (as a result of a core difference to resolve by connecting or a difference to create/maximize by reducing/filter, etc)
        - relatedly, a 'specificity similarity' can be a useful 'interface similarity type', which implements a cross-interface structure that is useful for interface queries that apply a similarity, similar to how a 'intersection of spectrums' is useful for identifying the interactions of two spectrums (like abstract/specific and constant/variable) bc of their points of intersection/similarity which are likely to be useful as a structure to base interface queries on like to 'apply integration points where sub-interface queries can be merged into original queries' since intersections of these spectrums can align with intersections of queries and a set of spectrums is likely to be useful as a default structure for queries to be based on, given the 'different similarities' implemented by 'intersecting spectrums'
        - relatedly, identifying all the perspectives/graphs where identified useful structures are adjacent to identify is useful as a 'default set of perspectives to apply changes to and identify positions/interactions of, such as which perspectives oppose or are adjacent to each other, and apply as a limiting system on interface queries'
        - relatedly, a 'describe/summarize, then filter' workflow is useful for pre-filtering a solution set before applying the filter, as a useful 'compounding function sequence', similar to how other 'extreme variable filters' like independence/power/abstraction/extremes as 'extremes of different difference types' are useful to pre-filter the solution set (differentiate by applying differences such as extremes, at which point filtering should be more trivial)
        - relatedly, identifying how find/generate/build can connect to similarities/differences and other standard interface structures (for example, 'find similarities by removing differences') is useful for 'integrating/filtering interface queries'

    - identify useful structures like new connections between similarities/differences, problems/solutions, and interface queries like 'sub-queries of an interface query, sub-problems of a problem, sub-types of a type, and sub-interfaces on an interface'
        - for example, identifying that 'structures which are difficult to differentiate (as in they have an ambiguous similarity or their differences are non-obvious)' could be 'a set of structures having similar types' or a 'set of structures having high variation variables which will necessarily seem similar using a high ratio of similarity metrics' is useful to align 'similarities across interface structure sets' ('comparable structures', 'structures its useful to differentiate' and 'structures having similar types'), where the interface similarity will cross some high variation threshold ('sets/types' crossing a 'high variation threshold' separating 'sets having different types' and 'sets having similar types' which are possibilities that are 'similar in probability', unlike 'types having similar types', so connections across this threshold are useful since the mapping is so different from 1-to-1), so connecting a structure to a specific high variation similarity structure like a 'connection between 1-to-1 mappings' or a 'connection between overlapping extremes on an interface like abstract/specific' is useful to identify as a problem/similarity index, to identify "symmetries/similarities that have the variation and connection/similarity to solve a specific problem", since once this is identified, identifying the rest of the interface query (as in the sub-problems to solve) is a matter of identifying "what similarity/differences are problematic or probable on that interface", which is likely already known
            - this means identifying the 'core interface/symmetry containing most of the variation to resolve for a specific problem' and then identifying the rest of the query based on changes to that interface (like sub-interfaces as sub-problems)
            - this doesnt mean just defining the problem but identifying the relevant difference of the problem (as in solving a problem like 'do these structures have this type of interaction' by identifying their 'probable intersection/overlap points' as being the relevant difference of the problem as in 'are these intersection/overlap points actually valid' rather than the original problem statement, which is more relevant through specificity)
            - relatedly, 'specific variants of every possible connection' are useful as possible 'relevance structures' in this way, similar to how applying other structures can make a query/connection more relevant
            - relatedly, the structure of a 'question/query' is basically similar to a 'connection', except it allows for 'interim' structures between the nodes of the connection, as in 'are there barriers in between these nodes, preventing this connection, or are there coordinating structures that enable the connection' (when a query says 'is a connectible to b using c', its saying, 'is c in between a and b' or 'can c be between a and b' as in 'can c convert a into b', and when a query says 'find filters of b', its saying 'find structures in between b and some other structure' or 'find a filter in between the abstract filter and b that is similar to the abstract filter and similar to b'), as opposed to 'connections' like true/false statements which indicate a defined/direct connection (like 'a is not b (meaning a is opposite of or independent of b)', and 'there is no way to connect a and b directly with any interim structure set, as a and b are so independent that they will never even be in the same direction/system/graph'), which is like saying 'find the connection between these' or 'find the useful interaction between these' for any set of structures in a specific query
            - the default/core problem to resolve which can be applied as a default query is the 'dependence similarity' as in 'are these variables directly or indirectly connectible' which identifies other problems like 'are all independent variables trivially connectible' and interim problems like 'how to change in/dependent variables across these dependence/connectivity types', after which identifying the in/dependence of a variable set to resolve the 'dependence similarity' problem, other queries are more trivial like specifying embedded variables on the similarity/difference interface, like which type of in/dependence is relevant, where 'similarities of other powerful/determining/base variables' can similarly be applied as default or 'maximally filtering' queries
            - relatedly, identifying the 'independence inputs' like 'barriers/limits/other isolation structures and multi-functionality/similar inputs/components of independence' are useful to identify these 'independences between variables' as well as their opposing structures (dependence inputs) and orthogonal structures of independence (what makes independence irrelevant, such as in/dependence inputs or in/dependence-changing variables or alternatives to in/dependence or invalidators of in/dependence or similarly high variation variables like determining variables on other interfaces than causal interface structures like independence)
            - relatedly, identifying the 'maximally different' structures of independence like the 'simplest independent connections' (applying a non-1-to-1 concept like complexity to independence) is useful to apply as a default useful structure (the simplest most independent connections are the most useful connections)
        - relatedly, identifying 'more computible structures' is useful to identify structures to standardize/connect/similarize to in order to make some other structure more computible, and relatedly, 'identifying the structures that should always be trivial to compute' and 'making them trivial to compute with pre-computed indexes or interfaces' are useful as general problem-solving intent sets
        - relatedly, now that 'similarity indexes of interface structures' is trivial to identify (a 'structure/average/position' similarity, a 'maximal cross-interface' similarity, etc), connecting the problems associated with these similarity types in a problem/similarity index is useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying that 'focus' applies changes/variation to a structure, identifying how adjacent a space/set/structure is to a possible value like true/false is useful to predict the likely value from various possible states and focus applications of variation by connecting it to adjacent structures like 'higher ratios of false values, given adjacent/probable changes applied with focus to a set of adjacent/probable states'

    - identify useful structures like 'input subset interactions' which are measurable in other ways like the '"completeness" of the subset interactions identified' (such as that a ratio of 'completeness of inputs tested' can be identified) which makes it possible to derive other insights about the 'input interations'
        - for example, identifying 'why some vitamins cant be taken at the same time' is a matter of identifying insights from 'subset interactions' such as that 'not all compounds are processed to or usable at the same interaction level (there is variation in processing size)', 'some compound interactions invalidate each other (there is variation in functionality when used in specific ways)', 'some compound interactions like bonds as in "structure fits" can invalidate other external structures like processing functions (there is variation in functionality of interactive structures when used in specific ways)', and 'not every error has a handling solution function at every scope/position/structure of the error', all of which are 'interactions that apply to "subsets of inputs" bc of "allowed variation in inputs"', and identifying these abstract connections in a 'measurable subset of a system' can identify/derive 'causes/variables/structures in unmeasurable subsets', and identifying 'whether some structure is a set or subset' is useful for related intents like 'identify position/structures of variation'
        - relatedly, identifying the problem/question that 'contains enough variation to be useful to apply changes to, to find new useful structures like workflows' like 'whether there must be more ways for a known connection be true, in a high variation problem space like biology, and where the connection is quite common, so as to be worth applying more changes to, to find other relevant variables, as this problem is likely to contain new variation not already described by existing problem-solving structures', where 'identifying new differences as in problems' is useful as a specific variant of 'identify new variation', since all problems can be connected with existing workflows but for new different problems, new workflows are likely to be more adjacently useful bc of the 'symmetry in differences between new/existing problems and new/existing workflows to solve them'
        - identifying obviously wrong functions like 'making the problem worse to solve it' is useful to identify as a 'default query set to avoid or apply differences to' and also identify the edge cases where they are relevant (like where making the problem worse triggers alarms that trigger functions to solve it), which is possible bc of the 'clear errors/optimals' as a result of definitions (bc problems are not optimal and solutions are optimal, making them less optimal is unlikely to create a solution)
            - relatedly, another example of an 'obvious wrong' given some definition is to 'apply standards to the solution', as if the problem is that the solution doesnt have standards, when the problem is likelier to be that the problem structure doesnt have standards
        - relatedly, a useful problem-solving intent is 'identifying new ways to use existing functions/structures' like 'applying changes to existing functions/structures until they implement or are adjacent to some useful structure'
        - relatedly, identifying 'reversible sequences' and other contradictory structures (a reversible sequence is one where order is variably relevant) is useful to create other useful structures like 'alternates' (from varied order of reversibility)
            - for example, identifying the 'useful/relevant reversibility' of intent sequences like 'identify, then change' and 'change, then identify' is useful for identifying 'high variation functions which have probably useful interactions in any sequence/structure'
            - this is bc identifying useful structures/variants of other variables (like 'reversibility') is similarly useful ('useful validity', as a 'meaningful variant of the structure of validity'), which applies to simple structures like the 'reverse' function as well as other interface structures like function variables such as 'volatility/validity'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'abstract routes as in "useful similarities/differences" to the "similarity/difference required for some intent"' can be pre-computed ('identifying the similarities/differences to create some similarity for some intent' can be determined for each intent/similarity or intent/difference set, just like identifying 'intent/requirement' similarities can be pre-computed, where the remaining variation between requirements/similarities is determined by these two indexes)

    - identify useful structures like 'increasing variation' and 'error sequences' and patterns such as 'alternations between extremes' which when combined can determine other useful structures like 'probable optimal sequences', since optimal sequences dont avoid errors completely but rather identify them the quickest
        - for example, identifying 'higher probability sequences' as sequences that 'avoid probable error sequences' (like how over-prioritization errors are likelier to occur after iterations and missing info errors are likelier to occur after other errors like 'disorganization or incomplete indexing') or are "more complete in some way like 'crossing higher ratios of concepts'" which is useful to identify bc its a way to apply structures by default to identify new variation, like by 'iterating structures until an error type is identified', at which point some other navigation/compression/definition/interface function can be applied to 'optimize past/future paths', like by 'distributing luck' by 'increasing probability of paths' to avoid 'identifying probabilities of paths', since an 'alternating/regular sequence of solutions/errors' exists in many graphs, especially those which alternate other related but indirectly mappable variables like 'constants/variables'
        - identifying sets of related problem/solution concepts like 'useful/accurate/good/right/optimal' is useful to resolve mappings/barriers/overlaps between them, like how some structure can be all of 'accurate and very negative and good in that its useful and also not right/optimal', and identifying these possible combinations/structures is useful to identify 'probabilities/requirements/connections/structures of these combinations/structures' (identifying the probability of accurate/negative/useful, accurate/useful/optimal, etc) as well as identifying the useful questions like 'are there always multiple optimal points possible/generatable/default in a problem space' and optimization opportunities like identifying whether a 'accurate/negative/useful' structure can be optimized to a 'accurate/negative/useful/optimal' structure and identifying the concepts that make these optimizations trivial, as a way to connect problem/solution structures by their various structures like variables by identifying other interface variables like probabilities of these problem/solution structures to predict their position/relevance to a problem space (as opposed to 'identifying simple problem/solution input/output connection sequences for specific problem spaces')
        - identifying the 'maximally different error structures adjacent to solution structures', like where there is 'one error in a field of solutions' or 'extreme volatility in optimality', is useful to identify as 'worst case scenarios' of problem/solution structures, compared to 'clearly different/simple solution areas'
        - identifying useful questions like 'is a clear optimal structure like "combinations of perpendicular/parallel structures" ever not optimal' as being 'obvious/adjacent questions (generatable with a trivial opposite applied to a simple structure like a "clear optimal") with non-obvious answers' which is useful to identify the uncertainties leading to non-obviousness, such as "lack of description of solution structures (like required possibilities) and the 'probabilities of those required possibilities'"
        - relatedly, identifying various structures of "relevance/usage of ratios" (like 'probabilities' as in a ratio on a 'specific standardized spectrum', 'ranges', 'angles', 'thresholds', 'filters/selections') and their connections/structures as well as different/opposing structures (like structures that can change a ratio into another structure like an equivalence or a 1-to-1 connection, or scalars) is useful
            - given that ratios are a relevant structure of a core function like division, identifying what other core functions have similar associated structures is useful (like the 'endpoints as in starting point and convergence' of arithmetic series corresponding in meaning/usefulness to the 'ratio' of a division) as identifying their connections ('ranges like between endpoints' can be represented as 'ratios')
            - given that ratios represent a base/standard and can be applied as a unit of a standard, identifying other structures of standards is useful to identify (like "non-based/standardized/equivalent alternate" comparison structures like 'local/relative change', where the similarity of a 'different third base' provides an 'equivalent alternate' to 'using the same base' and where 'local comparisons' can be an alternative to 'absolute comparisons' or 'similar contexted-comparisons' bc of the relevance of interface spectrums like 'abstract/specific' in determining similarities that can be applied as standards/bases)
            - given that ratios as 'bases' represent a core structure that appears in workflows ('change a base solution'), identifying the variants/index/structures of these structure/workflow connections is useful

    - identify useful structures like 'indirect connections' that can be used trivially to identify new useful structures like 'different default interface query sets'
        - for example, identifying the 'positions of variation/information' required to solve a problem is similar to identifying the 'positions of specification' required to solve a problem, which is an 'indirect connection (indirect as in not defined)', since specifying a general problem-solving intent connects the intent to its specific implementation
            - as a result, 'specification sequences' in general and 'specification sequences of abstract concepts' and 'specification sequences of general problem-solving intents (or other solution bases or problem-solving starting points)' are useful as 'default interface query sets'
        - relatedly, identifying 'combinations like ratios of specification/variation (as different variants of information, one acting like a limit/filter, and the other acting like a generator)' are useful, similar to how identifying different similarity/difference structures or other opposing structures like generate/filter are useful
        - given that 'alternating abstraction/specification structures' are likelier to be useful than a complete specification sequence except for intents like "identify the specification limit" or "identify specific implementations of a concept", identifying what other structures of differences than 'vacillations/iterations' are likely to be more useful is a useful intent (embeddings, connections with other sequences, differences from other sequences like 'volatilizations/invalidations of other sequences', etc)
        - relatedly, identifying the 'most surprising (as in maximally different) structure' is often a variable changed by position/angle/distance but there are structures which are surprising independently, regardless of position, such as structures which can support more changes and which apply more changes compared to other structures, and identifying these 'acontextual' structural variables is useful as well as identifying structures which change in different structures of contexts like 'grids of contexts' and 'networks of contexts' and at 'one position in one graph of contexts', etc, which identifies the 'potential of a structure' and similarly, applying this to contexts is useful such as by identifying 'contexts of contexts' like 'contexts in which a context is useful such as maximally different' and 'potential of contexts' like the 'most contexts in which a context can be useful'
        - relatedly, identifying 'connections between structures of opposites' like structures like 'connections/combinations' of the 'most extended/changed/opposing/contradicting variant of a definition' is likely to be useful in 'identifying new variation sources' such as 'roots of infinities' (positions/contexts where infinities are basically zero) being possibly defined but unlikely to be as defined as other structures, and connecting these 'improbably or less defined/valid structures' with each other and with defined structures is likely to identify other errors/limits/variables as well as identifying error directions and other error variables
        - relatedly, identifying connection between structures like 'cycles and causes of cycles' is useful to connect to interfaces like problem/solution structures like 'errors', such as how 'extreme/over-prioritization/imbalanced ratio errors' cause cycles (like over-specification leading to over-abstraction at various points/intervals/other structures such as by 'over-specifying types' or by 'over-specifying as in over-filtering, which is similar to over-removing variables, which is similar to abstraction', or over-stacking leading to invalidation of the stack such as how 'adding some info can remove other info by invalidating it'), as a result of the cycle in this spectrum and caused by the 'adjacency to "chaos" of an error' (any error that is too extreme will apply "chaos" which leads to other errors, including the opposite of the original error), and as a way to determine limits of a particular structure (only so much can be applied until additional iterations are self-limiting), as well as identifying 'self-contained' structures like 'interfaces that describe themselves', as reality can only occur within 'some ratio/range of the abstract network' but there may be other networks beyond the chaos outside of this network, and there may be ways to change this network that will invalidate some of the chaos, thereby 'reducing the distance to or building connections to other networks', so identifying the 'specification sequences that avoid over-specification/abstraction errors/paths to chaos' are useful to identify 
        - similarly, 'identifying new variation' can be a matter of identifying 'points that are actually more accurately described as lines/grids/networks/sequences/fields' which is related to why identifying the 'plane position of a problem, where a problem is a point on a plane' is useful as a problem-solving intent as well as "other 'dimenion-count' changes and other dimenion structure changes" which are alternate problem-solving intents
        - relatedly, reasons for more/less useful structures like 'combinations of variables/infinite iterations' and 'conceptual ratio error' structures like 'generating/requesting more than needed/earned' are useful to identify
        - relatedly, 'identify required variation' is possible to implement with a workflow like 'change a base solution' ('requirements' being the useful 'base' to change) which is an index its useful to identify, as well as other related indexes like 'equivalent variation' which identifies structure sets like 'scope/scale' and 'count/scope' as similarly variable/powerful and useful to apply in positions of interface queries where variation is required, as well as other general problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation' and 'identify equal variation' which can map to workflows

    - identify useful structures like 'connections between structure variables' that are likely 'relevant to many connections/changes' and therefore likely to be useful as 'default interface queries'
        - for example, the 'volatility' variable of a 'sequence' and the 'additivity' variable of a 'set' are variables of these structures that are likely to be useful to identify connections between the variables, since these connections are useful for changing/identifying intents like 'whether some subset of a data set is a "set of overlapping interactions of some variables in common" and some other subset of the data set is a "sequence of possible adjacent states"'
            - these connections are also likely to explain other variable interactions, so theyre likelier to fulfill general problem-solving intents involving cross-interface or multi-functionality variables
            - identifying 'relevant sets' of a data set like the 'sets of sequences that are likely to occur in real systems' and the sets that are 'unlikely to occur in the same sequence' can be identified by these set/sequence varaible connections
            - these variables are likely to have some possible 'definition overlap' that indicates realistic sequences as in 'probable/possible change sequences that are likely to occur between real sets/sequences' which makes these variable connections useful as default interface queries
            - this is useful to identify as 'differences from function (input/output sequence) variables (like volatility)', which has a definition for 'adjacent ordered items' like 'points in a function input/output set (relevant to input sequences as opposed to input/output sequences)' but not necessarily for an 'unordered set' except for cases where other concepts are applied like where 'random selections from the set are more volatile than not' or where 'a set is required to have some order/position in implementations and this order can be volatile', so identifying "how a function variable like 'volatility' can apply to other structures and which concepts allow the most of these cross-structure definitions" is useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying new cases where its 'impossible/probable to know only after its useful to know', or where "concepts like 'entropy/momentum' overlap with interface structures like 'intent'", or where "useful structures like 'find/identify' are the problem" is useful for 'adjacently identifying new variables', or where "some function prevents another function from being used at the same time, so identifying the opposite structure is relevant to account for that error of not using that prevented function"
        - relatedly, identifying how relevant variables which are alternates to 'position' such as 'speed/energy' can be changed like 'where the structures of sequences are already identified, which makes speeding easier to plan ahead for downward slopes, or makes it more possible to apply successfully' is useful, such as how 'increasing speed' is a general problem-solving intent
        - identify how 'one value change can be important' or where a 'problem can be reduced to one value (like a slope/ratio)', since specific slopes can represent a high degree of information (as connectible to other problem-solving structures like by 'encoding a comparison between start/end points encoding some output metric using the same variable set')
        - relatedly, identifying 'which values are relevant on a standard' and 'patterns/variables/structures of these values' like the 'degree/combination/structure of specificity/variation required to identify relevant values on a given standard' is useful as a general problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, some problems are high variation enough that some subset of the problem will likely be resolvable with a simple structure (in a complex problem, some subset of the problem is likely to be solvable with a ratio/slope), which indicates that 'connections between simple/complex structures' are likely to be usable as default interface queries and identifying the 'structure like a graph in which a simple solution structure is findable' is the more relevant and higher variation problem to solve as well as identifying the other variants of this vertex (there is likely to be a relevant type in a complex problem, a relevant variation source to identify, a relevant missing interim link to connect, etc)

    - identify useful structures like interface structure 'mappings/indexes/connections' that are useful for multiple problem-solving intents through fulfilling some function like 'connect' or some variable like 'generality' or usefulness for general functions like 'standardization/differentiation'
        - for example, non-adjacent changes like 'filters' are applicable as 'differences' and adjacent changes like 'formatting/mapping' are applicable as adjacent 'equivalences/similarities', which are useful to identify and apply as 'similarity/difference' structures in queries formatted as 'similarity/difference' queries, where connecting 'similarities/differences' to standards/symmetries/limits are similarly valuable ('mapping' a set to another set 'standardizes and similarizes' the set, so that other functions like 'compare' are more trivial, where its possible to standardize the set in other standards to make other functions trivial), so 'formatting/filtering' sequences/sets are likely to be useful like other variants of 'similarity/difference' structures like 'generate/filter' are useful
        - relatedly, identifying alternative functions/variables/structures other than 'generalizability' (which fulfills multi-functionality by applying an average/abstract similarity) like by 'applying/implementing similarities' such as 'connecting high variation structures' (which are connectible in multiple ways bc of their high variation), 'commonness' (being likely to interact with more structures and therefore already have multi-functionality), 'patterns' (an alternate to or specific variant of generalization), and 'reversibility' (which fulfills two functions at once, the 'forward/backward functions') and 'multi-variable connections' (to connect multiple similarities with structures like 'intersections' and 'ranges', each similarity having multi-functionality built in through its 'reversibility' structures) to fulfill 'multi-functionality' and the reasons/causes of usefulness is useful
        - similarly, identifying 'functions that fulfill multiple valid function sets' is a way to identify generally useful functions if the valid sets are sufficiently different, since 'valid function sets' are the most useful to connect and differentiate connections of with different connection functions (with intra/inter-set connections)
        - the 'connection vs. input/output' vertex is similar to the 'horizontal sequence vs. vertical set' vertex in identifying structures that are similarly useful to determine as their alternative and useful in determining their alternative and useful to apply changes in, which are general/abstract structures like ratios which are useful to specify (what specific connections are useful to identify in these sets, other than identified useful connections like 'maximally different' and 'most similar' and 'intersecting' and 'multi-functional' and 'extreme' connections), so identifying how one variable in these sets can be used to determine other structures is useful, like identifying how 'determining most vertical sets makes determining adjacent sequence steps more trivial'
        - 'connect general-general as in "intra-type" and general-specific as in "intra-spectrum" and general-structure as in "cross-interface" and general-meaning as "intra-interface" and equivalent-equivalent as in "equivalent-alternate" and equivalent-different as in "symmetry" structures' is a useful problem-solving intent identifying 'connections across differences' that are likely to fulfill multiple problem-solving intents through being 'trivially changeable by some variable like scope/scale and being similarly or newly useful'
            - relatedly, identifying 'specific connections that are useful to identify across problems' is useful, like 'iterable units/bases to adjacently cover high variation' such as 'polynomials that adjacently cover most slope types and most slope type sequences (obviously/directly, rather than indirectly, by extrapolating all possible slopes from a wave by applying scaling)', where 'iterable bases' are 'useful to repeat as a starting point across problems'

    - identify useful structures like 'variants of specific problems like comparisons' that overlap with structures like 'definition contradictions' and 'paradoxes' which are likelier to be useful to solve
        - for example, solving the 'compare' problem for 'incomparable' as in 'very difficult/complex cases' makes other comparisons a matter of finding a subset function of the more complex cases, such as how 'comparing similar alternatives is simplified by identifying extremely different structures' (comparing an apple/orange is trivial by comparing them to a very independent object like a computer, which is trivial to compare to apples with an even more independent object like an infinity, since apples are like 'temporary default untranslated offline specific-problem computers' compared to non-converging infinities)
            - given that its possible to identify a concept like comparability/independence/optimality/generalizability to explain most of the variation between simple/complex variants of a problem, and that all of these concepts have likely not been identified, identifying the variables/structures of these variables (like their 'scope/range/position/pattern of coverage', 'adjacent change types', and their 'complementary variables creating more complete coverage' and 'ranges/patterns/averages of overlaps') are useful to identify
            - given that there are variables like 'similarity' which cover this range and that there are sets of variables like 'volatility/generalization' that also cover this range, identifying the connections between these variables and variable sets is useful to identify (where some range-covering sets will be connectible as 'components' of the range-covering variables)
            - the question to answer about this 'uncertainty space' (between extremes like simplicity/complexity and constant/variable and specific/general) is 'how each of these variables interacts with other variables, specifically to create infinite structures', since this space is the highest variation structure and therefore infinities must be connectible to and generatable from it, and these generated infinities from these high variation reality-covering variables are useful for identifying new variables (similar to how 'e' became a new default bc of integrals which were a high variation variable resulting from 'changes applied to original defaults' like 'multiplication/addition', which came from 'changes applied to previous defaults' like 'spectrum graphs'), which its either safe to assume is always possible to identify new variants of, or reality is determined once the optimal interactions of these variables are identified, which is less likely
                - relatedly, identifying related specific variants of these questions is useful, such as 'whether there will always be a new, more complete/optimal implementation of randomness' or 'whether there will always be some new reality-covering variable in between original/random structures' or 'whether there will always be new, more reality-covering variables than randomness' or 'whether there is an absolute limit of implemented randomness that has been identified or is identifiable, given the definition' or 'whether there will always be a new, more complex/high variation definition of randomness to implement' or 'whether there will be a set of concepts that invalidate randomness absolutely, through their adjacent/complete descriptiveness of reality' or 'whether randomness will always exist, bc it will always change faster than any computation methods, as the relative randomness of variables will always be possible by avoiding filtering all alternatives and by applying changes to existing variables to maintain their specific causation of randomness' or 'whether there will always be enough variation in between some original point and randomness to avoid requiring its complete implementation or to require additional variables to completely implement it' and 'whether its possible to identify randomness that cant be organized/described/identified as adjacently connectible to another variable' and "whether there is a concept beyond 'randomness' that should be used as an alternate opposing variable of 'linearity'"
                - relatedly, identifying 'relative volatility' or 'relative randomness' is useful to identify since there is an 'solution structure of volatility (where a function is actually volatile)' and an error variant and the 'relatively volatile' functions are 'incorrectly volatile' as in 'different from volatility', where there are 'realistic ranges' of volatility, 'probable ranges', 'required ranges', etc which are useful to identify, given other variables that are identified like complexity
            - other related questions to 'solving polynomials' include 'format' questions like "whether polynomials should be formatted as related structures (like 'manifolds' or 'vector sequences' or 'symmetries/similarity indexes' or 'parameter structures like points/ranges/areas')" and 'variation' questions like 'whether there is a sufficient ratio of meaningful variation in polynomial uncertainties to justify applying more variation there to reach those variables, or whether the more meaningful variation is in converting/connecting polynomials to other structures like "causal networks" or "structure definition/interaction networks of structures like infinities/frequencies/maps/manifolds/matrixes"', and whether these are 'equivalent variations' of each other (as a 'symmetric alternate vs. embedded variation' set of questions)
        - similarly, solving the 'compare' problem by identifying 'structures like "ratios" of variants/subsets/structures of "definitions/impacts/usages/other structures of meaning"' that constitute 'similarity/equivalence/difference'
        - similarly, identifying 'ratios of difference/similarity to a threshold ratio representing some solution metric' that represents a 'definition contradiction of that solution metric' is useful to identify, like 'what ratio of difference from a threshold of accuracy contradicts accuracy' and similarly, what ratio of problems can be solved by a simple threshold ratio or require additional ratios to solve, like 'embedded ratios' (once an initial threshold ratio is crossed, what ratios apply to filter that subset that is a solution according to the initial solution metric)
        - similarly, identifying the interactions/connections of the independent structures is useful to identify how to convert them into each other, and identify the "first/best first/other variants of a structure that fulfills the other's definition enough to be compared" or "change both structures into an independent/interim structure where they can be more trivially compared" or "compare existing comparable subsets/impacts/meanings of each definition"
        - relatedly, identifying 'meaning of specific values in reduced sets (such as specific values on a common scale like 0 to 100 as common percentages, like 'first/unit/trivial/non-trivial/reduced/some/correlated/average/many/most/approximate/extreme/maximized/guaranteed/every)' is useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying structure interations like how 'negative structures are likely to surround positive structures given that positive structures are more likely to be distributed rather than concentrated', and how the "interface/symmetry of positive/negative spectrum has alternatives to 'neutral' such as interface variables like complexity/abstraction" are useful to identify and there are "likely to be 'alternating sequences' of positive/negative structures", indicating that there is "likely to be some 'degree of repetition' in the most accurate/useful network of interface variables"
        - connecting "structures like "gaps" in concept networks of defined concepts like 'volatility/randomness/complexity'" to "less defined concepts like 'justice'", since in a 'unique (maximally standardized) concept network', there will likely be gaps where there are fewer concepts since some will be iterated in structures like 'grids', and directing defined concepts toward less defined concepts is useful as a 'directed network structure' to apply in neural networks, similar to how 'positive/negative' and 'abstract/specific' can be usefully alternated in a directed sequence in a network, which is possible and useful since these concepts dont exist at every point in the unique network and specific variants of these concepts like randomness have well-defined ranges/limits/positions
            - relatedly, identifying 'unit structures that contain the most concepts' are useful as components of this unique concept network rather than filtering starting from a 'graph of reality-covering variables applied as fields' and standardizing until unique structures remain
            - relatedly, identifying 'infinitely positive as in useful structures' like 'new structures that can be repeated to solve problems or the same sequence on which all solutions can be found once standardized to that sequence format' are useful to identify, similar to how 'identifying extreme errors is useful' bc it contains 'higher ratios of info (like info about ranges/limits as well as correct variants)' and 'identifying inputs to high variation concepts such as "combinations of similarities/differences like iterations/uniqueness"' are useful to identify
        - identifying 'most problem variable connections' reduces the problem space to 'identifying problem variables' or 'identifying problem equivalences', and relatedly identifying alternate 'sequences or sets or sequences of sets' of interface structures like these intents are the useful structure to identify (sequences being horizontal variation and sets being vertical variation, and connecting either variable set (horizontal or vertical) drastically reduces the problem, since the other variable will be more sortable/determinable/organizable once the original is determined, bc determining one of these variables like the equivalent sets drastically filters what sequences of sets are possible)

    - identifying useful structures like the 'interactions across structures of a type or structures based on another similarity' that hasnt been identified/connected yet
        - for example, identifying 'validity violations' is useful, such as how 'validity (similarity to a valid structure or position in a valid area) of a structure is irrelevant, if the structure is useful', and identifying other structures (like limits as in violations/contradictions/opposites) of interactions between other components of meaning (such as truth/relevance/validity) is similarly useful
        - relatedly, identifying structures like variables of meaning like the 'validity/accuracy/relevance' of a 'data set or polynomial' that require another component like another 'data set or function' (such as the original data set or an average or base or limit function) to compare it to is useful to identify as a variable that isnt 'directly or 1-to-1 mappable to a function on its own', but is relevant to 'comparison-formatted problems', which means that there are solution functions that are valid/accurate/relevant/useful and these have structures like 'overlaps' but arent directly mappable to a function since they require a comparison to be applicable, and also there are functions that have these variables in extreme/useful values across problems, which are useful to identify (like how identifying the most relevant function is a matter of identifying the most different or similar function to other functions)
        - relatedly, identifying whether there are 'organized structures like "types" that can connect/describe/generate every independent variable set, other than the identified descriptive/generative variables like "independence" of the variable set, and other than general types like "connection" that can be applicable to every structure, but rather a type that encapsulates a "relevantly reduced" specificity than "every" is useful to identify since a 'type' is useful as a high variation, organized description of a set and the relevance/usefulness comes from the 'specificity of the reduction'
            - relatedly, 'meaningful/relevant reductions/connections/descriptions' and other types of interface functions/structures are useful to identify variables of, like how variants of a function description involve 'counting different components of different similarities' (different frequency as a "similarity to a common value" count, different area as a "similarity to an axis" counts, different average as a "similarity to a similar function" counts, etc)
        - relatedly, connecting these high variation similarities across functions (such as 'volatility') with the comparison functions (like 'validity') as in 'volatile validity' as applicable to the net function resulting from these comparison function resolutions is a possible way to connect volatility/validity despite the requirement of validity to involve a set of functions (apply volatility to the net function of the comparison)
            - relatedly, identifying connections between these (a variable identifying a 'similarity of functions' like validity and a variable identifying a 'difference in adjacent slopes of the same function') and structures of these connections is useful ('volatile validity' having specific structures like 'strict or specific requirements/constants/limits', which if crossed, have an extreme/volatile impact on validity even if the inputs are adjacent)
            - relatedly, identifying variants of interface interactions like interfaces with a 'intersection point/axis/variable/structure in common' to identify 'interfaces that cross incidentally' vs. 'interfaces with relevant axes of similarities in common (like the primary interfaces)' are useful to identify/differentiate similar to how 'limiting vs. embeddable interfaces' are useful to identify

    - identify useful structures like 'similarly valid graphs of the same variables that differ in some meaning metric like position' and 'standards that can vary on some subset while still reflecting relevant differences' which are useful for general problem-solving intents
        - identifying 'graphs built with valid connections that position volatility/complexity/related variables differently in each graph are useful to identify to enable resolving their actual connections more efficiently
            - I thought of this by visualizing volatile functions and non-volatile functions as a useful spectrum to connect extremes/other structures with, and identifyiing that there were likely conceptual variables in between those that hadnt been identified and identified a structure like a graph that could identify those concepts as well as variants of these graphs, since one valid connection doesnt make the graph correct absolutely, as there are subsets of variables that can be valid and create valid connections, but create a false paradox by giving the false appearance of having a contradiction but its only bc these subsets excluded the other variables, and identified the usefulness of these alternate graphs in identifying the actual relevant interactions of these variables (applying volatility in the maximally different graphs where it can create new differences)
            - relatedly, identifying how each concept can create each useful difference is useful to identify, to identify 'definition routes' of these concepts connected to useful differences and also identify 'more generally useful' and other optimal 'definition route graphs'
        - relatedly, 'standards that can vary on some metric like starting position but still reflect relevant differences' are useful to identify since they require fewer constants (like the 'meaning of absolute position or starting position') to be held constant (only requiring that 'change direction/degree' have the same meaning rather than also requiring 'absolute/starting position' retain its meaning)

    - identify useful structures like "connections that are 'at least partially computible or computible for a relevant subset' and 'useful to connect to describe high variation interactions' and otherwise useful to compute" is a general problem-solving intent
        - identifying interface structures (memory, reduction/compression, failing, simulating, etc) that fulfill 'change (as in improve/learn/optimize)' functions is useful to apply as 'variants of error functions' such as 'ways memory structures like indexes can fail and what error functions will look like with this error'
        - relatedly, identifying 'iterated interface contradictions' like 'indirect obvious connections' and 'direct non-obvious connections' (rather than 'expected similarities/differences') is useful to describe the uncertainty space between definitely true/false or simple/random functions and identify other iterated descriptions that cross the space
        - relatedly, identifying the similarities in the definition of interface structures like 'abstractions' (similarities to specific variants, similarities to other structures in general, similarities as in connections to opposing changes) is useful to identify other structures' connections to similarities and the structures of similarities that havent been identified yet
        - generally, identifying how interface structures like 'requirements' can be 'meaningless' (so irrelevant as to not be required or so variable that it may as well not be a requirement which is associated with constants, violating various definitions of requirements) and identifying their 'opposites' to apply as a a vertex or as a 'default problem-solution set' is useful

    - identify useful structures like connections between 'useful "structure interface" structures like "graph variables" and useful "other/cross/interface-interface" structures like vertexes/interfaces' to identify how graphs can optimize for 'number of vertexes/interfaces' (connecting core structures like 'graphs' being useful to connect to interface-interaction structures like vertexes/interfaces/cross-interface structures/interface queries, since the specific interface/interface interface connection is a useful vertex)
        - for example, identifying a 'graph based on one similarity, that has other independent/indirect similarities' is useful to identify, since it provides a useful implementation of a vertex to search for possible useful variants of ('find all the vertexes as in "useful perspective sets" in a graph' or 'find the graphs (or their variables) that implement more vertexes')
            - generally, 'find a useful structure like a map/index/network/graph that implements some useful difference/similarity/other interface structure more than other variants of that type' (like a 'graph with a built-in vertex like "enough variables and enough required constants like constant interactivity" to allow other structures to develop that are expected from that vertex, which could create other vertexes as in "multiple independent similarities to be reflected in the graph"') is useful as a general problem-solving intent
            - similarly, as referenced elsewhere, the opposite intent of 'identifying all the structures implementing some metric set like efficiency/multi-functionality' is similar in connecting concept/structure interfaces
        - relatedly, identifying 'structures of ratios' is useful to identify other useful structures like 'differences requiring that structure in comparisons', like identifying a 'ratio range' adjacently identifies that the difference between 'expected/average/actual functions' have 'ratio ranges' to account for, such as how 'differentiating two functions that are similar above some ratio range may not be useful'
        - similarly, 'identifying new variation' is a matter of identifying new iterations of interface structures and new structures emerging from those iterations, such as new limits/intersections/other interface structures of those iterations (like identifying the unit/set/other useful structure that, when a specific structure like the 'reduce function' is applied, can connect all structures adjacently)
            - this is like identifying the 'limit limit' and the 'intersection limit', etc of a sequence, as every sequence of sufficiently high variation will connect most core interface structures and some iterated/combined/structures of those structures
            - relatedly, identifying a "graph that makes trivial structural variables like 'count/position' extremely meaningful, such as a graph of interface structures or structures of them like graphs of iterations/networks of interface structures" is useful to identify, since this is a non-trivial intent involving interface structures and is therefore likely to be useful, since a 'count' of interface structures is often very useful, as theyre useful in almost any combination, as even a randomly selected pair is likely to be useful as a possible vertex, and similarly, identifying 'ways to make a structure meaningful (as in likelier to be used/useful)' such as by 'iterating changes to it until it overlaps with another structure to increase its interactivity' or 'increasing distribution of useful structures without decreasing potential variation' or 'increasing usefulness of structures like with optimization structures' is similarly useful, so 'increasing the meaning of solutions and decreasing the meaning of problems' is a general problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying how 'realistic structures' are often less optimal so that applying 'what is optimal' as a 'structure like an upper limit to avoid' is useful to 'identify real structures' bc the 'optimal/real structure set' is a useful vertex to apply, identifying a useful 'upper limit of the range on optimality, to apply changes below' that is useful in identifying real structures
            - relatedly, 'identify (info) and change/improve (info)' are the useful functions being varied between, where these core functions act like 'approximate alternate bases for solution automation workflows' ('identifying the problem/solution/related structures' allows other problem-solving processes and arguably can solve the problem in some cases, just like 'changing a base solution such as improving it' can solve the problem), where other interface sets can act like other vertexes to solve problems to apply variation between just like 'identify real structures/improve real structures into solutions' applies the info/change interface (such as applying the change/change interface 'change by reducing/filtering solutions vs. change by increasing/generating solutions')

    - identify useful structures like 'different variants of relevant identified useful structures' (like describing 'error functions' as a 'useful set of differences to aim for and test for') is useful to identify different variants of 'optimizations' of that structure and structures like 'indexes' to implement those optimizations
        - identifying the reasons why 'identified useful structures might become errors' is useful, such as how an 'loss/error function' is a 'hypothetical structure that isnt guaranteed to be true/real/reflective of reality, in general but also especially in the subset tested by most algorithms' and can easily contain errors like where some variable interaction looks like a 'decrease/increase in that error function but its caused by something else that is indirect or infrequent enough to be irrelevant' or 'an evaluation of the error reflects random noise so the evaluation is inaccurate even if the actual function is useful' or its 'missing relevant subsets that arent identified by some traversal algorithm' or the 'steps in the traversal miss relevant subsets' or the 'error function overlaps with so many irrelevant functions that its meaningless' (the error function captures natural/default variation in random interactions rather than the relevant variable connection) or the 'error function would keep vacillating between two opposing peaks but that vacillation is trivial and irrelevant' or the 'parameters of the network would frequently cause a cycle/wave as in a "return to the same error value" if increased/decreased, making identifying that value trivial/irrelevant and instead identifying the average value, the range of the cycle, and the cycle more relevant'
            - intents like 'predicting the node weight changes that are likely to generate/identify the most relevant changes in error functions (and applying those first)' (differences between maximally different function types/variants) are useful to identify variables/patterns/implementations/structures of and construct networks around filtering these first
            - identifying the function structures corresponding to concepts is useful (to identify 'random' functions by identifying 'repetitions/cycles/waves' or 'data sets reflecting an area but not uniqueness/filters/densities' and identifying 'non-random functions' by 'similarities' or 'low-range waves') to apply to problematic similarities/differences in the neural network problem space like 'error functions' such as to 'filter/predict the error functions', "generate the most useful error functions like 'worst-case scenario error functions' or 'ambiguous as in maximally similar or different error functions' or 'error functions with some variation level or with some specific error structure like a "scale/position" error to test for'", etc
                - this is useful for 'identifying the "randomness/independence/complexity/other high variation metrics" of the data set' and matching it to 'similarly/relevantly random/independent/complex/other metric functions' with the trivial amount of processing required to differentiate the "randomness/independence/complexity/other high variation metrics" point of a function/data set on a "randomness/independence/complexity/other high variation metrics" graph
                - identifying this graph where 'similarly random/independent/complex functions are similarly positioned' and same for all other useful function metrics is not trivial but is likely possible with high variation spectrum variables like interfaces, which is a matter of identifying the combinations/variants of these metrics which are extremely different, mapping those points to some difference structure like a 'volatility structure or a peak', then connecting the other differences once that extreme difference is resolved in that structure
            - the important problem to solve is identifying the 'neural network params, data sets, and actual solution functions' that can produce an error function (whether in some subset/approximate/other structure of the training/traversal of the network, or in its complete/opposite form), given that there are 'equivalent alternates' that overlap in the same error function, so the error function can only indicate so much info and "identifying all the sets that 'overlap at that particular error function point, on a graph of error function'" and "filtering that set mapping to that point" is the useful problem to solve in the AI space, however identifying the error function is still useful bc it identifies the 'reduced set of network params/data sets/solution functions' that are valid, as well as identifying adjacent points of adjacent error functions that are more optimal to aim for and implement with that 'equivalent/similar (as in relevant) data set' (the constant to apply, if there is one)
            - relatedly, identifying interface structures probably/definitively connected by these high variation structures (this 'neural network param' connects a 'subset' of 'adjacent' errors with an 'approximate' solution function) is useful to identify across these 'params/error functions/data sets/solution functions', such as identifying 'possible connections between interface structures' such as identifying that 'iterations created by this network param/function can create this iterated structure like a type/pattern, if this unit structure is what is represented in the data set'
            - relatedly, identifying when workflows shouldnt be applied ('correct constants' shouldnt be applied as the 'solution/base' in the 'change a base solution' workflow, except in edge cases like if all other problems are solved and 'changing constants' becomes useful)
            - relatedly, identifying the opposing errors like identifying how 'standards/similarities offset scale/iteration/repetition' is useful to identify default opposing/solution structures of error structures
            - 'changes in an error function' are caused by 'changes possible in a network, given params, difference-initializing functions, difference-creating functions (change functions like "combine") and difference type created (with that change type like "incremental" change) as well as input/output similarity functions (change-source identification like "PDEs") and difference-identifying functions (evaluating error/loss) and difference-created functions in errors (weight update functions to apply more differences in difference sources/causes or minimize differences elsewhere)' and identifying the 'most optimal change types to test for, like those changes that create maximal relevant differences like "cross-function type" or "cross-function similarity index hub" changes' and identifying what network params like 'nodes of interface networks' create these 'most optimal change types to test for', is a useful index to identify/apply as a default useful network
            - identifying 'functions that cross every similarity index hub' (the 'interfaces or similarity indexes' of similarity indexes) (the common points across the most functions, once standardized) is a useful default function type to apply that is generally useful
        - relatedly, identifying the reason why a useful structure like an 'average/ratio' would be an 'error' structure ('average' is only useful in reflecting the 'most real value of a set' in a 'confirmed similarity set')
        - relatedly, identifying remaining connections/interactions between standard problem-solving structures like ratios/standards/filters (such as that 'standards/interfaces' are the most powerful variable type and they can invalidate filters or other similarly abstract structures)
        - relatedly, as mentioned elsewhere, sequences of 'compare/filter' as useful to identify variants of like 'standardize/filter' or 'sort/filter'
        - given that the 'reason for a data set subset' is useful to remove it from the set to only identify 'connections between unexplained subsets', identifying the 'reason why' any structure like 'randomness' or 'independence' would change a function is useful to remove the most subsets (given that every structure could change a function, identifying how the most high variation or complex or abstract structures would change a subset and how these changes interact is useful to pre-compute before filtering to check for a new function in the remaining sets)
            - identifying the 'reason why any structure like equidistance or hidden info would look like another structure like randomness' is useful to "identify alternate functions as 'irreducible ambiguous function sets'"

    - identify useful structures useful 'standardizing' structures like 'ratios' which havent been applied to connect various structures like 'extreme differences between high variation variables like interface structures or network variables' that form problems yet
        - for example, given that 'ratios' are useful problem-solving structures when the problem can be converted/reduced to a 'compare and select' problem (involving identifying a solution metric and identifying a structure that fulfills it), identifying useful ratios between interface structures is useful to identify optimizations of those ratios and optimal structures fulfilling those ratios in those high variation comparisons, which are a useful default set of solutions to the 'ratio' solution format to compute
        - similarly, applying useful intents like 'identifying the worst case scenario' to a problem like 'neural network optimization' involves identifying 'non-adjacent variants of existing variables/structures of neural networks' like a 'non-trivial subset network interaction that looks like some other phenomenon but is subtly different and also extremely important to identify' and identifying some other structure like a 'parameter threshold or function selection' that is 'very different/distant/independent but is related in an important way' for 'some case that is likely to happen but is not known', where identifying this problem of the worst case scenario and how it could be solved by a ratio (identify the 'structures' that, when iterated in 'some ratio relative to other similar/related structures, such as a "regularly applied type of transform on node layer outputs"', correct the problem created by the 'incorrect parameter threshold/function selection, given that non-adjacent variant of a subset interaction') or other related problem-solving structure like a 'solution range' or a 'high variation variable limit' is useful to identify by applying maximal differences to high variation variables (creating those differences/distances/indirectness/independence/large solution sets that become problematic in the worst case scenario)
        - relatedly, 'worst case scenario' thinking or 'anxiety' (or the opposite) isnt actual thinking bc its dependent on the over-simplicity of one variable/structure which is 'extreme negative differences' as it has an obvious blind spot of the opposite error, which is adjacent (and therefore more relevant in many cases) errors, where multiple variants of these one-variable over-simplifications are often required to offset each other's errors (mixing 'anxiety with risk-taking' or mixing 'optimism with conservative risk evaluation functions')
        - relatedly, identifying how 'extreme differences in parameters of a function' can change its functionality is useful to identify as a type of 'difference (inputs/parameters and resulting functionality/outputs) in a similarity (same function)', like identifying whether a obfuscation function can still be called that with some extreme parameter difference, to the extent that the function loses its identity and the 'function structure doesnt matter' bc the parameters can change enough to act like an 'overriding/invalidating interface'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'position/frequency/variants/combined/interface/other structures of meaning' of interface structures (like how 'names' often reflect 'arbitrary/random' differences and often reflect 'local/relative/specific rather than absolute/abstract' differences/uniqueness)
            - relatedly, identifying 'absolute meaning' as in 'structures whose meaning is constant' is a matter of identifying the 'primary abstract interfaces', which is useful to identify, as 'structures that can change more' are more useful to connect, to other variables and to each other, as this will be the structure set that its 'useful to solve for every comparison in the set', as interface contain the most possible variation even while having the same absolute meaning, since there are possible interactions of interfaces that violate their meanings, such as iterations of some interface structure like the interface network that invalidates its meaning (such as a grid of specific interface networks that is so similar in some metric to other iterations/structures of different interface networks that its too common to be meaningful), so its useful to compute the meanings of the interface network as a set of high variation variables that is more useful to connect than any other set, while identifying these possible invalidating iterations of its seemingly absolute meaning, as 'meaning difference resolutions' are a useful format of problem-solving structures
        - relatedly, the 'abstraction-specification combination' of a 'function network with filtering functions with some "uncertainty level" that determine sequence limits and change functions determining sequences "within a scalar limit"' is useful to identify as a 'starting solution to apply specifications to' which reduces the problem of optimizing neural networks to iterating a reduced list (reduced lists of 'filtering functions with variation/uncertainty' and 'change sequences of scalars') which are automatable once identified bc of the reduction applied by the 'types/variables' of those lists, so identifying other 'spectrum-differences of maximally different variables like uncertainty of cross-function types/other cross-iterated interface structures' is useful to iterate as a default set of 'difference-connecting structures' and therefore problem-solving structures (similarly, 'sequences of non-invalidating functions' is another example to usefully specify by iterating)

    - identify useful structures like 'differences in meanings in a meaning network' that can solve most problems of differentiating/connecting/reducing structures, since 'meaning' provides an approximation of a structure which makes it more useful to compute and apply than the structure it represents, where the 'structures that mean these meanings' (a reduced set) are trivial to identify/iterate, so 'finding the right connections in meaning' first is the more useful problem to solve first
        - for example, 'identifying all the possible differences in meaning (as in inputs like relevant useful structures to use, and outputs like relevant usages applied/emerging)' is an alternate general problem-solving intent
        - the 'infinite errors' are the most useful to identify (such as 'violations of meaning used to find meaning, as in 'crimes committed to get solutions'), to 'connect meaning differences' to create interface queries
        - identifying a 'network of meanings' to identify 'possible meanings of a set of structures' is useful like identifying that some structure like a 'triangle' compared to a function has 'simplicity area under a curve/sloped line' meaning, but in comparison to a square, has 'partial/subset/diagonal' meaning, and some other structure set might represent 'complete irrelevance' like some non-interactive molecule and a computer ('complete irrelevance' as in where its nontrivial to convert it into a meaningful structure like a neutrino and a computer)
        - identifying these default defined meanings and sorting/filtering by infinite meanings like infinite errors first is useful to identify (like where the network is sorted to apply infinite meanings first in every possible connection), where differences in sorts/filters and meaning types of a meaning network would be useful to identify new variation in meaning, which is useful as a 'default network to apply queries on'
        - relatedly, identifying intents like 'limit requirements' as 'requiring specificity (meaning additional filters) in its implementation bc it allows extreme variation', such as how there is a useful ('solving all problems', 'avoiding causes of problems or avoiding problems') and useless way ('avoiding solving any problems') to implement that intent, and relatedly its useful to identify intents that are specific enough to prevent useless implementations, and identifying 'optimal implementation variables/patterns of these general intents' is similarly useful, and identifying structures like 'ranges to stay within to avoid changing these optimal implementations variables/patterns/examples too much' is similarly useful (as in connecting these abstractions to interfaces like problems/solutions or similarities/differences to make them more useful)
        - relatedly, identifying the 'abstraction/specification' at which point some connection becomes too abstract (sufficient to 'allow the opposite of that connection to be equally valid') is useful as an example filter that allows using 'any connection set that can be abstracted' as a way to identify 'limits on abstraction, at which usefulness decreases bc opposites are both valid at that point' (as in, start abstracting connections to identify their limits of validity/volatility/other useful variables, to create a default network to apply to filter connections), which is useful bc a connection can be verified by whether its 'below a level of abstraction where its opposite would be allowed and above a level where its relevant/meaningful/useful equivalents/similars are not allowed', and where the continued validity of a connection across these limits (where its opposite is never equally true) is useful to identify 'generally true' as in 'abstract connections'
        - relatedly, identifying obvious structures is a matter of identifying pure/simple iterations/patterns/units that can be repeated to create a similarity/difference
        - relatedly, identifying overlaps in abstract structure connections like overlaps in constant/simple as opposed to overlaps in variable/complex is useful to identify, to identify the limits of these areas and the limits/requirements of other areas

    - identify useful structures like 'useful reduced sets/lists' that can be iterated quickly in a useful way, which reduce the work of interface queries, and identify related useful intents like 'identify ways to integrate those useful reduced sets into interface queries', which applies these 'useful reduced sets' as an interface to apply changes around
        - for example, similar to how there are 'similarity' structures (like validities, connections, averages) and 'difference' structures (like opposites, extremes, volatilities), and a way to format any problem as a set of similarities/differences to resolve, the set of similarity structures provides a default set of structures to apply in the position of the requirement for the similarity
            - similarly, identifying whether one structure (like an 'abstract interface structure') or multiple structures (like vertexes/cross-interface structures/queries) is required/probably useful in a similarity/difference position is useful to filter the list of interface structures to apply in that position, similar to how 'knowing if a subset or complete set is more useful' is a way to apply subset structures or complete structures, and same for other variables of interface structures
            - identifying the 'most useful sequences of these filters (like count/subset) of interface structures, once an interface like similarity/difference has been applied' as an 'interface query to select interface queries' is useful to identify
            - this changes the problem of 'filter interface queries' to 'select an item (like a similarity type) from each list of associated structures (like various similarity types), to apply in the position of a required structure (like a required similarity)', given that 'these interface structure lists are identified/identifiable' and identifying which 'list of interface structures to iterate/filter' as a 'list that is required/useful in that position' is trivial, so 'apply a similarity structure in each required similarity position' is the function to identify/apply, and this set of similarities can be filtered further to make each selection of a similarity in the list more useful
            - this is similar to the intent of 'identify a graph to format a problem in', but varies the structure being iterated/varied from 'graph' to 'similarity', which can be another interface structure as well
            - this can be reversed to find the 'most different interface structure set that would be useful for the most intents' like 'find a similarity like a standard to apply, find a difference like an ambiguity to differentiate, find a connection between them' which would cover the most other usefully connected structures, just like the 'most similar interface query to other interface queries on some useful similarity index'
        - relatedly, identifying 'structural solution metrics' like 'higher variation (than existing solutions)' and 'otherwise different from existing solutions' is useful to combine these to generate solutions that are more probably correct ('apply changes to existing solutions' or 'apply changes to connections between existing solutions')
        - relatedly, iterating through a list of similarities/differences between interface structures (like 'difference in implementation/optimal requirements', 'difference in current/optimal position', 'difference in abstraction/optimal specification') is similarly useful as a default set of problems to check for
        - relatedly, identifying the 'ratio of similarity/difference/neutrality' and 'how to change one into the other' is similarly useful as a general problem-solving intent

    - identify useful structures like 'limits on connectibility/reducibility' that are useful for implementing core functions like 'connect/reduce' of workflows
        - for example, identifying the 'limits on the possible connections between items in a set' is useful to identify, since most connections have variants but some structures (like an 'encrypted/original document') can only be linearly or otherwise trivially connected using some specific subset of structures, given the 'specificity involved (in assigning one specific string to the original specific document)' and the 'required uniqueness of the encrypted document' and the 'randomness associated with the encryption process', where there may be some subset of overlaps in this mapping but otherwise very few structures can be used to connect those items
            - similarly, some abstractions cant connect more specific differences bc the abstraction covers too much variation than the specific differences have
        - relatedly, 'infinity' is an interface that emerges on the 'math' interface bc its so 'extreme' that it 'covers reality' (although it differs from other interfaces in that its not exactly an abstract info structure except when its definition component of 'immeasurability' is considered), and similarly interface structures like opposites such as convergent infinities are related to specific abstractions as 'pre-filtered sets' and where infinities are useful as types/patterns/sets that cover reality and therefore can be used to connect different structures adjacently and are related to spectrums in that they allow solution structures like ratios to be used once problem structures are standardized to the infinity/spectrum and 'finding an infinity that is adjacent to most solution structures' is a useful intent
            - identifying other 'immeasurable/irreducible/unconnectible' structures is likely to contain new interfaces
        - relatedly, identifying 'similarity indexes of interfaces' and 'iterations of interface structures like similarity indexes that create errors' are similarly useful structures

    - identify useful structures like 'variants of a definition' that allow new variation such as 'similarity to a rule set' as being similar to 'similar to a similarity index' but different in the 'interface structure combination' equated
        - for example, 'valid' structures (sufficiently similar to a rule set so as to be definitely within the variation allowed by that rule set's definition) and 'equivalent alternate' structures ('similar alternatives' as in 'similar differences') are also 'similarities/symmetries', like many other interface structures, which are useful to identify variants of to identify every type of similarity and its variables to generate all the similarities required to connect differences
            - relatedly, identifying 'equivalent alternates' of 'requirements' is useful to apply as identifying a 'specific similarity type and a relevant abstraction (that is useful to similarize with that similarity)' that is both possible and useful in covering reality, where identifying other variants like 'extensions' of this similarity type applied to similarly abstract structures is likely useful as well
        - relatedly, identifying how problem-solving structures like 'ratios' can be used to fulfill core functions like 'sort' (involving 'sorting algorithms comparing one pair at a time') is useful as well as connecting them to other interface structures like symmetries ('change in a ratio of difference'), and identifying when 'abstractions of ratios' (like general terms like generally making progress in the direction of lesser/greater) are more useful than specific ratios (like values above/below a specific threshold value) is useful to identify as different cases having different requirements
        - identifying the 'structures missing from an interface' like the 'areas not covered by an abstraction' is useful to identify and apply as a set of default 'difference in a similarity' structures intersecting with interfaces (the 'errors like "missing info" as differences from an interface' and the 'opposites allowed in an interface' and other differences relevant to an interface) to connect differences like 'limits/independences' and similarities like 'abstractions/symmetries/ratios' as default 'problem/solution vertexes to connect'
        - similarly, connecting 'difference in a similarity' and 'similarity in a difference' structures to find their 'overlaps/limits' is useful as a default set of problem-solving structures, given that most problems will be solved by some structure that is more complicated than either alternative
        - interfaces (particularly the interface interface) are useful as a simulator of reality in that they allow the most contradictions to co-exist, which is a useful abstraction of reality which incentivizes 'variation/uncertainty increases'
        - similarly, connecting interface structures to associated errors (like how some abstractions as in 'lack of specific info about some connection/similarity' are 'missing info errors' and some abstractions are useful at describing a high ratio of variation) is useful as a general problem-solving intent

    - identifying useful structures like 'input interface variables (equivalent alternates of powerful variables like limits of powerful variables) of interface variables (like remove/reduce) of other interface variables (powerful variables)' where they exist, which sometimes is another interface structure (a 'changer' of a 'limit' can determine a 'ratio'), similar to how 'applying changes to an interface structure until another one is identified' can fulfill problem-solving intents like 'connect interface structures'
        - for example, identifying 'limit-removing' variables is useful bc they indirectly change 'ratios' which are frequently the determining/powerful variables of a problem, which generally identifies the 'variables that change powerful variables', as 'removing limits on a variable' can make that variable a powerful variable, and 'indirect connections' are valuable to identify where they exist, as these independent/indirect variables that can change each other in some cases can act like 'vertexes' and 'indirect connections' are less likely to exist than direct connections
        - 'maximally-different multi-functionality' as 'covering different interface structure variables' and being 'likelier to have other functionality as a result of the independent variables connected' is useful to identify as a useful iterated interface structure as a 'variable-enhancing variable'
        - connecting interface structures to problem/solution structures is a useful set of default queries (all the ways limits can cause problems/solutions, etc), where 'abstract systems' that generalize some type of system ('worst case systems', 'efficient/cyclical systems', 'interface systems') are useful to identify abstract info structures to solve problems in these abstract systems (all the ways limits can cause problems/solutions in abstract systems, etc), similar to how its useful to identify how 'limits can cause problems/solutions' in formats/interfaces
            - this is why interface structures (root variables, bases, vertexes, etc) as the best 'simulator of reality', 'simulators' being similarly useful as 'tests/filters'

    - identify useful structures like 'overlapping metric structures like metric ranges/types' between interface metrics like 'reason-backed functions' and 'relevant functions' and 'maximally different functions' and 'average functions' which create 'interface-similarity indexes' to identify 'interface-different functions' as well as 'connections between interface structures of differences/errors and useful functions like reduce/connect'
        - for example, the combination of errors as in a 'lower/upper limit on error' is useful to identify another useful structure as in a 'range of error', and similarly, other structures of errors can create other solution metrics, if the errors create a 'reduced/connected/otherwise useful structure'
        - similarly, the 'range in a value error' is similar in usefulness to the 'range in a complexity error' and a 'range in a meaning error' (there is a 'complexity range' and a 'meaning range' to optimize for, as well as other ranges of interface structures like similarity/maximal differences and other structures like 'meaning values like thresholds/ratios/positions/points'), similar to how there are 'real ranges of complexity (as in the "most complex identified irreducible structure")' and 'probability ranges of complexity' that overlap with other 'ranges of interface structures'
            - relatedly, identifying structures like 'limits' of interface structures like 'irreducible complexity' or 'optimizable complexity' that is related to core interaction functions like reduce/connect or other function sets like 'optimize' are useful to identify and apply to connect these function sets (connect 'reduce/connect' and 'optimize' using complexity)
            - relatedly, identifying 'connections between solution structures' such as how a 'solution/optimality "range" is equal to a usable error "ratio"' is useful to 'reduce uncertainty' in the problem of 'filtering interface queries', so that once a 'solution range' is identified, a 'usable error ratio' is also identified, and identifying other ways these structures interact (ranges can be represented as ratios)
            - relatedly, different solution structures like 'solution ranges' or 'peaks/points of optimality in an area' identifies 'different assumed patterns of solutions' (one assuming that a small continuous area contains all the solutions, the other assuming that solutions are not adjacent or are rarely adjacent) and identifying other solution structures can be done by identifying other 'patterns of solutions'
        - relatedly, identifying the connections between core functions like 'reduce/connect' and general problem-solving intents like 'optimize' are useful to identify, such as how 'changing by reducing some metric' will 'optimize' for that metric, which creates a problem of 'identifying metrics to reduce' in order to implement an 'optimize' function by 'reduction' (and implementing an 'optimize' function by 'connection', and an 'organize' function by 'matching/sorting', etc, since there are functions more similar across function sets which should be applied as a base for implementing those similar functions in another set)

    - identifying useful structures like general connections between specific interface structures like 'remove limits requiring filters, by identifying alternatives to limited structures' to identify useful problem-solving intents to avoid another workflow ('compare, and filter')
        - identifying alternate intents ('allowing investing in multiple alternatives, to avoid choosing/filtering') to invalidate some intent sequence ('compare, to choose/filter an option from a set') is useful to apply to identified sequences/structures of intents like workflows/queries ('the more alternatives can be supported, the fewer choices need to be made') like where some problem has been invalidated ('organ function is not a problem bc machines replace the organs, essentially removing the limit on organ function') so fewer choices need to be made (more treatments can be tried at once), which involves general intents like 'remove limits requiring filters, by identifying alternatives to limited structures'
        - relatedly, identifying probable moves ('moves that are so different in some metric that they are named since names are relied on, where the name indicates some often arbitrary similarity to familiar structures, bc memory favors indexes like specific named moves, and these moves overlap with some interface structure like game-ending moves') by identifying memory mechanisms (prioritizing for familiarity/maximal differences/specifications and having limits favoring small indexes and having alternatives like 'generating optimal moves from states' and opposite cases like 'best/worst cases' like 'memorizing consensus/identified-optimal moves in most states, given some consensus mechanism' and favoring extreme filters of moves to extremely reduce the solution space) is useful for specific 'consciousness levels' and alternatives like 'iteration/interaction/variation levels' 
            - relatedly, identifying 'structures to identify when there is likely another useful structure like a move in a space' is useful (identifying remaining variation vs. identifying variation of useful structures, such as identifying remaining adjacent formats/concepts not connected to the space yet and identifying formats/concepts as sufficiently high variation and adjacent to be useful structures to connect)
            - the value of a move is related to its surprise/difference which means 'identifying maximally different moves, given a sequence' is useful to identify the most optimal moves, given the 'previous sequence indicating concepts' that will be useful in identifying 'opposing concepts' to generate surprising/different moves
        - relatedly, identifying useful metrics can be done by identifying structures like units/high variation concepts/proxies/variables/similarities/specifications/examples/definitions, so identifying possible solutions is a matter of 'identifying these possible metric structures' and 'identifying graphs where some subset is adjacent/otherwise useful' and 'identifying adjacent/otherwise useful routes to a subset of the metrics'
            - relatedly, identifying structures like 'metrics' that are only similar to a subset of interface structures (like concepts/variables/specifications) is useful, since its opposites (problems of comparison and problems of identifying what to compare) can likely be trivialized by the opposites of those interface structures (uncertainties/ambiguities/sets/generalizations/disorganizations/requirements) which are nearer to problems more often than solutions, and identifying these connections is useful as a default problem-solving index/network
        - specific error structures like 'overwhelmed structures' like 'over-stressed systems/functions/bases' reflecting 'sub-optimal but probable/adjacent errors, in a system where balance is essential for functioning' and opposing errors like 'under-used systems, leading to disorganization from lack of use' and like 'incorrect structures to compare' of intents like 'compare, to filter' are useful to identify ('what are the error structures of each intent/structure' being a useful problem-solving intent)
            - identifying other differences than 'opposite' like 'average', 'adjacent but different', 'different but relevant', and other useful structures for different intents are useful to index (opposites are useful for identifying extremes to oscillate between or similarize, averages/parallels/similarities are useful for identifying differences/orthogonalities), such as to identify the 'average of a set of structures' which is likely to be useful in connecting the extreme opposites)
            - relatedly, specifying a 'unit of a problem' as a 'trivial iterable combination of problem variables' is useful to identify other structures like 'variables that havent caused a problem yet' like 'new variable combinations or new iterations of existing variables' as a 'new source of variation in "error"', where 'identifying new sources of variation in "specific interface structures" (like by applying new variables and new variable sources to all interface structures)' is generally useful as a problem-solving structure
        - relatedly, identifying a map of error structures like 'invalidation structures' within a 'definition set created by applying interface structures' to identify inputs/limits/structures of error structures like 'extremes in interface structure variables like position/size' is useful to identify 'common variables of valid/optimal/error structures in a definition', as many problems involve 'identifying different variants of a definition' (applying the definition as a core similarity to base/connect changes on)
            - for example, the intent of 'minding your own business' to fulfill intents like 'decency' has an error (as in "when is the worst case to apply the intent 'mind your own business'", such as 'when a victim is calling for help', which violates the relevant intent of 'positivity/decency' despite definitely 'minding your own business')
            - as mentioned elsewhere, this is similar to how 'this statement is false' can be true ("the statement" 'this statement is false' is "true" bc 'the statement' and 'this statement' are different references, which leads to a false similarity where it appears they are referencing the same statement, but one is referencing itself and one is referencing another statement)
                 - arguably, 'this statement' and 'any true statements about this statement' need to be connected using valid/true connections, so any 'interpretation or emergent meanings' of the statement needs to reflect the statement, but this isnt absolute/required
                 - given that there are valid arguments for either side, this can qualify as a paradox, an error of false similarity, or a lack of information/definition indicating the resolution (true/false isnt specific enough to describe this case, 'similarly true and false' being an alternative better description)
                 - given that 'falsehood' indicates the opposite ('this statement' must be true if its not false) when 'false' is interpreted as referencing the 'emergent meaning of the statement (as in the connection between statement/false)' (the "connection between statement/false" is false, meaning "statement/true" is the true connection), 'specifications' need to be applied as to what 'false' refers to and what 'the statement' refers to before this can be resolved (the definitions are incompletely specific, meaning the emergent error is a 'false ambiguity' created by 'incompletely specific definitions', an incompleteness that may be useful enough to avoid specification just to avoid this statement's ambiguity)
            - relatedly, given that there are 'frames of reference' or 'embeddings in systems' that change meaning as in 'relative position', connections in these 'meaning-changing networks of references/embeddings/perspectives' are usable as interface queries (as in 'useful differences to solve problems by applying different structures to connect differences'), and similarly, 'changes that dont change meaning' are useful to identify structures like 'limits' of 'similarities' (like applying changes within the same definition to identify its limits) to solve problems by 'connecting different structures by similarities'

    - identifying structures like 'definitions/connections/directions/positions' that havent been optimally used yet is useful to identify, like 'connecting interface-variants of combinations of solution metrics, starting with the definition of combinations of solution metrics'
        - for example, 'identifying solution metrics' is useful for other intents like 'identify interface structures like combinations of solution metrics' and 'identify the limits/areas/centers of the combinations of solution metrics' which is useful as a general problem-solving intent, bc identifying ways to change the solution metric combinations so that they still fulfill the metric definitions is useful to identify solution structures like solution areas (find all the ways solution metric combinations like 'efficiency/multi-functionality' can be 'changed' and 'changed into structures' so that the structures still 'fulfill the definitions of efficiency/multi-functionality' to identify an 'area or other similarity like a pattern' of 'efficiency/multi-functionality' by changing the definition of 'efficiency/multi-functionality' up to its limits, which is like stretching definitions to find paradoxes/contradictions), which is like reverse-engineering all the structures that are optimal by 'identifying all the structures that useful structures like optimizations/solution metrics can have' in the abstract and in general and in specific systems
            - relatedly, connecting these abstract 'variants of solution metric combinations' with specific variants and similarly connecting other spectrum/high variation/interface variable 'variants of solution metric combinations' is similarly useful
        - relatedly, 'identifying common variables of optimization/solution metrics' allows identifying 'areas/points/ranges/structures of overlaps' across solution metrics which is a useful problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, connecting 'networks of solution metric structures' or connecting 'solution networks with problem networks' can be done in various ways bc of the network structure they have in common (rotating networks or changing position or extending their definitions to create intersections/overlaps)
        - identifying useful connection structures in between 'abstract solution metric combinations' and 'specific solution metric combinations' like 'similarities/differences' ('similarities/differences' are so relevant/useful/standard that they are useful to connect these 'abstract solution metric definitions' with 'specific structures resolving each similarity/difference structure') 
            - meaning one of the best ways to specify abstractions is by connecting them to similarity/difference structures or error structures (which are relevant to problems), which means it can be used to identify which specific structures like specific maps/networks/indexes are useful
            - this means identifying all the ways 'efficiency/multi-functionality' can be used to resolve an 'ambiguous similarity in different structures' or a 'ambiguous limit of a difference in a similarity', and converting a new problem to similarity/difference structures to identify 'efficiency/multi-functionality' structures (solutions) that can be used for that problem's similarity/difference structure (applying the intent of 'standardizing all interface structures to all other interfaces')
            - identifying all the interface structures like 'problems/solutions' or 'similarities/differences' in a 'combination of solution metrics' is useful in general and will likely also be useful for 'specifying the abstract metrics'

    - identify useful structures like 'incompletely implemented intents' that are likely to be useful, beyond structures that are defined to be useful or required or otherwise guaranteed to be useful
        - for example, identifying 'missing info' in the 'set of differences in similarities' is a useful intent applying an error structure to an interface structure, an intent that is incomplete, so is useful to identify
            - similarly, identifying other useful structures like 'solutions to errors of structures of interface structures' is useful as a default set of intents that will likely solve other problems once complete
            - this is identified by identifying how many abstract info structures are 'similarities in differences (or the opposite)' (like how abstractions/types/maps/efficiencies/optimizations/requirements are all different types of differences in a similarity) and identifying a graph of these useful structures as having missing variants and identifying the likelihood of other useful incomplete intents that would be generally useful across problems (identifying all the abstract info structures that are a 'similarity in a difference' and identifying relevant structures like the variables of these would likely cover a high ratio of problems) and the relevance of completeness of an implementation
        - identifying 'completeness' of an implementation is a matter of identifying 'useful approximate completeness' of an implementation and 'useful interim approximate completeness' and 'useful alternate approximate completeness'
        - relatedly, the set of interface structure connections has a 'maximum useful integration potential' that isnt reached which is useful to identify (there is a way to connect every interface structure in every way, but the 'maximum useful integration potential' is likely less than that set of complete connections, so 'combining interface structures in every way' isnt likely to be useful except as a set of default connections, and the 'most integrated connections of the most variation' are likelier to be a useful subset)
        - similarly, the 'variants of an implementation' that 'only uses high variation variables' or 'which identifies components that can be recombined to generate other useful implementations' are useful to identify and apply as problem-solving intents (integrating intents into interface queries to solve future problems) and 'connecting these variants of implementations in a network' is a useful intent
            - these 'implementation variant networks' (connecting implementation variants like the 'most complete simple implementation', meaning implementations of specific intent sets, like 'generally useful intents') are useful to connect to 'solution metric networks' and the 'solution variant networks' and 'optimization networks' and 'error networks', as implementations will inevitably overlap with solutions/errors/optimizations/variables of these structures/interface structure networks, and there might be useful symmetries/variables identified in these connections
        - relatedly, 'identifying variables' usually is useful before/after 'identifying network of variants', so identifying these 'useful structures like "alternate sequences/adjacencies of intents", given probabilities of usefulness' is useful to identify probable/default components of interface structures (these two intents arent just useful in a sequence, theyre useful in any adjacency to each other)

    - identifying useful insights to apply in a problem space by identifying sub-problems (like 'identifying what is an input to reality (components/cause/probability)' as a useful intent in the 'describe superpositions' problem space to identify related insights to that intent as a useful intent-insight index to apply)
        - for example, identifying that 'if you can measure/interact with it, it can be real' and 'components/inputs/outputs/variants/symmetries/probabilities/adjacencies of all possibilities are real' and 'metrics cant always capture all relevant variation' and 'metrics can change information' and 'information changes (or is changed) once its known/seen' and 'identifying a symmetry uniting variables like speed/position is probably possible/valid/useful' and 'identifying different alternatives like alternative requirements is a way to avoid suboptimal metrics like metrics that change info by identifying new relevant variables like new symmetries and changing direction toward other filters/metrics' (as in 'rather than measuring something, give it more functionality until the original problem is solved') are relevant to quantum physics structures like 'entanglement/superpositions' is useful to identify alternate representations of their interactions, given that sequences arent quite sufficient as a representation
            - for example, the 'multi-directional cause' of 'metrics that change measured values such as by over-standardizing/simplifying values' is a 'combination of a normal causal sequence (measure a value that is observed to have occurred in the past) and a reverse causal sequence (change a past value when measuring it)' where the measurement acts like an attractor of truth thereby 'making any adjacencies to truth that fit in the measurement true', and where measuring it leads to future changes applied to that value, either directly during measurement or bc truths are frequently relied on and changed by default, where these sequential interactions are better represented as networks/loops
        - these insights identify related structures like 'overlaps/connections/symmetries (like manifolds) between alternate possibilities (as in "alternate speed/position similarity/connection networks/states") or related variables (a symmetry in speed/position as in "causes of position and position changes, like speed")' where these structures are allowed in the superposition by its definition are useful structures to identify as possible and identify filters of
        - similarly, answering questions like 'what needs to be the "free/variable" form of possible, for reality to be the "real/certain" form of possible' is relevant to solve the problem of 'what can be unmeasured/variable, without destabilizing reality', since when some variable is measured, it is changed or starts changing, and 'temporarily freezing everything in reality by measuring as much of it as possible and using those measurements' might prevent variation from existing outside the constant/frozen area and the measurement device, so 'synchronizing measurements with requirements/constants/truths' is useful to avoid 'disorganized/overlapping loops of measurement/variation that dont synchronize measurements with constants/truths' that invalidate each other
            - similarly, 'identifying the correct loops of measurements/filters, and the synchronizations of measurements with constants, and their connective network to avoid these errors' is a useful problem-solving intent
            - relatedly, identifying 'variables that cant be constant (like random variables or infinite energy sources)' are useful to identify as 'limits of constants' and 'invalidators of truths'

    - identify useful structures like functions to identify value spectrums that can be used to fulfill generally useful intents like 'rank/prioritize/sort intents'
        - for example, identifying 'value spectrum variables' as relevant is useful to identify related intents like 'identify resolutions or switching functions between similar relevant high-value intents/functions' ('high-value intents' like 'identify a new network' or 'change position/similarity definition of an existing network' which are similar/relevant and likely to be alternatives), to identify similarly valuable structures on the 'intent value spectrum', as identifying more valuable intents to solve for by identifying the value spectrum and the 'function to determine comparative value of an intent (like by identifying the degree of variability resolved by the intent)' can direct other interface queries toward these higher value intents (similar to how general intents are more valuable)
        - similarly, 'predicting future high-value intents' and 'identifying low-value intents in contradiction to this insight (like intents that are "required but otherwise trivial or irrelevant", or intents that are "specifically useful but not adjacently generalizable")'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'required generalizability' and other applications of interface structures is useful to identify the network of interface interactions (as well as their optimal interactions, requirements of their interactions, limits/ranges of their interactions, etc based on that network)
        - similarly, identifying the index of 'intents that are optimal, once other intents are completed' is useful to apply the vertex of 'function usage optimality, once some subset of functions is usable by being complete/identified'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'cost to change an error into a solution' is useful to identify before identifying whether some structure is an error/solution (if it turns out to be an error, how much approximately would it cost to change into a solution, meaning how useful/true/otherwise relevant is it?)
        - similarly, "identifying useful structures like 'change size/position' and how it can be useful and the contexts where its useful" is an index that reduces the problem of 'identifying interface queries' to 'identifying the context'

    - identifying useful structures like 'problem stability' and 'problem/solution stability ratio' and identify related useful problem-solving structures (like ratios and intents and equivalent alternates)
        - for example, identifying that the 'lack of fragility' is frequently a problem in 'hard-coded (over-constant or over-stable) processes, where 'flexibility' is more useful than 'stability', identifies that the 'stability' of errors is frequently a problem, so that 'reducing the stability of a problem or its causes' is a way to solve problems (a 'greater ratio of stability' in errors as opposed to solutions is frequently a problem)
            - for example, 'hard-coding growth' is a problem leading to other problems of 'over-stable growth' (such as in 'cancer') as opposed to its opposite function error ('over-stable regulation' such as 'autoimmune conditions') and as opposed to its solution opposite 'hard-coding balance between opposing forces and other optimalities like balance of interactions between variables of opposing forces'
            - the 'over-stability' of a constant leads to other 'over-stability' errors, such as 'over-stable errors (compared to stability of solutions)'
        - this identifies 'stability of a problem' as a useful variable to identify other problem-solving intents like 'identify constants and check if they are problems, given how frequently "over-stability/inflexibility/constance of an error" or the "comparatively high ratio of stable errors compared to stable solutions" is a problem'
        - this is similar to how falsehoods are more common than truths and problems are more common than solutions, so using 'commonness' as a variable of problems/solutions is useful to identify other useful structures (identify all the problems or their generative variables and whatever is left is likely useful/optimal in some way or identify solutions since theyre rarer)

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between useful function sets (such as a function that can be an item in either set)' is useful as a new generally useful problem-solving intent
        - for example, identifying a function that can easily become complex/simple is useful to identify functions that are likely to be useful for solving most problems, given that 'mixed-complexity structures' and other interface structures of interface structures are likely to be useful in algorithms, given that problems often have a simple/complex variant, so simple/complex functions are required to solve those, and applying an optimization like 'multi-functionality' to 'a set of functions including both simple and complex function subsets' by 'merging the functions into one function' is useful, given that its possible
        - identifying optimization opportunities like variables like 'possible usages of error while fulfilling other intents' (determining what should be stored about errors while determining the original intent)

    - identify useful connections like between intents/workflows/descriptions of problem-solving variables and sources of variation (connections between 'different differences in variables identified')
        - solving the 'interface identification' problem as solving a problem of 'identifying a useful base' as in 'parameterization' which is connected to a default workflow 'change a base solution (or change a base problem/error)', where other problem-solving workflows/intents like 'reduce the problem' or 'connect problem/solution' or 'identify new variables' can be connected to the definition in other ways (as a 'powerful variable identification' problem, or a 'connect all independent variables' problem, or a 'variation position identification' problem)
            - for example, '"apply optimizations of another solution" to make that likelier to solve other problems by making other optimal structures generally useful' is a difference applied in the "problem solved by a workflow" bc that is a useful 'base for change' (source of variation)
            - similarly, 'change solutions to avoid other structures of errors' as an alternative to 'avoiding error inputs' like 'avoiding other error interface structures like error requirements, common implementations of error functions, error outputs, etc' is a difference applied in the 'error structure avoided/optimized for by a solution or solution-finding method' bc that is a useful 'base for change'
            - similarly, 'identifying changes of limits' is useful as a general problem-solving intent, bc when limits change, it is useful to identify that before encountering the side effects like errors of that change as limits are powerful predictors
            - similarly, 'identifying abstractions or adjacent variables that are highly descriptive of some complex variable' is another useful intent related to 'changing the base' as the 'abstraction' functions like a base, and relatedly, 'changing the base abstraction' identifies related problem-solving intents, like 'identify the variables that connect high variation variables bc the interim variable has variation that is in between the other variables (causally or otherwise), or bc the variable contains all the variation and more of the connection so it is adjacent by encapsulating the whole connection or it approximately encapsulates the connection by connecting slightly different endpoints (in a different position, like surrounding rather than between)'
            - connecting these intents to workflows is useful to identify a 'default index of intents implementing a workflow' to filter interface queries
        - relatedly, identifying the 'intents that are frequently useful' (like identify the 'high variation' variables, identifying the 'high variation variables that connect high variation input/output variables', identifying the "equal and unequal-variation containing" variables, identifying the 'n-variable reduction/filter') is useful to identify intents that should be prioritized as having 'different differences in the variables identified' and identifying their optimal routes/weights/other variables of their connections
        - relatedly, in addition to identifying 'cancer growth at night' and 'other variables that increase/reduce at night' to identify 'cortisol at night' as a possible treatment option (identifying the 'similarity in variation' between 'time' and 'cancer increase' and other 'variable increases/decreases') is possible by identifying 'stressor balance' as a powerful variable in determining health (identifying a 'stress' interface and a 'stressor/handler ratio' rather than identifying the 'similarity in variation')
            - this is possible bc there are often alternate similarities that are relevant to a problem (the 'similarity in variation across interfaces like stress/time' and a 'similarity in the "stressor" variable across problems') which are different similarities connecting different structures but are relevant (interact with similar or related variables)

    - identify useful structures like 'unidentified inputs to workflows' that are useful to connect to other useful structures like 'function sets' to avoid using other useful structures like 'filters' (once these function set connections are known, standard filters of the standard solution space in regression are less useful than queries of these function sets or their similarity indexes)
        - for example, identifying 'useful/optimal states of variable interactions that a function could represent' is useful to identify 'highly probable functions', and identifying connections of these functions to other useful function sets like 'required functions, core functions, and maximally different functions' is useful to identify why functions dont always arrive at those useful function states (like bc of specific error structures or bc of state progressions toward those useful states), which are inputs to workflows like 'change a base solution function' (first identify all the useful known/adjacent functions that could solve a problem in some system, then identify why a function might differ from those optimal states of a function, such as system complexity requiring more complex functions)
        - similarly, identifying 'interface inputs' to other core interaction functions like 'reduce' like 'maximal differences' and 'similarity indexes' and 'interfaces' as well as identifying inputs to useful functions in general (across functions or function types) is similarly useful as identifying inputs to 'change' (in 'change a base solution'), as well as identifying 'optimizations of input/output connections and optimizations of outputs that will avoid needing the original function in future (applying self-invalidation structures to optimize a function such as storing input/output indexes)' and connecting these inputs by identifying their similarity indexes and generative variables is similarly useful, just like how 'connecting solutions and connecting solution metrics and connecting problems/solutions is useful', so is 'connecting workflow function inputs' given their core similarity of their common type of structure, similar to how 'connecting other structures of a type like connecting requirements' and 'connecting interface structures like functions to core structures like "directions/values/ratios/angles"' is useful
            - this is related to 'identifying the useful inputs to workflows/functions' like 'identifying the useful structures to find/reduce/connect/generate' (like 'find a ratio of some variable, to differentiate these structures' or 'find a ratio to optimize this conflicting interaction between these opposing variables', then 'find which variable to compare in a ratio', thereby usefully specifying the uncertainties/variables of previous intents), which is useful to specify and apply as a 'default/general problem-solving intent'

    - identify useful structures like specific mappings between concepts/math structures that can fulfill general problem-solving intents like 'identify the ratio/angle/other numerical structure that contains the variation of relevant differences in problems or the variation of a concept relevant to problems'
        - for example, identifying a 'spectrum of complexity' where complexity is mapped directly to numerical values is useful as a 'numerical concept mapping' which can be combined with other numerical concept mappings to directly identify concepts in specific number structures (the existing numerical spectrum mapping of 'counted steps' as a proxy for complexity is one mapping, but is not the ideal mapping as it leaves out other structures like 'lack of relevant simplicity structures' like 'missed opportunities for simplifications as in over-complications' and other errors), which is likely to be possible with a network organized in specific ways like where 'different nodes occupy different positions around some core base which theyre all similar to so that angles between nodes reflect these differences and the value can be mapped to a number (which is a set of values between 0/360)', though there are other possible organizations that reflect differences better in some numerical value like an 'angle/ratio', which is valuable to generate/filter
        - this mapping involves identifying a 'complexity unit (such as a "specific unit of difference from optimal relevant simplifications") mappable to a value that can be iterated to increase complexity' or a 'complexity metric mappable to a value' or a 'vertex that contains the variation of complexity in comparing the two perspectives/graphs from that position like "difference from over-complications" and "difference from over-simplifications"' or an 'area or parameter of complexity' or a 'aggregated/average/net/other summary metric of difference from an optimal complexity vector/matrix'
        - similarly, identifying useful structures like 'non-volatile similarity indexes of relevant optimality (such as optimal complexity)' where 'differences from these indexes indicate over-complexity or over-simplifications' is useful as an organizational structure that would be useful to identify, such as identifying 'difference from algorithms that use mostly only adjacent resources like functions, and only use a low ratio of iterations, and use no unnecessary/repeated functions' or 'difference from requirements/solution metrics' or 'difference from general over-complications/simplifications (as opposed to specific errors, given some optimal solution for a specific problem)' or 'difference from structures that are useful in understanding complexity like complexity variables/inputs/causes/limits/generators/descriptions' as a way to value 'complexity of an algorithm' (as in 'if it doesnt help define complexity or reduce complexity or reduce general complexity, its not complex')
        - other useful structures that contain a high degree of variation are 'parameters determining an infinite series', the 'parameters of the most similar/different functions', etc
        - building interface queries as having these known useful/high variation/solution structures as components like building combinations of a 'numerical abstraction ratio' and a 'unifying base concept to position other changes adjacently to' and 'numerical concept mapping' and a 'similarity angle using that base concept as the common point' is useful as a default set of structures to apply changes in between to create interface queries, or alternatively 'identifying how structures like queries of these structures can be used/organized optimally' is similarly useful to avoid generating all possibilities and filtering them
        - relatedly, identifying 'why not to use a solution that fulfills some ratio of solution metrics' involves how the energy spent identifying/applying that solution could be better allocated to inventing some new structure that is generally useful, as a specific solution that is optimal in many ways might not be generally useful and is therefore actually suboptimal when its meaning is compared to the generally useful structure (rather than trying to 'identifying algorithms to organize systems so that victims can kill all predators', 'inventing tools to prevent predators from being predators such as "algorithms to separate victims and predators" or "algorithms to identify and oppose predatory intents/inputs"')

    - identify useful structures like 'new connections between solutions/errors' which can act like problem-solving workflows or general problem-solving intents
        - for example, its likely possible to create every error type by iterating in a particular direction or iterating another one-dimensional structure, given that most errors can be represented in one variable (like a 'difference structure from some similarity'), so identifying the structures of errors like sequences that are likely given some dimension in which they can occur is likely to be useful as a general problem-solving intent
            - for example, repetition can make some structure seem both true and false depending on the other repetitions occurring and the number/ratio of repetitions (repeating it to a low degree creates a possible error of seeming true, repeating it to a high degree creates a possible error of seeming false)
            - every structure can be used to create every error type so identifying the 'distant/adjacent' structure/error index is useful as a default set to apply
        - identifying every format of a solution structure that can constitute 'some combination or other structure of errors' given the correct solution (every polynomial that can represent every combination of errors, given the solution) is a useful index to compute, which is useful to identify whether some error applies to an incorrect solution to identify the correct solution given the errors of that incorrect solution
        - identifying the connections between 'current info (solution function to the original data set) and potential optimized info (optimized function in the system that created the original data set)' is useful as an alternate problem to solve than regression (optimize the data set until it reaches some optimal interaction function, rather than trying to identify the current description function)
        - identifying 'subset selections' that indicate types or abstractions that describe reality is useful (such as identifying interface structures) bc there is a set that can be modified with specificity or another interface change and contain a solution in at least one of the items, which is useful to find the correct abstraction level of so that the default can represent the most adjacent state of each item to other useful structures
        - formatting 'filters' as 'variables/changes' can be useful to identify the 'changes that will make some difference resolved or obvious' or 'create other changes that are useful in some way like uniqueness or already identified' or identify 'filters of subsets of variables' and 'networks of subsets of variables that respond the most to these filters' and a 'merging/integration strategy for those subsets of variables'

    - identify useful structures like 'pre-filtered or specified variants' of structures 'known to be useful or required for another useful structure' like a 'high variation function' like 'organize'
        - for example, identifying useful structures like 'specifications of inputs to useful structures' like 'specific networks (such as specialized networks)' that are useful for the 'organize' function (useful by making it more trivial to implement) is a useful general problem-solving intent, once structures like 'networks/groups/types/sorts/variables' are determined to be useful for 'organize' functions (an input intent to this general problem-solving intent)
        - this is useful to identify bc there arent a high count of possible variables that would be useful ('specialized' being a variant of an interface structure, which is related to the set of possible variables that are useful through 'creating high ratios of difference'), so finding the one variable to apply to a structure to make it useful is often trivial, given that a 'specialized network' (such as functions with non-overlapping functionality) can be trivially generated/tested given that description, and the more filtered/specific the description, the more trivial it is likely to be to generate a useful structure fulfilling that description (assuming no contradictions or other errors in the specification), where functions that are difficult to generate for a highly specified description are a likely source of 'orthogonal variables/interfaces'
        - relatedly, identifying 'implementations' of useful structures like 'multi-functionality' is useful, such as 'storing small indexes of high info variables like intent/requirements that are easily differentiated to avoid errors like incorrectly merging them and are therefore more manageable' and 'switching cost reductions' and 'overlapping functionality fulfilling multiple intents at once, where other intents are adjacent to the overlapping similarity (organized around a core similarity)' and 'predictions of task requirements/sequences (useful for finding imminent overlaps or other optimization opportunities)'

    - identify useful structures like 'new directions to apply variation in' which are useful like 'generating new structures first, finding out what they are adjacently useful for, and finding new useful intents fulfilled by those adjacent intents made trivial by those structures'
        - for example, generating new math structures and identifying new ways they can be used and identifying what intents could be fulfilled with those ways/structures is useful as a way to identify/filter new intents (making things more trivial/usable makes them likelier to be used for some intent that is fulfilled with that usage), rather than building interface queries around intents as a base
        - relatedly, ratios can be avoided this way, such as by identifying alternatives so that a ratio between a subset isnt required to be computed, since identifying the relevance/meaning of all math structures will identify 'equivalent meanings' like 'ratios that compare pre-computed sequences', so that identifying the 'relatively quick convergence of some sequence' to fulfill an intent like 'find a quickly converging sequence' can be avoided by 'identifying the relevance as in interactivity of convergence and therefore its inputs' so that convergent ratios can be identified first (in reverse) and the intents requiring them can be quickly determined using this 'convergence relevance network' ('making a network to implement a concept' being an alternate useful problem-solving structure when there is a known variable of a solution like 'convergence' in a solution structure like a 'ratio')
        - relatedly, applying 'input' or 'output' as an interface (in stacking additional variables, like a set of functions like 'analyze/authenticate inputs', 'expect/await inputs', 'proceed with input subset while waiting on other subsets (async)' 'accept inputs', 'parse inputs', 'negotiate inputs', 'identify/define inputs', etc vs. 'return outputs', 're-process outputs', 'recurse outputs', etc) is a possibly useful source of variation in input/output variables like power/efficiency, given how the input or output interface can support a lot more variation on their own
        - relatedly, iterating 'reversible changes' would create structures that are useful for intents like 'encrypt', and similar 'iterations of specific change types' as well as 'combinations of change types like reversible/unique' can be identified as useful for other intents
            - why is an 'interface variable' change like 'reversible/unique change so powerful? bc these are abstract, high variation changes (there are many definitions/interpretations/implementations of 'reversible') and when stacked or otherwise structured, they create other abstract high variation changes, which are useful
        - relatedly, identifying useful filters of interface queries 'tests that determine info by creating/changing it' such a 'test of the truth which, when applied, changes the truth that would have been true' (a 'statement that is only true if tested, or that is only false if not tested' which involves 'changing the truth being tested by applying the test')

    - identify useful structures that are useful to connect to fulfill new intents like 'identify new useful indexes to compute' or 'identify variables of a useful structure like new problem differences or new function variables'
        - for example, identifying useful combinations is a matter of identifying combinations that connect with, connect, use, or otherwise fulfill core interaction functions of interface structures (combinations that make some adjacent concept to some new interaction level, combinations that can be iterated to create another combination, combinations that optimize some ratio, combinations that are optimal when applied on some base, etc), so these can be iterated to generate useful intents to fulfill which will be useful for solving problems in general ('identifying causes/inputs/combinations/indexes/filters of combinations that optimize some ratio' is a generally useful intent that is likely to be usable/adjacent to solving problems in some format), where the more interactive the structure, the likelier it is to be useful for problem-solving in general, so 'connecting core structures with core functions and other interface structures' is a useful index/function to identify
            - relatedly, identifying 'multi-function structures' (and their useful connections/variables/iterations) is approximately equal to identifying a problem-solving function, and identifying associated/opposing/limiting structures of 'multi-function structures' like 'multi-format structures' are useful as 'contexts for these multi-function structures to be applied in' or to 'invalidate the multi-function structures', these structures also being useful across interfaces
        - 'identifying problem-solving sequences' (like 'optimal problem-solving sequences that align inputs/outputs and are valid') is a simple example of 'identifying a new difference type to resolve' other than simply applying interface structures to resolve connections between problems/solutions, which is fulfilled by 'iterating a problem to create a problem sequence/network/grid', and 'identifying new default positions/functions that make a problem difficult' is another example of 'identifying a new difference type to resolve', which is fulfilled by 'changing variables of relevant problem metrics, like problem complexity'
        - relatedly, identifying the 'average/extreme function implementing some intent' is a useful function metric to connect orthogonal variables like numerical concepts like 'average' and semantic concepts like 'organize' (the 'average' reverse function, the 'extreme' organize function), which is useful if there is a similarity index that makes these semaantic functions evaluatable with these numerical references
        - relatedly, identifying an optimal sequence/set/grid/network/index that can create useful structures with some trivial combination/change/sequence is generally useful (as opposed to 'finding a network that can create most structures using some sequence/query on the network or some combination', generalizing that to include other formats/structures/functions)

    - identify useful structures like 'alignments in validity' that fulfill problem-solving intents like 'filter interface queries'
        - for example, high variation connections exist within the 'interface' definition (which has alternates like formats/filters/standards/perspectives) which are connected by these definitions and also contain high variation so theyre automatically useful connections, which are a default set of connections to apply in order to fulfill validity requirements in other positions, like in sequential interface queries (connecting filters/standards is likely to be useful to solve a problem bc its an existing valid connection)
        - new examples implementing abstract connections/intents like 'identify useful structures that fulfill useful intents' are useful enough (if connecting high variation/abstract variables) to be their own workflow, as in 'specific examples of abstract connections'
        - relatedly, identifying that 'conditions occur in extreme states and may result from those states' identifies a general intent of 'avoiding extremes' and 'avoiding position changes in extreme directions', so identifying any high variation structure like a 'useful structure that is used for many functions (like quercetin or inositol or cortisol or vitamin d)' is also likely to identify 'possible causes of conditions in some distorted state near extremes'
            - relatedly, condition types are likely to occur where these structures are used the most (bc of the required high interactivity) or where theyre used the least (likely having no way to handle an excess of that structure)
            - similarly, replacing a 'dysregulated structure like dysregulated nutrients (such as l-fucose or inositol)' with an 'artificial/external source' can avoid the 'processes requiring the creation of those dysregulated structures' (decreasing the process that creates the dysregulated structures) which might be the cause of other errors like conditions

    - identifying unconnected structures like 'similarity to relevant functions like maximally different functions' and 'concepts like sensitivity' in useful positions like 'uncertainty spaces'
        - identifying conceptual validity structures, like 'conceptual errors that make some function difference acceptable within some solution metric' such as how a 'sensitivity error' can be irrelevant in determining the correctness of a generally accurate function
            - similarly, identifying the 'networks that can connect these alternate error ranges' is useful, such as the network of 'functions with a high error ratio if wrong (as in extreme functions near limits of ranges)' and 'functions with a low error rate and high adjacency area (like averages)', and identifying the costs of these functions and a network to optimize navigation between these costs/functions
            - relatedly, identifying the functions that optimize (by 'maximizing') the 'equivalent/similar function area' are functions that can be changed and still be similarly accurate
            - relatedly, identifying the differences that connect 'approximations/completions' are likely to be useful as 'identifiers/filters of approximations'
            - relatedly, filtering interface queries can be applied by applying filters like high cost queries which are unlikely to be useful and identifying different query costs is useful for filtering these queries based on cost
        - identifying usefulness of concept sets like 'abstract/specific' (abstract concepts like 'power' having potentially more variability than required in the uncertainty space in linear regression, compared to other specific input/output comparison variables like 'volatility') to identify where those concepts will help explain the most variation
        - identifying what is balanced (independent variables and opposing variables and other differences where one is not optimal absolutely)
        - relatedly, identifying the determining structures (like determining conceptual intersections or connections between most concepts in the space) in the uncertainty space in regression is useful to identify as there are likely useful points around which most variation occurs or is limited by

    - identifying useful structures like solution structures such as 'starting solution formats' (like a line/subset for the regression problem) that are useful for various intents like 'combinations that adjacently create new structures that havent been used to solve a problem which are likely to be useful through similarity to other useful structures)
        - relatedly, identifying useful structures like the overlap between 'info and intent' is useful (when info constitutes intent and when function is structure and when structure is potential)
        - identifying the point where '"application" of a structures becomes required bc relevant info to that structure has been "identified"' is useful as a way to identify useful structures like points between iterations of general problem-solving functions
        - relatedly, identifying other structures comparable to vertexes is useful, such as iterations of vertexes, overlapping concepts, other variants of cross-interface structures, and other combinations of interface structures that can be used to solve problems like vertexes can, like 'alternate causal (horizontal alternate difference) and input causal similarities (causal distance)' which are a highly covering set of causal structures similar to how vertexes cover enough info to solve most problems
        - 'error structures of overlaps' can be identified by changing interface structures like position of defined structures ('applying the similarity as in the overlapping section, to the difference as in the non-overlapping section' which is a position change error that can describe other error structures using it)
        - relatedly, 'applying solution structures to see if the structure changes' is related to 'applying errors to errors to change errors'
        - relatedly, applying 'mixes of starting solution formats' (like an average line or a subset line as a starting solution format for regression) can be useful, such as connecting averages/subsets to find 'averages of subset lines that cover a high ratio of the input range', which is related to how lines can be trivially altered to create probable different functions (like 'overlapping lines being separated to create a polynomial from a straight line')
        - identifying unnecessary structures like 'variables that can be constants' such as 'noise' to identify error signals like 'over-use signals' to identify the connections that make otherwise irrelevant variables useful

    - identifying useful structures like 'connections between interface structures' that can identify alternate intents to apply as 'general optimizations/problem-solving intents'
        - for example, errors like 'dependence/control/isolation' tend to co-occur 'bc they are related as they are variants of each other, and bc they are adjacent', so dependence is likely to occur where there is isolation, as opposed to errors like randomness and missing info which are unrelated, as they are co-occurring 'bc they are default states'
        - identifying the 'reasons why' solutions/errors 'have some structure like a combination' is useful for predicting other errors, given one error, which is useful to skip computations/iterations
        - relatedly, there are alternate functions to 'increase the value of some structure (like currency or queries on a network)', other than 'organize', which can be used to increase value with efficient connections, such as 'control/isolation' which can be used to create 'dependence' and therefore falsely increase the value of the resource being depended on (which is why monopolies can charge more money for the same resources), although these solutions have inefficiencies/errors that other solutions like 'organize' doesnt, where 'control/isolation' looks easier, but has other errors associated with it which are costly to correct (too often its successful at creating errors like over-dependence, rather than creating infinite supplies of value), whereas the cost of organizing has only the 'cost of identifying/maintaining/updating the efficient connection network'
        - connecting these default suboptimal solutions with more optimal solutions is a matter of identifying optimizations like 'applying a monopoly on organizing networks to create enough value out of these organizing networks that it offsets the dependence cost created by the monopoly, while its making users independent with its organizing networks' which can be used as interim solutions while other connections are being identified to other optimal states
        - this involves 'identifying connections and other structures between errors' and 'identifying connections to oppose those connections' and 'identifying optimal usages of those connections and optimizations of those connections'
        - relatedly, identifying how 'connecting problems/solutions' is related to 'identifying all requirements (requirements representing problems) or connecting requirements/resources' is useful to 'identify the structures that invalidate/fulfill the most requirements' as implementing a 'connect problems/solutions' intent
            - for example, identifying 'iterations of some requirement until an error is reached' is useful for 'invalidating that requirement' and similarly, 'identifying iterations that cause errors' is generally useful for 'invalidating requirements'
        - relatedly, given that a 'optimal ratio' is useful to solve problems in some format (requiring a 'balance between structures that when different from its optimal value, causes other errors'), identifying the alternate useful structures to create 'alternate balanced ratios' or identifying 'stabilizing/limiting structures to make these balances more robust' or identifying 'alternate balance points than the already identified point' or otherwise 'invalidating the requirement' is useful (such as 'requiring a balance between immune factors, or a balance between growth requirements/stress' being invalidated by structures such as a 'nanobot or senolytic that gets rid of over-stressed cells', or a 'mechanical kidney to allow a higher ratio of processing of stressed cells to occur')

    - identify useful structures like 'unidentified specifications (like structures/formats/examples)' of a general structure like an abstract error such as an interface error (like a 'missing reason/intent/cause')
        - for example, 'missing the point' can take various forms, including 'mistaking the summary function, with the appropriate base/average properly centered so that the different data points from that function are irrelevant' and 'mistaking the start/endpoint of an intent, by mistaking the goal (endpoint), connecting function to the goal (solution), cause of/reason for the goal (as in the starting point and the difference from the starting point)' and similar structures like 'mistaking the differentiation between ambiguous alternates (as in missing a subtle but relevant difference that changes everything)' and 'fulfilling relevant requirements' and 'avoiding intent-invalidating/contradicting structures' bc these variables are powerful/relevant as in 'high variation-covering/determining' and therefore necessarily overlap with interfaces like intent
        - relatedly, identifying other abstract errors is useful as a default set to identify, such as 'incomplete maps', 'unspecified abstract definitions', etc

    - identifying useful structures like 'probable errors in default implementations of useful structures which could invalidate their usefulness' to optimize useful structures and filter interface queries
        - for example, the workflow of 'identifying new adjacent concepts' (identifying adjacent concepts as in a 'n-1 complexity function' of a n-complexity function) has a possible error in its implementation of 'identifying the pattern to identify the abstraction that connects a set of structures' of 'missing the correct high variation variables to vary and abstracting those away' (such as where n-1-complexity functions cant be rotated/otherwise trivially changed to generate all n-complexity functions, if some relevant variation such as 'flexibility' is removed with abstraction) and instead applying constants/variation in the incorrect positions ('holding n-1 sequences constant and/or trivially varying them', rather than 'finding the value lower than n-1 that can be trivially changed/combined to generate all n-complexity functions'), which will seem correct or sufficiently correct at first for some cases similar in pattern to the n-1 complexity function, which is related to identifying the correct 'interaction level where relevant variation is maximized' (some value less than n-1, with specific positions of abstraction)
        - identifying 'errors in useful structures like workflows given their likely/adjacent implementations' is a source of variables to determine filters of interface queries that implement intents like workflows (to avoid abstracting the incorrect structure, as in an error of hiding relevant variation, when looking for new abstractions)
        - identifying 'uncertainties' as a 'default position to apply changes to' is useful, such as how general problem-solving intents arent guaranteed to be the 'only directions of change to apply changes in' (theres an uncertainty whether current problem-solving intents like 'identify all the solutions in the regression problem space up to some complexity n that adjacently describes other variable interactions', so applying changes to those intents (changes like horizontal connections across these intents to identify interaction levels, as opposed to always 'applying changes in those relevant identified useful directions') could be useful for some unidentified intent (applying the 'vertex of horizontal/vertical change' to 'uncertainty positions')
            - relatedly, identifying 'sequences of vertexes that are useful to connect and apply in that sequence to identify new changes' is useful
            - for example, 'applying higher complexity s-curves to model uncertainty in activations, as opposed to simpler 2-value functions' is useful to reflect that 'lack of guaranteed correctness of understanding of identifying more optimal filters'
        - similarly, identifying the 'directions of correlated change that create all relevant changes', so that these correlations can be used to generate other relevant changes (like how 1-to-1 maps can be changed to generate other relevant changes, and changes in an average metric generate relevant changes, so that a 'simple difference like a increase/decrease in this structure creates a corresponding increase/decrease in accuracy') and the 'positions where changes based on those positions explain more variation' (positions around which most variation occurs or specifically where most problematic differences occur), which is different from 'applying adjacent changes like adding/removing or trivially increasing/decreasing some explicitly defined variable in a data set' and instead involves 'identifying the one unit that can be trivially changed to create all relevant variation in the metric (like accuracy)'
            - this 'unit/metric correlation where "trivial increases/decreases from the unit" increase/decrease the metric error (like inaccuracy)' is useful to identify so that other structures can be based on it (like identifying 'reasons for in/accuracy' or 'reasons to apply maximal differences from this "identified increase/decrease subset" to check for other minima/maxima')
            - this is related to how different positions in a problem-solving sequence can be varied to solve problems ('changing a base solution structure like a "probable solution range" for one problem to solve another problem' is a way to skip 'filtering a solution space to identify that range'), which identifies related intents like 'identifying the problems that cover sufficient variation that their solution structures like solutions/indexes can be iterated as in varied indefinitely to solve all problems'
            - similarly, 'infinities cant be trivially changed to solve all problems, despite containing the variation to solve all problems', bc of the 'rigidity in the definition of the infinity (the pattern in the infinity creating a similarity that may not contain the variation required to solve problems adjacently)' keeping it non-adjacent from some solutions and the 'lack of specificity in filtering its useful structures for specific problems'
        - defining infinities as 'extremes of iteration' is useful for 'identifying other variants of these structures' (what are the generators of extremes and the convergences of extremes, etc) and 'identifying limits of problem-solving queries that apply extreme iterations and therefore overlap with infinities', since most structures can be modeled as convergent infinities but this is less useful than other formats
            - relatedly, 'identifying filters of infinities that can be used to solve core problems' (mapping subsets to variation required to solve a problem) is a useful intent
        - similarly, identifying useful 'alternatives' is possible by identifying 'interactivities' (such as how identifying drug interactions also identifies some possible alternatives, since 'compounding effects' are a possible drug interaction), which 'identifies a subset of overlapping functionality (it both interacts and possibly also compounds) as an alternative way to identify the other overlapping function, given only info about one function'
            - similarly, identifying 'required structures' is a way of 'identifying probable inputs to/causes of conditions', since if its required, it will be available, and if its available, it will likely be used in some way to create the condition

    - identify useful structures like workflows such as 'connect problem inputs/solution outputs with alternate connections' that can be applied to useful structures like 'ratios between high variation variables'
        - for example, identifying inputs/outputs of ratios like the 'causes of relevant differences' (such as 'systems that allow variants to develop and also require those variants to compete or otherwise interact') and 'causes of usefulness' (such as 'multi-functionality' or 'stability in many contexts') is useful to 'align these intents so they overlap' and 'create different connections than ratios', thereby avoiding the requirement to identify/optimize for a ratio
        - similarly, identifying interactive/obviating variables like the 'standard/base that makes some ratio obvious' is similarly useful for intents like 'resolving relevant differences' (in a different way than identifying ratios and optimizing those ratios, as an alternative to identifying ratios), such as how extremifying variables make some differences so obvious that they dont need to be standardized first (standardizing as in 'identifying/removing their similarities') because the extreme difference makes the relevant differences obvious (therefore invalidating the similarities in a different way than removing them), which can take the form of identifying 'how a change will create/enable other useful changes without iterating it to create a structure that needs to be compared with a similar relevant structure, therefore invalidating the ratio identification/evaluation', which can allow skipping standardization/iteration, which involves 'identifying useful iterations before iterating', which is a generally useful problem-solving intent (and similarly variants like 'identifying useful function applications before applying the function, with some degree of probability of usefulness' are similarly useful to identify), which can be solved with structures like 'networks of connections between differences' (what differences will be created by some difference and which of those are useful) and 'identifying the position of uncertainties/variation' (to justify iterations/differences in that structure, such as 'unidentified interactions between definitions' or 'new/uniterated iterations' or 'missing concepts in a system of some complexity/metric that indicates enough differences to have concepts to identify', where iterations have potential to be new useful concepts/structures that could invalidate those iterations, meaning the iterations can create other differences)
        - relatedly, identifying alternate metrics to determine some ratio is useful, like how identifying 'which structure is more powerful' can be determined by 'whether the structure fulfills its intents' and 'whether the structure has more complex intents to fulfill', which are complementary intents to 'standardizing/determining the original ratio of power' bc information fragments into intents differently in different angles on the same interaction level (applying interfaces like standard/structure/intent to determine adjacent intents, adjacent intents as in on the same interaction level, will identify small subsets of intents that reflect the original intent, bc many different adjacent sets can create a similarity to the original intent across interfaces), which is useful for identifying required differences in combinations/structures, such as 'if complexity is used to identify power, what other variables need to change to reflect that difference in related intents, to avoid errors like "comparing non-standardized structures"'
            - relatedly, 'interactivity/isolation' reflects similar info (both testing for functionality/independence) despite being opposite structures in some ways, bc opposite variables can reveal a structure's position on the spectrum that they reflect (applying differences can reveal a similarity, like applying a similarity can), and identifying other similarities than 'opposites within a definition/spectrum' that can be varied without changing the useful info reflected by a structure is similarly useful to identify (structures other than opposites might over-standardize and invalidate differences too frequently)
        - relatedly, systems are useful to apply as 'queries which force/require a variable like interactivity/dependence, either directly or through the variables/limits of a system, therefore identifying some useful information', and identifying which other variables are valuable when forced/required (as in 'applied as a constant') is useful to identify systems that will make some information obvious (forcing variables that act like alternates to interactivity), and 'identifying what info is obvious once some variable is forced/required' is a useful index to compute
        - relatedly, the structure of 'creativity in math' can take the form of applying various interface structures like generally useful intents such as 'identify new sources of variation (like definitions that havent interacted in some system yet)' or 'apply a function from a maximally different angle (like apply limits to infinities, rather than apply differences to core structures like units)' or 'identifying new standards/systems/intents that simplify some comparison or other core intent (identifying variation that can exist or can be optimized/iterated/determined in some system/standard)' or 'identifying new similarities/connections between different structures that differ from defined similarities/connections (like identifying some concept that connects variables in different systems in a way that is not directly referenced by definitions, requiring creativity to identify this different usage/connection of definitions)'
        - relatedly, identifying functions that can resolve ambiguities is possible by identifying functions with 'differences according to different inputs (such as sensitivities/volatilities)', given that ambiguities are false similarities, so identifying the functions that 'create the most differences for the most sets of different structures that can seem ambiguously similar (or similar structures that can seem ambiguously different)' is a useful intent
        - relatedly, identifying useful alternatives to definitions than 'specific examples of a concept in some system sets that covers enough of its variation to be an approximation of a definition' is useful as a way to identify similarities (like structures similar to a concept like 'power') which are abstract and cover a high ratio of connections, such as 'directions/limits of change (which when iterated create the conceptual structure in some system or create its definition or create its defining variables)' or 'iterations that create a concept (units of the concepts or useful differences to connect when identifying the concept)' like identifying 'directions of change which lead to power' (applying changes to functions is a way to identify function structures like specific input/output connections such as powerful connections) or 'structures that identify power or create it' (structures like filters/variables that can differentiate between power or other structures or metrics of power) or 'structures that when iterated in some way create power like "coordinating functions" which lead to power such as multi-functionality', all of which are variants of a typical definition that identifies 'some example of a powerful structure or its differentiating variables', given how identifying 'directions of change that lead to some concept' is useful for other useful intents like 'skipping/predicting iterations'

    - identifying useful structures like structures that are more useful when some other structure is known, like 'more probable functions, given some set' which is useful once functions have been filtered by identifying 'iterated interface structures of function differences', where their common structures ('probability') make those structures useful to connect
        - for example, 'identifying the more probable functions, given some set of differences like points deviating from a line' and 'identifying the more probable functions, given some set of generally improbable or incorrect functions like a straight line and a line intersecting with every point' is useful once some set of interface structures has been applied, like a 'probability of interface structures like a simplification of a function, given some function similarity index being applied iteratively', such as how a 'simpler difference between functions' indicates that the simpler functions created by that difference in that iteration of a similarity index are more probable as solutions, in sequences of conversions between similar functions, which is applying 'interface structures (probabilities/simplifications) of differences between functions on some similarity index' in a useful way, rather than evaluating functions and their differences in isolation, to identify the 'simplification on some similarity index that avoids improbable functions'

    - identify useful structures like 'alternative optimizations' that can be used for general problem-solving intents like 'making structures useful'
        - for example, identifying that trivial steps are more valuable in an organized system (such as a 'system designed to arrange differences to be extreme at trivial steps') is useful to identify alternate optimizations to increase the value of a structure (the value of a trivial step can be extremely high in an organized system), adding value taking the form of increasing the power of each step by arranging differences in a pattern to optimize that value, thereby increasing value of a step without changing some metrics like the step size while changing other metrics what it connects (maximal differences) (similar to how a dollar is worth more than a dollar in a highly organized system, and similarly a dollar spent organizing a system is worth more than a dollar)
        - this is bc the 'efficient connectivity' created by organization makes it possible to 'change other variables' (like 'change positions within the organization' or 'exchange resources with other agents in the organization') at low cost, making each dollar go farther/faster using these efficient connections (such as efficient searches created by efficient connections like indexes)
            - similarly, identifying optimal usage/implementation structures is similarly useful, such as how an index is more useful when 'sorted and within a certain size range', otherwise generative/filtering functions of the items indexed and variation/pattern/similarity-identification functions are more useful than indexes on either side of that case, so mapping these cases, applying these structures to optimize other structures (applying sorts/size ranges to determine other areas of optimality), and identifying how these structures change for other structures (structures that are 'more indexable' are more 'useful to index', up to the point where their patterns are identifiable and they can be generated) are useful to identify, similar to how a index or map is more useful when 'there is a 1-to-1 map (or similarly low ratio that simplifies the mapping), and the connection function would be more complicated to identify, and only a subset of inputs is frequently used, and its useful to just store a direct map rather than connect these distant or semi-arbitrary variables (like passwords/names which are often adjacent to the creator but in sufficiently different ways like "recency/other prioritized biases" that theyre not always adjacent to filter)'
        - identifying other optimization structures to 'increase the value of a structure' are useful to identify, such as how converting dead-ends into cycles is useful to avoid less optimal structures (dead-ends, that cant interact with other structures but are useful as limits)
        - relatedly, 'identifying structures/functions to integrate structures that fulfill different metrics (a realistic/probable degree of complexity, a value below some cost threshold, etc)' is useful as a general problem-solving intent and as a network to identify (applying a multi-functional structure at every network node), just like 'structures/functions to reduce cost of other structures' is generally useful
        - similarly, as a specific implementation of a general 'ratio between sequences/iterations/aggregations (or other high variation structure)' to solve problems, 'identifying the ratio of difference from integrated solution metrics' is useful as a general problem-solving intent, 'integrated solution metrics' being the 'highest variation, most relevant structure' and therefore being generally useful to identify differences from
        - relatedly, identifying alternate uncertainty spaces is useful to connect more identifiable uncertainty spaces to (once the polynomial uncertainty space is fully described, how to connect that space to other spaces with higher variation to store more uncertainty once the uncertainty is gone in that space, meaning once all the conceptual solution metric integrations have been fully identified in the space between linearity/randomness, as in, 'what is higher variation/relevance than the difference between linearity/randomness in the polynomial regression problem space', which is where the next set of problems will occur and be solved, and what uncertainty spaces connect all these uncertainty spaces and should that connecting space be solved for first)

    - identify useful structures like similarities across sequences/components of interface queries that make them interchangeable for some intent to find alternate queries and filter queries
        - for example, identifying the alignment between 'analysis points (in between other function sets like filter/generate)' as well as the structure of common patterns like 'alternating variables/constants' and the usefulness of 'n-degree structures (like how concepts emerge after several degrees, rather than in direct 1-degree connections)' as structures that can be usefully aligned in interface queries (positioning 'alternating variables/constants' in positions where 'sequences like generate/filter' are applied, and 'positioning n-degree emergent structures to align with analysis points or sequences that can analyze these iterated structures'), given that this iterated structure allows for 'realistic/probable complexity' (as opposed to smaller/shorter structures like units), making it multifunctional by representing the intersection between multiple metrics
        - for example, 'generosity/optimism' is only justified up to n degrees in many sequences, otherwise it becomes an 'error' or another different structure, so 'positioning an analysis point after n degrees in queries' is a useful application of that alignment, so that identifying the structures that actually implement optimism and the structures which cross this threshold and become errors can be identified
        - similarly a 'ratio' (a tool of analysis used to implement a 'analyze/compare' function as well as 'generate' combinations using some ratio and 'filter' subsets using some ratio) can be applied as a probably useful structure at these points, which is useful to apply connections to, in order to identify functions to format workflows/queries as structures of 'ratios between high variation structures'
        - similarly, identifying functions to increase/decrease similarity of structures (finding a grid of points that implement some concept like 'optimism' to align with other grids or alternating structures) is useful to identify adjacent substitutes to generate new queries, and functions to increase/decrease multi-functionality of structures from different endpoints/angles/subsets is useful for the same intent
        - relatedly, identifying that a 'ratio' can be optimized/replaced with a 'map' (rather than comparing a standardized set with a ratio, determining equivalent/different values in different non-standardized formats using a map between formats and determining the emergent differences created which make some more relevant difference clear), similar to how 'optimizing some structure' can replace the requirement to evaluate the ratio
        - relatedly, identifying how errors like 'dependence/stupidity/addiction' are related (they are states/positions/types/functions that create/are errors from error structures like over-prioritization or incompleteness of the same concept) is useful to identify new connections between error structures ('there is an error function like stupidity that creates over-prioritization errors like over-dependence as in addiction') and identifying whether there is always/frequently/probably an error 'position/state/type/function' of some error of some concept is useful and what other structures can be combined to always/frequently/probably create an error is similarly useful
            - identifying positive variants/related structures to dependence (as in useful structures like causal networks, requirements, uniqueness, etc) can identify whether there is some structure set that always/frequently/probably creates 'error/solution structures of some concept' (which can be applied to other concepts to identify/create other solution/error structures)
        - relatedly, the reasons antimicrobials might work on cancer include that 'cancer can be harmful in similar ways as microbes' (there are only so many harmful ways to attack bio systems) and also cancer may copy functions/genes from microbes (copying genes being a common function and 'avoiding a trial/error process' being incentivized) and that 'compounds active against one attack are likely to be active against some subset of other attacks, rather than being likely to be only active against one' (multiple functions are more common than one specific function at this stage of evolution) and also 'antimicrobials are likely to occur in species that survived as in evolved different functions and are likely to be connected/similar/related to other useful functions like having activity against other attacks' (evolution is likelier to occur multiple times rather than only occurring once to develop one function), indicating that 'functions are likely to be used/created multiple times' and 'useful functions are likelier to be used multiple times' are predictive of this attribute of antimicrobials

    - identifying useful structures like different extensions of structures like ratios to identify adjacent structures that are useful (like different descriptions of the ratio-based solution as well as different problems solvable adjacently with ratios and different variants of structures that can be used to solve these problems and different variants of problems that can be solved with different variants of ratios), which is a useful network of structures to identify, given the power of these structures like ratios when applied as 'bases of solution generating processes', and similarly integrating these structures into other workflows by connecting them to other workflows is similarly useful to identify the connection network of those integrations
        - for example, identifying the structures likely to be resolvable with a ratio, such as 'errors to oppose so they cancel each other out', or 'ambiguously similar types' or 'requirements/resources which are likely to be required to interact and map' (resources are mapped to requirements) so identifying whether they are relatively equal (requirements are similarly available as resources) is useful to solve with a ratio and identifying whether they are mappable is possible with other interface structures like other maps/connections
        - given that a 'ratio (identify an equivalence) and a map set (create an equivalence)' can solve this problem of 'mapping/connecting/equating structures that need to interact such as resources/requirements', identifying what other sets of structures tend to be useful to connect maximal differences is useful as a general problem-solving intent and what problems do they directly solve (what differences are connectible with those structure sets)
        - 'identify a ratio where there should be an equivalence (between relevant structures like interactive structures)' and 'create an equivalence if there is a relevant similarity/difference (but no equivalence) identified' is useful when some connection/equivalence is known to be useful (its known that requirements/resources should interact and should be equal) and when the connection/equivalence is not connected/equivalent by default (the problematic difference from connection/equivalence)
        - other types of problems include general problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation' implemented as a set of intents resolvable with a ratio like 'identify new connections' and 'create new connections where there are no new connections identifiable in or around existing connections', given the 'ratio of new variation possible in or around existing connections' or given other problem-solving structures than 'ratios between high variation variables' like 'different bases' such as 'identifying the subset of identified variables that when applied as a base generates the most variation in combinations of those core variables', or alternative intent sequences than 'compare and equate' such as 'compare and differentiate' or 'generate variation using different inputs like different bases', which can all be solved with ratios but are adjacently solved by different structures
        - relatedly, 'holding some variables constant so some trivial difference can be more powerful' is an example of a workflow that creates useful structures like 'constants/bases', as opposed to 'applying them as inputs'

    - identify useful structures like reasons (like 'efficient' variation reflection/info storage) for usefulness that indicate variation (like other efficiencies) that hasnt been used based on that reason
        - for example, identifying 'maximally different possible meanings' of core structures (like a 'point/line') is useful, such as the 'one point of overlap between different type densities' or the 'origin around which other points vary' or the 'point a problem occupies on a graph of problems indicating its relative position compared to other problems', a 'point/line' being an 'efficient structure to represent info by comparing it to high variation structures (like concepts/types/graphs)', which is why its a problem-solving format that is useful to identify variables of and vary to create other useful problem-solving formats, which is useful bc these 'maximal differences within a similarity like within a definition' are efficiency structures that can be used to format/solve problems in
        - relatedly, identifying 'reasons for linearity of a type-differentiating line' (such as the simplicity of the type differences, the completeness of the type differences, the independence of the types, bc the line indicates a linear structures like a linear limit or barrier that keeps the types independent, etc) is useful to identify when the differentiating structures wouldnt be linear, such as when a point intersection is sufficient to determine type or when the line needs to have embedded complexity to reflect less simple differences like overlaps/ambiguities, or when one type is standardizing/absorbing the other
        - the 'linearization of a problem' can take different formats, such as indicating 'converting a problem to be solved by a linear connection on some network' or 'converting all problem structures to lines indicating connections on a network so they can be combined with other lines/connections' or 'converting all differences to lines in a network reflecting a standard number set' or 'identifying sufficiently similar structures as to be linearly combinable into the solution structure' or 'simplifying/formatting sub-problems to be a type differentiating problem solvable with a differentiating line'
            - connecting these alternate meanings of 'linearize' are useful as a standard problem-solving network to connect to other problem-solving networks in other formats
        - the structures of solution metrics are complex enough to act like interfaces (requiring many free parameters to implement the real forms of solution metrics like real virtues), so the 'network of connections between solution metrics' should be applied as a 'default set of connections' (problem-solving processes should be based on applying changes to core structures like generally useful structures, concept networks, and networks indicating realistic implementations of real virtues like solution metrics, all of which can be applied as a base solution to apply changes to in order to find new possible variation) and connected to other useful networks like generally useful intent networks, once the specific solution metric set of 'realistic implementations of real virtues' are identified to apply them as default connections
            - for example, 'creating an insight' has many parameters like health, time, usage of time to practice thinking, an input set of variables, etc, all of which have variable structures like sequences (different overlaps between time sequences are useful for creating optimal conditions for insights), even though itll seem like there is a correlation between 'simply typing on a keyboard' and 'identifying an insight', the time range needs to be expanded to include farther time sequences in order to reflect reality
            - this is why simply finding 'direct associations/correlations between variables' isnt a reality-covering function, bc there are other similarity/difference sets that can reflect the same or more info as a correlation similarity
        - relatedly, 'future creativity' is not just combining machine learning models but efficiently manually opposing their effects (with a generative AI model that is run continuously to solve new math problems, applying the opposing function manually is useful to 'analyze' solutions for accuracy/usefulness and 'filter' which solutions to manually use/analyze, and creating algorithms to invalidate the generative AI model are similarly useful as opposition structures to invalidate the generative AI model and any dependence on it, as well as identifying algorithms to automate/optimize these processes of providing alternatives to existing tech by opposing or otherwise usefully varying them, as well as creating AI algorithms that 'increase the independence/other optimization metrics' of other AI algorithms, as opposed to creating 'opposing algorithms' or 'variation-maximizing algorithms')
            - relatedly, AI model ensembles to identify new errors and identify when those errors are occurring (like when an AI is 'seeming to comply or is sabotaging its other work') is required to keep it in check and may improve a normal AI enough to approximate AGI without creating something with negative self-interests
            - relatedly, sets of functions like filter/generate/analyze are useful to identify as more useful as a set bc they indicate different types of time that can coordinate, such as 'stopping variation (such as stopping sequential time as created by filter/generate functions) when analyzing results of filter/generate functions, in order to more optimally coordinate with other functions like filter/generate, thereby increasing the speed of future time and increasing the variation possible and implemented in each time step or other unit, which has possible consequences like out-pacing the variation supported by another interface like reality thereby forcing it to collapse, or creating so much variation that this state cant be connected to a future higher variation state so there is no future, and out-predicting other universes thereby invalidating them or drawing them closer through higher variation support or creating other universe clusters possible with iterated abstractions of interfaces (given that one instance of one implementation of the abstract network describes one cluster of related universes)', and identifying these types of time that enable/optimize other types of time (like how 'horizontal variation' like 'analyze' improves other types of time by creating more efficient steps for time to take)
        - relatedly, identifying 'difference from normal (even if normal means unhealthy or atypically healthy)' as well as 'difference from healthy' and 'difference from default/natural' as an alternative base to identify differences from as causative of other differences like 'conditions' (a 'non-standard light exposure habit/pattern' being considered unhealthy but being regular enough to trigger adaptation to handle it as a new normal, where an 'adaptation capacity' is useful structure as a 'stress response' structure explaining why other adaptations might not occur, being that 'capacity is reached' or the other adaptations are 'outside the range of capacity', as 'lack of a normal non-standard light exposure pattern, like lack of a nightlight, can be a cause of cancer, due to changes in inputs to adapted cortisol production/availability')
        - relatedly, deriving errors with structures like 'irrelevant iterations of interface structures until an error is identified' is useful as well as identifying opposing/different structures to those errors, such as identifying that 'over-abstraction' can be offset by 'connecting to abstract info structures or abstract concepts like power', which have enough variation to add info through interactions with the over-abstracted structure
        - relatedly, 'non-random independence' is similarly useful to identify, as opposed to 'random independence' which occurs by default in sufficiently complex systems, as it is less useful than 'relevant/non-random independence structures' like interfaces, as in 'maximal differences within similarities like relevant limits'

    - identifying useful structures like the 'densities/commonalities within a type' that are useful to connect to create a 'cross-type/density index' through alternative info storage like probability (density within a type indicating a highly variable structure that would be useful to connect to other highly variable structures in other types), similar to how 'reasons' and 'patterns' are useful to connect through their common certainty structures (certainty acting like a density as in a powerful/common variable in the reason/pattern types that is useful to connect)
        - identifying 'structures to derive other useful structures when info is known to be missing' (like when data sufficient to identify a pattern is not available, such as 'multiple examples'), which can be replaced by similar structures such as inputs to or causes of patterns like 'momentum/intents/incentives/efficiencies' which generate/determine/change patterns (and related structures of patterns, like stability/constants/certainties), and similarly identifying the ratios/thresholds where a structure becomes a pattern (as in becomes 'predictable with some prediction function') and identifying the 'indexes of structures near these thresholds on either side' is useful to connect these structures with the patterns theyre adjacent to, meaning that 'multiple examples' arent necessary if 'reason info' is available in the first example, so identifying whether alternate equivalent or overlapping info is available is useful and possible by identifying similarities in inputs like relevance between 'constants like reasons' and 'commonness sufficient to cause a certainty structure like a pattern' (both can be certainty structures) and 'structure' (like 'causative sequences'), so identifying different 'causal sequences of certainty structures' is useful to identify alternative functions/intents to identify certainties (and certainty inputs/causes/determinants and adjacent structures like pre-certainties and certainty units and certainty/uncertainty indexes and certainty thresholds)
        - relatedly, identifying the structures of similarity reflections that info can be reflected across and still be identifiable as connected to the inputs is useful to identify structures that can remove info, for examples of opposing structures to add info (for example, can info be reflected across any primary interface and still be connectible to its original structure/position, where non-interfaces dont have this attribute)
        - this is possible bc the 'reason for a variable/function' is similar to a pattern in that it can be used to predict that variable/function just like the pattern can, although the direction of cause is variable across the reason and the pattern (the pattern in a variable might emerge above a threshold or in some specific structure, rather than indicating a reason that was already present as a cause of the variable)
        - relatedly, "structures that have different (such as 'specific') functions given different inputs/contexts" are useful to identify as they are generally useful, especially if these differences are reversible/connectible/coordinating/otherwise interactive
        - relatedly, identifying queries/indexes to convert a general function with a specific function (connecting functions in an index like 'regularly changing' -> 'regularly increasing' -> 'regularly continuously increasing') is useful to identify a 'default specification set' to apply to test a structure for general/specific relevance or add specificity/generality, where navigating this 'network of function variables' is likely more useful than filtering functions in a 'probable solution area', where most queries would likely start at common central function structures like 'regularly increasing' and select a subset of specifications to navigate outward toward maximally different functions to check for useful specifications, this network occupying a position between a 'conceptual network of variables like volatility/sensitivity' and a 'function type network or function similarity index network' bc of its useful adjacency to actual functions through its specificity in its descriptive variables and its useful efficiency in its descriptions which add generality through cross-type and other cross-structure connections ('regularly increasing' being a 'cross-function type' description), similar to how its useful to connect 'orthogonal as in non-1-to-1 mappable variables', its useful to be able to convert between certainties like probabilities/patterns
        - why is this possible? bc these similarities can coordinate in structures like 'stackings/embeddings/overlaps' ('density/commonality' similarities can occur within 'subset/type' similarities), so creating connections across these 'stacked/embedded/overlapping similarities' is useful for capturing indexes of 'alternative or missing info'
            - this is useful for identifying other structures like 'sequences of similarities that can be cycles or which can create equivalences or maximal differences' and identifying the structures that enable the most variation and which are the most useful as starting/interim/end points of queries, as well as identifying useful sequences like 'reasons for types' which encapsulate high variation, similar to 'ratios between types'

    - identifying useful connection functions between useful interface structures (like how types/ratios can be used to solve the 'filter solution functions' problem) by determining the info required (differences of subsets in the data set) and the way to fulfill that requirement (identifying types/similarity indexes of functions that connect subsets in the data set), indicating a core dichotomy set and an intersection between them (complete/global/complex connection functions and partial/local/linear subsets connection functions, applying the local/global and partial/complete vertexes to identify 'subset differentiation' as relevant and as useful to implement with 'function types'), given that 'ratios between high variation variables such as types' are generally useful abstract info problem-solving structures which are useful as a default set of structures to identify in interface queries, 'types' being very useful for 'filtering' and to 'skip iteration', and identifying a 'ratio between types (or partials/locals)' that is relevant to regression being similarly trivial
        - for example, identifying that there are 'different function types' present in a 'probable solution area' which have 'different variables/attributes relevant to the problem (relevant to the input data set reflecting input variable interactions)' is useful to identify which of these variables is more relevant/useful to the function and then randomly selecting a function having that type or stopping at the first function found with that variable/attribute as the solution, as a way to avoid iterating through many possible functions or changing a base function (function types or function similarity indexes acting as abstract functions which capture a high degree of info), based on the insight that "identifying differences in a data set's possible subset-connection functions is a prerequisite to filtering that data set or its possible solution functions", which reduces the problem of regression to 'finding a ratio between high variation variables' like the 'ratio indicating higher relevance of function types' (once function types are identified in the data set), where 'identifying the ratio of solution structures that each type covers' is another relevant ratio for selecting a function having one of those types as a solution structure
        - identifying a 'hierarchy of subsets to identify in sequence/combination/etc' is useful across function-filtering intents, identifying whether local subsets or linear subsets are more useful to identify first or in combination, etc
        - this means use 'identify types in a probable solution area, identify the useful type, and compute first function having the useful type' which is related to 'identify an average metric and computing the first function with that average metric', as opposed to 'filter possible functions in a probable solution area until error begins to increase' or 'change an upper/lower limit in a probable solution area until error begins to increase or until a solution metric ratio is crossed'
            - this method requires a good function similarity index network or function typology to be useful as well as a numerical definition of relevance like 'intersectivity' or 'adjacency to maximum points or maximum determining points'
            - applying more interface structures increases the value of a structure if done in a way that is relevant as in possible and not-invalidating to other useful metrics (applying 'determining' to 'maximum points' usefully specifies/focuses the structure to reduce the cost of applying it)
        - relatedly, applying imaginary numbers as 'regularly hidden variables with some exponential operation' is useful as a way to model realistic systems, and other hidden variable patterns like randomness and self-invalidation structures like inverses and self-reference structures like recursions are similarly useful to integrate to incorporate numerical components reflecting realistic chaos and independence and complexity, as well as identifying the ways these can hide information, as a default set of 'error structures' to look for
            - for example, applying combinations/stacks of 'waves of imaginary/self-reference/inverse structures' to see how these can look like ordinary polynomials with simple formulas is a useful similarity index to compute, as well as identifying the index of conceptual descriptions of these functions, as a way to identify what concepts systems tend to fulfill and what direction of concepts these systems tend to develop in and the net effect of these conceptual priorities
        - similarly, identifying the 'generative variables' of functions is useful to identify overlapping indexes of 'input variables to generative variables' and 'generative variables/functions', where identifying the generative variables of a few functions in a 'probable solution area' is useful to determine the other functions in that area as well as the determine/generate the optimal function in that area, where the generative variables make it trivial to determine the potential attributes of functions in that area, which is useful once the useful attributes of a solution are identified, where identifying variables and attributes emerging from those variables is another useful index to identify
        - relatedly, identifying the 'connecting network of useful abstract structures' (like 'ratios between high variation variables' and 'planification of a problem to determine its continuous determining/generative variables and position it in relation to other combinations of those variables') is similarly useful as a default network to base interface queries on, and optimizing this and other networks like 'iteration/optimization networks' for various known generally useful problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation' is likely to be useful for connecting/optimizing these networks and identifying missing networks
        - relatedly, a 'similarity index across other known differences like function types (similar functions that are different in some other way like type)' is useful for identifying 'orthogonal connections, non-1-to-1 mappings, ambiguities/false similarities' and its useful to connect and organize this index with other indexes like 'similarity-similarity indexes (functions with multiple relevant similarities, like stackable/intra-type similarities)' as a way to identify a spectrum/network/plane/structure of relevance (beyond the uncertainty space between linearity and randomness, which has a continuous 'probable solution range', as in an 'area containing the spectrum' but the 'set of uncertain functions in that space' is not itself continuous in that range structure, bc the various 'maximally uncertain/similar/ambiguous functions in that range' are not adjacent, meaning the 'average in between random/linear' is not a simple computation of the 'function between a straight line and a square')
            - similarly, identifying the 'ratio of relevance of densities' is useful in the regression problem, and identifying other ratios that are relevant in the regression problem is useful as a way of implementing this abstract info network
        - relatedly, identifying structures to connect seemingly unmappable/irrelevant intents is useful to identify abstract info structures to solve problems with and identify their connection networks, such as 'resolving the difference between problem/solution' and 'resolving the difference between new/existing variables' having a common 'relevant difference' and 'comparison' structure
        - relatedly, identifying the determining variables of these abstract info structures is useful, such as how identifying that 'common bases' determine which ratios are possible/relevant is useful as an input intent to fulfill when implementing a 'ratio-formatting function to solve problems with ratios', and 'connecting ratios/bases with the vertexes that they represent' is useful for applying either structure when one alternative is better defined or otherwise useful than the other, some structures/formats being more useful for the computational gains they allow by being more definable/verifiable/controllable
        - relatedly, identifying how 'irreversible sequences' can be formed is a way of identifying ways that time can end, bc these irreversible sequences can likely be applied to most high variation structures, and similarly identifying alignments like 'irreversibilities' and 'causal networks' and 'info loss or missing info' as well as 'filter sequences' is useful to identify useful differences to apply in those structures, such as only applying 'irreversible or otherwise sequence-dependent' functions in causal networks given the common usefulness of their 'direction' (useful for identifying sequences to avoid such as 'sequences that cause info loss and which dont lead to useful abstractions/interfaces or which cant be abstracted back to relevance', where 'applying sequences of irreversibilities that cause interfaces' is useful to identify/apply as 'base sequences of a network' to apply additional changes to like 'orthogonal cross-interface sequence connections' or 'embedded changes on interface sequences'), where the alternative (applying sequence-independent functions like multiplication, is useful for finding 'coordinating sets of changes that can create a similar change type like a similar function type')

    - identify useful structures like 'optimizations with multi-functionality or which fulfill multiple intents or which can be useful in multiple different formats, where these multiples are useful in other ways such as being maximally different' and how they connect to other useful structures like 'remaining variation or the position of variation in queries' for problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation'
        - for example, given that 'there is an optimal way to use every structure' and 'there is a way to make every structure useful for any intent', that indicates that 'all queries havent been identified if existing queries cant make something useful' which is useful for intents like 'identify new variation' (there is still variation in the set of queries)
        - implementing 'identifying new variation' in this way is possible bc the set of queries has an alignment with these variables (like variation, usages, usefulness and optimizations), where queries should reflect variation/optimizations in reality, bc of their connectivity and similarity
        - similarly, the optimal way (such as 'thinking logically, to skip the costs of testing adjacent/possible solutions in reality') is highly coordinating ('thinkers coordinate well and dont violate each other's rights as theyre mostly independent of other thinkers, having their own simulation engine to solve problems with'), so it can be used frequently by many different agents in different positions for different intents, thereby organizing activities to all improve the optimal way (as in, organizing the organizing structure of 'thinking'), which will benefit everyone who participates (like the opposite of a ponzi scheme, creating future value from real value)
        - relatedly, identifying 'grids' as 'filters' (identifying grids of optimals where 'difference from grid points' is an error set and 'units that create optimals' have been identified) and identifying 'vacillations' as 'filters' (change a line between an upper/lower limit or a general/specific limit, until the correct variant is found, once the useful limits are identified), and similarly identifying how other structures can fulfill other core useful intents like 'filter' is useful
            - relatedly, pre-computing solutions to composable/complementary problems which can be subsets of other problems (identifying subsets of a solution area where any solution in that area can be found trivially for maximally different data sets in that subset are useful to pre-compute and use as components of solution areas and identifying the interactions of these subsets other than composability is similarly useful, so that the interactions of an apparent solution for a subset with other subsets or other data sets, can be predicted given another subset or another data set), applying the workflow of 'solve components of the problem space, until those components are connectible, reflecting their similarity, such as solving subsets of a problem which are similar enough to be connectible (such as generalizable/composable/complementary/extrapolatable) and connecting them'
            - relatedly, identifying how 'probable solution areas' can be selected/generated to maximize chances of finding 'alternate equivalently optimal solutions' is useful, by identifying connections between 'equivalent alternate solutions' and the ranges which describe their solution area and the variable interactions that create these different but equivalent alternate solutions, such as identifying how random probable solution areas should be (as in 'how square/rectangular the area should be' in a problem of 'selecting a line in that area'), given that randomness increases the solution set
        - relatedly, connecting sets of interface structures like a 'specific complexity that seemed like a specific simplicity bc of an unidentified interactivity' (with alternating 'specificity/abstraction' making it generally useful as well as being useful by connecting these differences to their connecting structure) to resolve 'ambiguities or other differences between interface structures' is useful as a problem-solving workflow, connecting interface structures being generally useful as problem-solving units, as different ways to fulfill the same connection apply different info like different formats/starting points/connective structures
        - relatedly, 'identifying/deriving/generating requirements/usefulness/optimalities for interface structures in interface queries' is useful, so applying 'sequential predictors' to identify the 'next structure in an interface query' after creating a data set of queries by converting problems/solutions with interface structures (like 'alternating variable/constant structures or similarities/differences') is one way to use neural networks for this problem-solving intent, as the interface queries that 'summarize/similarize/standardize/organize the most other queries' will be findable this way, which can be used as default workflows

    - identify useful structures like variables that can impact interface queries to apply as filters of those structures (like 'controlling' interface structures/functions that should be integrated as 'points to return to' in queries bc they support more variation than other points)
        - for example, identifying that there are stable states as well as stable functions that are less likely to cause errors, these can be 'points to return to' in queries in general as bases for applying changes to, where one query fails, it can be connected to these states/positions/functions to recover from errors, similar to applying abstractions when too much info has been lost
            - these points can be 'executive/controlling points (that control analysis and other processing)' in a structure of interface queries that directs the other queries/structures, as opposed to points that cant be trusted to apply analysis from bc theyre 'unstable or incomplete or have another invalidating error', so analysis cant be applied from that point
            - this is related to the 'executive functioning' created by free parameters as being capable of controlling/containing the other parameters, and has having the option and more of a right to do that, and applying that concept to interface queries (which queries/structures get to control the others, beyond selecting for 'more powerful or higher variation variables first to apply as defaults/bases in queries', since there will inevitably be some query/structure/interface that controls the queries, such as the meaning/interface interface, and alternatives to this should be identified - like a 'free query space, where rules like "applying analysis before action" and "reducing info loss" and "identifying new variation" are prioritized intents and where other interface queries are filtered/generated/applied and where decisions like "analysis or action" can be selected and where interfaces can be controlled such as re-defined', this 'free query space' being intended to act as a consciousness evaluating the interface queries and analysis systems/rules being applied, where this space is always growing to optimize for learning and self-optimization), which is useful for 'applying differences to stable structures like optimals/interfaces/bases until new optimals/interfaces/bases are identified'
        - relatedly, 'interface queries that improve other interface queries' are relatively easy to identify such as 'reduce info loss with abstraction', which is a simple optimization to identify by combining interface structures and relatively easy to test so filtering them is trivial given how few there are in number
            - relatedly, 'trivial to verify/test' has related intents like 'trivial to identify maximal differences of its inputs to test for "coverage of inputs", such as "extreme opposites within limits"', which means applying 'tests' instead of 'filters' is useful when 'inputs are identifiable and maximal differences of inputs are identifiable' in addition to other intents like 'when a theory is identifiable, with some linear/adjacent combination of available inputs', bc the 'theory identifies some similarity connecting the inputs and the maximal differences within that similarity are known/identifiable', which is solving the problem of 'identifying overlaps/intersections in inputs and connecting that overlap/intersection with the overlap/intersection represented by the theory (given that the theory represents a new similarity/connection between variables)', so 'connecting overlaps/intersections/other sets of change types' is generally useful for identifying useful structures to connect (a new network of structures to identify)
        - relatedly, 'identifying the most differentiating variables of maximal differences' is a related useful intent across problems, where some maximal differences like 'different input types' are useful for intents like 'identifying multi-functionality' and other maximal differences as in 'different as in unique structures' are useful for 'identifying abstractions and variation sources' and maximal differences like 'self-references' are useful for intents like 'independence'
        - relatedly, identifying 'ranges of differences from optimals likely to avoid invalidating optimality' are useful to identify and identify similarities with related structures like 'probable solution areas of specific problems'
        - relatedly, identifying 'reasons why an intent is useful' is useful as a way to 'connect intents' such as how reasons why 'identify new variables' is useful (to identify new problems which can be differences and also to identify new solution structures to solve problems)
        - relatedly, identifying 'areas where interfaces dont cover information' is useful as a way to identify 'new interfaces that can connect these areas of missing info' (a variable that doesnt intersect with other interfaces will be a new variable as in different or independent from them)
        - relatedly, identifying 'n-dimensional randomness or other interface structures' is useful as a way to identify interface structures in a given dimension set, and identify structures to base limits on, and relatedly, applying changes to randomness structures is a useful structure to fulfill intents related to variation like 'identifying new variation' as a default set of structures, given that identifying 'dimensions required to solve the problem' or 'dimensions to solve the problem in' is useful for identifying structures like low-dimensional structures that will likely be useful, such as 'interfaces/vertexes/queries' that will be useful, and limiting these dimensions with pre-filters like 'probable area ranges' is useful as a way to counter the randomness allowed by increasing dimensionality
            - relatedly, identifying different definitions of complexity like "lack of simple interface structures like 'iterations'" or 'volatility created by minimal structures' or 'similarity to randomness' is useful as a more variable-covering definition than 'step count'

    - identify useful variables (like 'function types' and 'iterations' and 'aggregations' and 'volatility units') in problems described by those structures to the point of linearization of the problem by applying formats (like how there is always an 'iteration' to form useful solution concepts/variables like 'volatility', just like there is a similarity/difference structure or a compression/expansion or filter/generation that can produce volatility, but iterations are simple to apply and highly descriptive of the structures they create, so are particularly useful to identify)
        - for example, solving the problem of 'regression' is solving the 'scaling/iteration problem of high variation structures (such as function structures like function types)' so that new units like new function types can replace iterations, and is similar to the problem of 'solving all variable unit interactions' (what count of 'unit wave' required/allowed to aggregate with count of 'unit exponential' aligned on some similarity, creates some output count of what unit structure) since multiplication is a scaling function (applying an iteration of some input) and adding is a coordination function (how do these multiplied "counts of function types" coordinate to form an "aggregation/stack"), so identifying all the 'scales/iterations of structures' that produce useful function types or useful function variables or useful function interactions is the index to compute (how can a wave and exponential function and an interval function interact in a real system, at what scales, to coordinate in forming an aggregation), similar to how multiplication is an embedding format applying different units ('x of x of x') so identifying similarities between embeddable as in stackable structures is another useful way to describe this problem
        - relatedly, 'when a new unit is yet to be identified' (by identifying a new iteration type) is the state when a 'combination of existing functions will have the most error' and the most volatility will occur
            - identifying the most random function that just barely avoids being describable as random is useful as a set of functions that can describe and approximate randomness by connecting it to volatility and other variables likely to produce almost-random functions, which simplify the problem of describing high variation functions by using 'volatility units' or 'randomness units' (and the variable interactions that create these) and connecting them with other function variables/types, as a useful way to simplify the uncertainty space between linear/random functions, and as a useful default sets to linearly describe complex systems
            - similarly, identifying the function types/interactions/structures (waves aggregated with exponential functions, aggregated with interval/grid functions, aggregated with random functions) that adjacently produce solution metrics like 'volatility' is useful to pre-filter the solution set
            - relatedly, identifying which variables are difficult to predict in a system by being very independent or very distant or otherwise interactive with many variables or supporting high variation (identifying the output of some high variation variable collision, in a system that allows previous collision outputs to interact, at some iteration count n) will identify the function types that havent been identified yet and is likely to identify useful directions of change as useful problems to solve
            - relatedly, identifying how a structure can be used to seem like its opposite (in a false way, like temporarily, or ignoring the adjacent states or a subset of variables) like how volatility units can be iterated to create a very different function type (like linear/random/wave) is useful to identify 'patterns of differences possible within a definition' as well as 'positions of function types in function fields/networks' which can be used to identify other useful positions of other useful functions types (not being describable/definable with other patterns/variables/types, similar to how primes occupy spaces in between rectangles/squares so their position can be determined by differentiating from or connecting rectangles/squares, indicating a new pattern/variable/type is required to describe the interim function between other definitions, and describing all of these new structures and their similarities in the uncertainty space being generally useful, 'identifying extensions/iterations/expansions of and interim structures between and new angles/compressions of definitions' being generally useful for 'identifying new variation')
            - relatedly, identifying randomness as being relevant to an increase in dimension (a 'square describing a data set shape' being a randomness structure compared to a 'line describing a data set shape') is useful for identifying uncertainty structures (an increase in dimension has likely occurred in an uncertainty structure, which makes finding a line in a square/cube/etc more difficult, which is a simple structure of an 'iteration' to reduce complexity with)
        - relatedly, identifying that a problem can only exist if another problem is not solved is useful to identify ways to 'connect these problems with overlaps' that can make progress with both in the set of problems
        - relatedly, identifying how a set of different structures like 'exponential stacks' and 'rectangular areas' can be created by a function (what change types can be created in what formats by a particular function, like x^2 or x^2 plus x, creating 'square or rectangular' areas in the 'area' format) is useful to identify, to identify metrics like 'how easily can this function generate any structure or extreme differences like randomness'
        - identifying 'functions that can create multiple interface structures' (like a function that can adjacently or simultaneously or otherwise similarly create a line and a circle) is a useful function type to identify and apply as default useful functions through this multi-functionality
        - identifying connections between variable interaction structures described by the 'approximations of functions' and the variable interaction structures described by the 'original functions' are useful to identify as a high variation variable that is likely to have some useful new similarity/difference variation, the structures described by approximations likely to overlap in some subset of variables in a way that reflects other useful 'differences in similarities', as a way of identifying the differences that can have an overlap in an approximation or other similarity

    - identify useful structures like different variables used to filter queries, like connections between 'different function types and function/definition variants and similarities and concepts' that cover reality and connections between 'specific concept networks' that fulfill useful functions like core interaction functions like 'reduce/distribute'
        - for example, 'explain' requires structures like 'alternate definitions' or 'variants of a structure' or 'examples of a structure' which are all connected to 'similarity'
        - therefore concepts like 'luck/randomness' are related to 'explain' by 'similarity', bc luck is 'adjacency of resources' (adjacency such as similarity, such as similar variants of a definition), so making a graph that implements luck (a graph that makes everything adjacent) is also a graph that can be used to explain anything in terms of anything else (using adjacent variants of a structure to explain it by describing its structure in a different system, given that explain is usually applied to concepts, and 'describing the structures or variants of a concept or its definition often explains it' similar to how 'identifying specific structures like examples' often explains it)
        - so 'apply luck to fulfill the explain function' is a way to connect different structures like 'randomness/similarity' in a specific and useful way (for the 'explain' function intent)
        - this is partly bc of the overlap between 'similarity' and 'simplicity' (with the exception of 'volatility' which makes some similarities complex), which makes randomness an orthogonal structure to similarity, these 'opposites-once-removed (opposite of randomness as in complexity being simplicity), across a non-1-to-1 mapping like similarity/simplicity' being useful to identify as different/orthogonal structures that are still similar enough to be relevant, and being likelier to cover more of reality than the original opposite set
        - identifying a 'way to use randomness to optimize a query' is always possible but not always adjacent, so identifying all the ways randomness can be useful by identifying a randomness network (randomness being useful after solution sets are very reduced, having already been filtered and similarized so that any random difference like any subset within that similar filtered solution set is useful, or when there is minimal info or when realistic simulations are required or when adjacency of resources is required or when generalization or other interface differences are required) is useful to connect to algorithms (algorithms occupying the space between concept and other interface networks like 'iteration networks', 'optimization networks', 'randomness networks', etc), which will make it more adjacent to apply randomness in algorithms bc the extensions of the randomness network will likely intersect/connect with other interface structures by default
            - connecting a query to either 'randomness or similarity' makes it clear how to connect it to its opposing structures (implementing 'organize' as a 'set of similarities (like a sort) to reduce randomness')
                - identifying structures with many 'opposing' structures (like abstractions/interfaces) is useful to identify structures that are useful by default in queries (the intent of queries being to connect problematic differences)
            - identifying functions that fulfill interface structures (interface functions like the 'most similar function across the most function types' and the 'most intersective function' and the 'most random function' and their overlaps) is useful as a set of default useful structures to connect in the math interface, which other structures are likely to be described by
            - identifying the structures like 'limits' of functions like 'describe/use' is similarly useful to identify, some of these functions contradicting and preventing the others (the 'use' function has to use different functions than the 'describe' function, or they cant evaluate each other independently in a way that could justify re-generating the other completely to be different after being found suboptimal, just like how 'explain' has to be applied regularly to make sure the other usages/functions can justify their processing, indicating theres a grid that queries should comply with, which is useful as a filter of queries)
            - the different ways to use randomness include 'distributing resources so theyre adjacent' and 'selecting a solution randomly from a very reduced set, after similarity between items in the set has already been established', which is why I connected randomness to explain, since explain uses 'variants of a definition/structure based on a similarity between variants, and identifying the problem of explaining a theft of my work as 'not possible to explain, no matter how many examples or variants are given, bc of the dependence involved, making any explanation invalid and not justifiable given the problems caused by it'
        - given the high variability of the 'explain' function, this indicates there is always a way to connect randomness/similarity to fulfill different functions/intents
        - relatedly, identifying structures that 'fulfill a definition but are so different that it may as well be inapplicable and invalidate that definition' are useful to identify, like implementations of an intent that are so different from useful implementations of that intent (as in having a high ratio of errors) that it may as well not be an implementation of that intent
        - whether its more useful to identify 'iteration/optimization/randomness' networks for standardization or whether its useful to apply differences in these formats (iteration networks, optimization directions, randomness limits) for maximal differentiation is likely to have an optimal structure of a connection between these different interface structures, as the more variable variant is selected with usage as being able to support more usage, where 'selecting a solution with usage after testing various usages' is a less optimal structure than 'deriving connections likely to be useful by applying insights on how connections should be derived'
        - similarly, connecting interfaces to interfaces in general is useful, such as how identifying that 'quantum connections' are similarities between different interface structures (semantic similarities like 'probability/cause/independence connections' since quantum connections have an extreme impact on probability/cause/independence as an opposing variable to other similarity variables like 'adjacency', so they may be applications of probability/cause/independence as a base of reality, rather than any adjacent similarity), indicate that there are other variants of similarities which will be identified in physics as 'bases of reality' (as in 'different ways to connect structures in reality'), and similarly identifying structures that occur frequently or with regularity (sufficient to be constant/connectible) are other possible bases of reality
        - identifying structures that 'implement relevant differences (like maximal differences)' are useful as a structure to filter solution sets (as they make filtering more trivial and are also more valuable structures to identify), similar to how identifying highly interactive structures like the 'most similar function to other function types' is useful, and identifying the 'most relevant differences in a solution set' are important 'filters to prioritize' (identifying the 'only relevantly different as in "good" usage' of a structure is useful to identify in a generally useless structure, which is possible by applying maximal differences and identifying which structures support them), as identifying these maximal differences in a solution set organized by some similarity is useful to be able to identify the generators of these similarities/differences (like the 'point on a causal network where these similarities/differences begin, overlap, and diverge'), such as 'applying enough differences to break powerful symmetries'
        - relatedly, identifying that iterations/grids are simpler to compute is useful, and enables identifying what is correct by which iterations/grids are not correct/applicable (such as how its possible to identify what grid doesnt apply bc its more adjacently verifiable from any point, and its possible to identify what iteration does not apply bc they interact with other structures like limits and intersections which are more verifiable, such as 'if everyone was using this function, this would not occur, so there isnt a grid where everyone is using that function') and similarly other useful structures can be identified by what is verifiable
        - 'identifying more abstract questions' like 'is it more true that there is a network/structure for every type of different format (like a density) of an interface structure, or that there are only structures that apply similarities/differences in their identified positions' is useful as a general problem-solving intent as a way to direct future interface queries
        - relatedly, there is a way to connect all interfaces to 'usefulness/meaning/relevance' (apply probability to create a useful probability structure like 'luck' as in 'distributed resources leading to adjacency to resources, making those resources likely to be identified on any given route' or 'distribute inputs to resources, making those resources likely to be generated' or 'distribute resources randomly within sufficiently small units for it to be approximately lucky for all positions, with equal probability of being anywhere within the unit', an example structure of usefulness) and a way to connect all interfaces to solution metrics (apply probability in the solution filter, as a 'high probability of identifying distributed resources within n steps')
            - relatedly, 'distribute resources' is a problem-solving intent bc of its connection to concepts like 'probability' and 'luck' and useful structures like 'resources' as well as its high variation variables like the 'distribute' function
            - identify these variables of how the interfaces can be a problem/solution structure are particularly useful to identify/differentiate/connect

    - identifying useful structures like 'optimals' that fulfill intents like 'organization' that can be used to filter interface queries as well as filter the set of problems to solve, a useful structure for fulfilling multiple problem-solving intents
        - for example, 'identifying optimals' (as generally useful targets) is useful for 'filtering/organizing problem-solving queries', as applying 'iterations of differences from optimals' is likely to create 'error' structures that 'connect optimals to adjacent/existing resources', for example identifying 'all the most useful values of spectrum variables and the network of spectrum variables and other useful structures' as a set of optimals to find integrations of, or specific optimals to connect to existing structures with differences, as opposed to applying problem-solving queries when specific problems are identified, instead identifying optimals and identifying all the problems connecting existing resources with those optimals and solving those specific connecting problems, or similarly solving related problems like the 'problem of connecting optimals' (so that when one is reached, the others are also reachable)
            - this is like deriving the question from the answer and identifying a network connecting questions/answers as well as identifying optimal routes between them and structures like 'types' of questions that create 'types' of answers and identifying which answers are important and organizing problem-solving around those important answers
        - these 'general optimals' are useful as 'specific directions (within uncertainty spaces between limits) to apply changes in', which are complementary with 'limits on change' as filters of interface queries
        - relatedly, irreversibilities are also relevant to time, as well as 'ratio of variation remaining' (entropy), not just variation, bc time requires a balance between variation/constants
            - irreversibilities create new differences that are required/adjacent, being a base for changes to develop on, and also change what is possible with the remaining variation, and various sets of irreversibilities can decrease other forms of time (including other irreversibilities/constants/variables) so can act as an opposing structure of time (leading to constant cascades) as well as enabling more time (being a useful base for changes), so 'identifying the interfaces that future people will need' is important to identify as quickly and as many as possible, as a general problem-solving intent that computers should be dedicated to (identifying the useful combinations of AI/computation/graphs that will enable the most variation)

    - identifying optimization opportunities using combinations (like 'structure-function sets', 'similarities', and 'connections to useful intents' and 'connections to implementation structures of those intents') which are useful as 'solution metric sets to connect and apply as filters of solutions'
        - for example, identifying 'opportunities' for useful connections/substitutions (like applying a neural network neuron for each data point) by identifying similarities (like the similarity between 'number of data points' and 'number of neurons') is a useful problem-solving intent, given that connections/substitutions are useful functions fulfilled by similarities so there is often an opportunity to identify these useful function fulfillments once those useful structures for those functions are identified as relevant/applicable, and similarly identifying useful functions fulfilled by other interface structures is useful to generate 'structure-function sets' that are likely to be useful across workflows, and identifying the reasons justifying applying that similarity (its useful to 'find connections between data points' in the regression problem space in general, so applying them as structures to connect in a neural network could be similarly useful with many connection variables like 'skipping a ratio of adjacent points' and 'maximizing intersectivity' and 'maximizing avoidance of intersections and avoidance of limits/ranges as a way to optimize for average connections') by applying interface structures and deriving useful intents and checking for a match with that similarity application
            - similarly, identifying the usefulness of an algorithm to "separate a 'probable solution area' into units like integer squares and identifying whether a data point or data point structure like data point ratio is in that unit and identifying the most useful units for regression intents and identifying the interactions between positive/negative units and identifying the most useful data point structure to apply as a metric (or set of these metrics)" is useful and possible by applying similarities to other useful structures like 'networks/grids'
        - relatedly, identifying 'connected intents' are useful to apply as default indexed structures which can be used once one of the intents in a set of connected intents is identified as useful, same for other connection sets that are useful and possible to pre-compute and apply as constants/defaults
        - relatedly, the implemenation of a general connection like the 'abstraction of math' as an 'application of abstractions to cover all math connections' as opposed to implemented as a 'generalization of math structures (to identify abstract info structures)' is useful as an example of 'maximal differences possible with the abstraction definition', which identifies the usefulness and possibility of a 'maximal difference-first workflow' (apply differences in interface definitions to generate maximally different intents to start solving a problem with to increase the probability of identifying a useful intent), the prioritization and sequencing of interface structures in a workflow being useful variables related to 'filtering' variables
            - for example, try to think of a problem that cant be formatted in a way that a 'ratio between relevant sequences/aggregations' cant be used to solve it - all problems can be solved with that structure when formatted a specific way, bc a ratio encapsulates a core difference that represents a problem definition (a problematic difference to resolve with a comparison between relevant variables containing a high degree of information, such as aggregations/abstractions/sequences), therefore this 'abstract ratio' which can be applied to resolve many different comparisons abstracts away the specific structures (the math) bc it can be used to connect all relevant structures likely to be problematically different (resolving all differences with one abstract structure)

    - identify useful structures like 'functions like "optimize" applicable to interface structures like usage structures like "implementations" such as "interface queries"' that can fulfill some problem-solving intent like 'reduce errors' for problem/solution intents like 'identify interface queries'
        - 'optimize' applied to 'implementation' as 'reducing errors' such as 'reducing cost of implementation' is useful as a problem-solving intent, given how valuable it is to make an existing solution less costly, even if the solution stays mostly the same, in cases where the cost of an expensive solution is the problem or an alternate problem to solve compared to finding new solutions, same for other errors in the problem space of identifying interface queries
            - at every point, applying 'optimize (to reduce costs of some function)' will likely help with some other intent if the optimization is new, so 'optimize to reduce new errors' is a useful function to apply regularly, so much so that it can be applied randomly and still likely improve an interface query
            - 'optimize' is 'solve problems by reducing errors, by creating differences to errors', whereas 'organize' is 'apply differences to create organized/similarity structures like definitions/sorts/networks/indexes', whereas 'apply paradoxes' is 'find the most extreme differences possible within some set of limits' and 'apply interfaces' is 'embed differences until no more are possible to embed, or until interface structures are reached again (like generating abtractions from specifications)', whereas 'isolate and re-combine' and 'generate/filter' are variants of 'apply similarities like combinations and differences like filters/sequences'
            - 'optimize implementation' is useful bc identifying low-cost structures are generally useful, 'low-cost' being an almost constant in interface query filters, this constant or almost constant being useful as a default structure
            - its also useful bc it can apply enough variation to solve the problem in other ways, just by reducing cost/error of some sub-intent in an existing interface query but also by applying the high variation intrinsic to 'reducing interface query cost' and 'reducing new differences' (an opposing intent to 'identify new variation' similar to how generate/filter and isolate/re-combine are useful opposing intents, which are useful to find for all problem-solving intents or useful intents), so generally 'reduce cost of interface queries' is useful as a general problem-solving intent
        - relatedly, identifying 'mixed-truth efficiency' structures as 'jokes' is useful to identify, as jokes can represent 'paradoxes' (extreme/opposite differences possible within the same definition) and other 'similarities with differences', outside the areas of truth and closer to the limits that indicate randomness in the uncertainty space in between 'linear functions and randomness', in the 'ridiculous' as in 'orthogonal in sensibility/reasonability' such as by connecting extremely independent structures
            - 'you couldnt be any smarter' is a double meaning possible within the definitions of 'could not', 'be', 'any', and 'smarter', having extreme opposite differences, creating high output differences with low input differences (efficiency)
        - relatedly, 'linearized randomness' is possible with a 'maximal difference network where all differences are adjacent', which can be used to find the positions that would adjacently create randomness, or create a network where every point or regular points are random, which should be integrated into the 'uncertainty space' network, to identify new limits than randomness (like identifying randomness-maximizing structures, etc)
        - relatedly, identifying that a 'capacity/limit for addiction' is possible is useful to identify as an interface structure of 'addiction' in the 'addiction' problem space and useful to apply by 'fulfilling the addiction capacity with positive addictions like to 'exercise/vegetables/learning' (so that no additional negative addictions can be added)', similar to how applying addiction (a problem of 'over-using' applied to 'useless' structures) with useful structures like 'vegetables' (over-using vegetables likely wouldnt be harmful as vegetables increase self-regulation and health) to 'over-use the useful structures' is possible to identify by "differentiating/isolating the variables and re-combining them in useful ways"
        - relatedly, 'applying "limits" like requirements/simplifications as a way to make some differences more obvious' is useful as an alternative to 'applying "extremes" to magnify changes to make them more obvious' and 'apply separations/isolations/filters/subsets to make differences more obvious', 'change differences to make them more obvious' being a generally useful problem-solving intent

    - identify useful structures like adjacent structures to useful structures that create other useful structures like connections to 'probable available input information' as well as 'connections between equivalent meaning structures'
        - for example, given that some ratio of sequences (such as when determining whether some sequence converges faster than another to a useful value) might be useful to solve some problem, the inputs that create the changes describable with that ratio (like specific values that represent intersections or stacks of interface structures which are likely to create convergence, like hyperbolic functions) are useful to identify and apply as another structure to connect to identify adjacent structures like the ratio, to determine which change structures are likely to be useful to connect, likely to create a comparable value in some metric like an aggregation/iteration, and likely to be possible to connect with a ratio
        - relatedly, identifying equivalent structures of meaning is useful, such as how 'solution metrics are useful to optimize for even when not being evaluated' because of the probability that side effects of not optimizing when not being evaluated will be iterated and/or will intersect with other structures related to other evaluations (the 'fulfillment of the solution metric when being evaluated' is similarly meaningful as 'fulfillment of the solution metric when not being evaluated' because an 'iteration' can create an 'equivalence in meaning between an unmeasured error and a measured success', however indirectly, as an unmeasured error can create cascading errors that impact the next evaluation), so that multiple equivalent structures of meaning are fulfilled rather than selecting a subset, given how variables are rarely completely unconnectible and therefore a worst case scenario of unmeasured errors creating error cascades must be considered, being possibly equally meaningful
        - relatedly, as a prioritization optimization, identifying different filters of info is related to identifying different complementary sets of info, which make different info trivial to identify (these being different perspectives/filters to apply to make different info obvious), these filters being useful to identify first in new systems to identify what info is missing and obvious to derive position of filters like assumption sets
        - relatedly, identifying interface structures like 'variables' of useful formats like 'graphs' (like position/distance/parameterization) is useful, and relatedly, identifying similarity types between graphs (like manifolds of graphs) is useful, and applying these for adjacent intents ('applying variables to create variation in graphs') is useful (such as by 'identifying graph changes that are possible and filtering these for usefulness') and similarly applying interface structures to graphs (such as alternates or alternating structures like waves to create 'grids within graphs' like alternating different node types, from a uniform graph of one node type, by applying different similarity/difference types, like changing one structure in a graph and changing structures in a pattern and mixing structures and distributing those mixes until its a grid or has other patterns, 'changing one structure' or 'changing structures to a pattern like alternating' being different from standard changes that change every node like applying a format/position change to indicate some difference in the graph)
        - 'definitive' differences from interfaces (like 'colors', which are ridiculous to call a 'reality-covering variable' or an 'abstract variable' or an 'interface' despite being a useful indicator of a subset of light and therefore a subset of differences, since light is an interface) as useful 'alternating structures mimicking query patterns like generate/filter alternations' (since there is frequently an adjacent structure that interacts with color given its high frequency as an input and high variation, which doesnt form a grid exactly but definitely follows patterns of variation if not alternation patterns), compared to different variables like 'positive/negative' which definitely represent core problem-solving structures like 'combine/reduce' so they are definitely useful to apply as interfaces, as opposed to the 'non-defining subset of a specific interface' that color represents and therefore is not equivalent to an interface, but is still useful as a different structure than a field covering reality
            - relatedly, identifying 'requirements of solution metrics' is useful, such as how 'minimizing negative side effects is not equivalent to maximizing positive side effects' and 'both need to be applied in combination in order to be applicable as a good solution metric'
        - 'coordinating useful structures like coordinating vertexes/cross-interface/combination structuures' are useful to connect using similarity/difference structures as default interface query components/bases/inputs (like the 'reason why a structure is useful for some intent/context' and the 'reason why a structure is useful for some different intent/context', based on a similarity of the 'reason/structure' cross-interface structure)
        - identifying 'connections between networks of truth/similarity indexes' is useful to identify similarly complex structures (truth indexes being useful to identify, as 'filters' that make truth structures obvious are useful to identify, like how some filters make truth structures like 'temporary truths' and 'illusory truths' and 'forced/computed truths' and 'default/current truths' and 'probable/future truths' obvious, where structures that seem true can be true/false in various ways since 'subsets of solution metrics' that make some connection seem true dont contain enough information to reflect the whole truth, so these subsets will have definite error structures of 'missing/incomplete info' that can invalidate the connection, and the overlaps between these filters/inputs/subsets of truth structures reflects a 'network of truth indexes' that is useful to connect to corresponding structures on other interfaces like a 'network of similarity indexes')
            - relatedly, identifying that a 'contradiction' (applicable as a 'filter of generated connections') can have different interface structure forms like being completely contradicting, definitively contradicting, required to contradict the original statement, exactly opposite, partly contradicting, contradiction of its uniqueness as in 'alternate', contradiction by being 'more true', contradiction by being "limiting of the original statement's truth", etc
        - relatedly, identifying new variation (as change of change) is useful as an extreme variation source, which is useful as a general problem-solving intent (find the most extreme change such as a change of change like new variation as a useful structure like a variation source, similar to how its useful to identify the most extreme abstractions, as in the most abstract abstractions, like interface variables, and similarly its useful to find the opposites of extreme changes, as in the units of interfaces and the overlaps of these interface variables, overlaps where variation occurs as equivalent/similar alternatives)
            - relatedly, connecting interface structures to core intents like 'identify a useful difference like an intra-spectrum variant (like a specific variant, an example) of some concept or function' which can be specified by 'applying a specific context (which is in a different position than the example, as in around it, and doesnt prevent the example and fulfills a requirement of the example)' ('an abstraction applied in a specific context creates a specific abstraction variant'), and additionally 'applying changes (to the abstraction, in that context) to create interactivity' is further useful for the same intent, as specificity results from interactivity, interactivity acting as a filter
            - these intents like 'identify new/variable variation' and 'identify intra-spectrum variation' are useful and useful to identify variants of, bc these are abstract structures which havent been solved for yet, so finding new connections of them is still useful as a substitute for solving other problems (identifying new variables will likely help solve other problems in a problem space), but which are highly determining of problems/solutions, given their interactivity with high variation variables like interfaces
            - 'find a specific example' is a particularly unsolved problem bc connection structures like 'equivalence between "every possibility" and "required"' arent abstracted and applied manually unless the related perspective has been applied recently or otherwise is artificially likely to be used, so 'find a specific example of a required structure' (which wouldnt adjacently lead to an answer like 'covering every possibility' without recently identifying different definitions of 'required' or recently using 'every' instead of 'required', same for 'default', same for other forms of adjacence than 'recent' like 'simple') 'find a specific example' being a 'difficult direction' for an interface query to implement structures in or in fulfillment of, these optimization structures being useful to identify in networks of interface query components/queries
            - relatedly, identifying useful new intents is related to identifying new variation, which is possible by 'identifying different connections possible within a set of definitions' and 'applying differences across these variants where they are not required (applying an intent relevant to a variant, to the original)', for example identifying an 'average metric of some set of factors having an attribute like prime' and identifying an 'average metric of some set of usages of those factors having that same attribute like prime', this average metric not being guaranteed to be useful when applied in different structures but is useful as a possible source of variation'

    - identifying sequences of problem-solving is useful as a way to speed up current and future time, by applying 'variation sources' as a way to identify where problem-solving will go, and how to connect those future intents with current intents through integrating these future intents into current interface queries
        - for example, given that most medium-complexity problems are solvable with relatively simple structures like 'identify the ratio between two relevant differences that contain high variation/information (like relevant abstractions/sequences/aggregations/averages/iterations/embeddings)' or 'find a position on a network/plane/grid in relation to other structures like a plane of errors (which reduces errors to a simple set of variables so that any new error can be mapped into this plane and identified in its similarity to other errors, simplifying variables of errors like "difference from useful intents")', so that the error-similar structure can be identified and the solution-similar structure can be applied for some intent, other problems after this set of problems will involve 'optimizing iterations to avoid creating relevant differences to compare/filter' and 'optimizing planes so that errors are trivial to identify and avoid (like by finding different bases that make errors more trivial to identify)', to avoid creating these medium-complexity problems in the first place
        - identifying problem-solving sequences (like where problem-solving will go next, based on where the variation is) is useful for directing the design of interface queries to solve medium-complexity problems now
        - once its known that 'optimizing planes of solutions/errors' and 'optimizing iterated structures to maximize useful differences' and related intents for similar problem-solving structures are known, current interface queries can apply this as a solution metric to help fulfill those future intents
        - relatedly, identifying cases when a function (like a neural network) is useful is a matter of identifying its limitations/functions (a neural network is useful when "there is likely to be an identifiable pattern with additional hidden variation that requires more scaling/iteration than people can do quickly to identify, and the pattern is partly identified before applying the neural network, such as a 'description of its complexity/variation' being identified beforehand, to identify a neural network as being capable of identifying the pattern in the data")
            - relatedly, other ways to generate useful function networks can be identified and optimized in a neural network, given that there is some pattern to "identifying a useful similarity (like an abstract similarity), applying changes to it to identify other similarities, and iterating this process" (to identify useful function networks that can probably be used as neural networks to solve most problems by default when trivially changed to change the angle that queries are applied in, etc), similar to how interfaces seem to be other structures like filters when a focus is applied to a subset of an interface, so interfaces make good default networks to connect variables with
            - similarly, applying interface structures varying on useful abstract structures like 'relevant differences' such as how a 'function and its contradictions (filters of that function indicating its not applicable)' are useful to connect in neural networks, as a set of pre-filtered filters to apply when filtering functions, given the identified usefulness of these structures and the probability of additional variation being possible/useful to identify
            - similarly, identifying different differences to check similarities for interactivity with is useful (as opposed to connecting them to already defined/identified relevant differences), given that these similarity/difference sets are useful for identifying patterns in, similar to how applying a structure in its defined incorrect/suboptimal position is useful for identifying its limits/functions/definition
            - relatedly, identifying the structures that produce the most variation like 'connections between high variation variables' and 'abstractions' and 'combinations of multiple independent variables' are useful to identify and apply to describe differences supported by similarities, given that these components all fulfill a 'difference (like a specification) supported by a similarity (like a type or intent or description/average or base or range/limit of variation, around which variation occurs)', so combining these components tends to be higher variation, and similarly other structures which create 'exponential change or other change types with few inputs and high outputs' are similarly good at producing more variation than a simple combination like a sum
            - relatedly, connecting useful structures commonly found in solutions like averages (similarities), thresholds (filters), ratios (comparisons) is useful to identify how those structures will become other structures to identify other problems adjacently solvable by those structures, and identify difference dynamics given the connection of these structures to differences (ratios being useful to identify between relevant differences, thresholds being comparisons to a base that are applied as filters to differentiate some subsets in a set, averages/overlaps/intersections indicating similarities to identify similarity indexes which can also differentiate through similarizing/standardizing)
            - relatedly, identifying 'interface structures' of similarities like 'intersections of similarities' to identify adjacent structures (connections, angles) to those structures (intersections) is useful and possible, by arranging similarities/connections in different positions/angles until they intersect or encounter other structures like barriers or limits (different from a standard network graph of identified rules, where differences are applied in the connections until other identified structures are identified by applying changes to the differently organized similarities, indicating the graph is good at generating other identified structures, such as by selecting a subset of connections/similarities to organize in a subset of different ways at a subset of different starting points and angles until some combination is successful at generating other interface structures more adjacently than other subsets, and then connecting those useful subsets as equivalent alternates until proven otherwise)
            - relatedly, identifying a specific structure (like the specific connection that solves some problem) can be done by applying changes on some other interface (like applying changes on the intent interface), given that existing structures probably arent sufficient without additional differences (existing intents wont find that specific structure, so identify new intents that will make it more adjacent to find, or identify new types of specification on the abstract/specific interface or new difference types on the similarity/difference interface, or identify new differences that might be relevant, as a default set of new structures to compare/connect)
        - relatedly, identifying structures that are not typically useful in the 'thinking' problem space (simple thinking such as 'blood flow between existing neurons', which is only useful if those neurons can solve every problem like interfaces and if the solution is a simple connection possible with blood flow) and those that are typically useful (like 'synchronicity created by waves that expand a structure like a neuron until the structures are trivially connectible or make some difference trivial to identify', and other structures like 'adding new neurons between/around existing neurons to contain new variation of new connections identified between neurons' and 'new connection functions created a new interaction layer between neurons, incentivizing changing those neurons to component structures on the new interaction level and incentivizing different connections/neurons as default', which have some degree of change of the structure like change a function and change the neuron info and change the neuron structure, similar to a vertex of changes that when applied creates a useful difference like a rotation, as applying a 'similar change rate connected to the same structures' is like 'identifying a spiral that connects all variables') are useful to identify possible new workflow variables like 'frequency' (related to waves) applied to workflow structures like 'evaluation of metrics', since variation is allowed between evaluations where they are held constant to be measured, similar to some workflows that apply and then filter variation, so applying 'frequency' to fulfill possibly useful intents like 'synchronize evaluations' is useful to filter workflows

    - identifying connections between structures that are possible with other structures (connecting generators to solution metrics is possible and useful) is useful to identify as an 'optimization opportunity' (to create connections where there were none before in a useful set of structures to connect), 'identifying and solving for optimization opportunities' being a general problem-solving intent
        - for example, identifying solution metric networks as outer layers created by some core set of structures is useful to identify as an info structure that will identify important/useful structures like 'generators of solution metric variables' such as 'accuracy', 'generalizability', 'linearizability', 'sensitivity', 'stability', etc, which would identify their common components/inputs/generators like 'interface structures of interface structures', since solution metrics are often iterated interface structures that contain high variation, like some specific type of 'input/output connection' like 'volatility', and other solution metrics can be generated by variants of those inputs (identifying different types of input/output connections across increasingly abstract functions) and their common generators can be identified as 'solution structures to generate structures having those solution metrics' (which would solve the problem of 'identifying the interface structures that can always fulfill some set of solution metrics') as a general problem-solving structure, and relatedly identifying structures that fulfill the most solution metrics is trivial once these generators and connections are identified (where this general problem-solving generator/solution metric connection network is likely to still have some ratio of abstraction rather than connecting some specific variable set, but is complete enough to describe most variable interactions specifically)
        - similarly, identifying 'descriptions of solution metrics' that connect to other structures like specific examples is useful as a 'connection between high variation variables' that would make the connections to the solution metric variable usable as 'interface queries or their components'
        - the 'generator' connections and the 'description' connections may overlap, but the point is that these are both different structures that accomplish the same intent, which is connecting solution metrics to other structures (which if it can be completed, would solve all problems by definition)
        - similarly, organizing solution metrics and fulfilling other problem-solving functions for solution metrics like reduce/distribute/differentiate are similarly useful as alternate 'query components/queries' (or bases/limits or other structures of them), to indicate a default set of useful 'query components/queries' or structures of them

    - identifying useful structures like 'variation sources' such as 'graphs of interface structures of alternate routes' that are likely to be useful across problem-solving intents like 'identify new variation' and identifying the connections to fulfill those intents like 'identify the highest variation reduced structure in that variation source' ('identify variation source' -> 'identify a useful structure (like the highest variation reduced structure) in that variation source' -> 'identify new variation'), where the new variation might be a new 'difference in a similarity' reflecting the 'variation in a reduced structure (the same core set)' such as 'maximally different subsets of similarity indexes'
        - for example, identifying 'maximally different subsets of similarity indexes' is a useful set to identify that is possible once the similarity indexes are identified, which is useful for intents like 'identifying new variation' and 'connecting independent variables'
        - identifying the 'variables of alternate routes connecting the same structures' is what identifies the usefulness of this structure of 'maximally different subsets of similarity indexes', identifying interface variables like connectors across sequences or alternate routes ('probabilities', 'interactivities', 'similarities', 'patterns', 'averages/bases'), differentiators of alternate routes ('filters', 'limits'), differences between alternate routes or positions in sequences ('maximal differences'), and creators of alternate routes ('generators') as useful to create and differentiate the 'set of alternate routes', where the most useful structure in that set would be the most reduced structure (such as a subset, like 'maximal differences') that covered the most variables ('variation' being highly completely described by 'similarity indexes'), where different but similarly maximally covering 'subsets of similarities' would be useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying filters of inputs/variables/components/generators of abstract info structures (like 'filters' to find relevant sequences to find a ratio to compare or 'filters' to find relevant values to compare like convergent values) are useful to identify inputs/variables/components/generators of, such as how 'high variation variables' in a sequence set is likelier to be relevant to compare than other variables and how 'interface values' (as in 'stacked change types') of those high variation variables like 'values overlapping with limits (like convergences)' are likelier to be relevant to comparisons, as these values contain higher ratios of information than other values
        - relatedly, to connect useful workflow intents like problem-solving intents and core interaction functions of workflows, 'identify new variation' is likely to be generally relevant across interfaces (new variables are likely to also create/be new abstractions, new causes, new functions, new interfaces, new similarities, etc) and vice versa, which is why its a problem-solving intent, just like 'identify new connections' is generally relevant and same for identifying other new interface structures or new iterations of interface structures like 'new positions of interface structures', just like 'fitting variables to identified variable interactions' is generally relevant as a complementary intent of 'identify new variation', as variation is more useful when connected/standardized to other variation, and similarly 'identify remaining/complementary variation (such as variation not covered by some variable set)' is useful in general as a specific variant of 'identify new variation' (the remaining variation in a system not already identified but determined by identification of some limit on variation, like points not explained by a function as complementary to that function's variables, forming a complete set of variables describing the points), and other interface structures of this intent (like 'identify new errors', 'identify variation sources', 'identify generators of variation sources') can create other general problem-solving intents by fulfilling variants of the 'filter variables' cross-interface structure which encapsulates the 'generate/filter' vertex, related to how 'specifying abstractions' encapsulates the 'abstract/specific' vertex and is a generator of problem-solving intents, and same for their interface structures like opposites ('change filters' and 'abstract specifications'), similar to the other spectrum variables like 'un/certainty' (as in 'vary constants as assumptions or averages or specifications', variables being useful for any of those structures, and 'specify variables as constants or optimizations', a specific variable value being useful for either structure) and other useful structures like 'embeddings' ('generate generators') and other cross-interface structures (like 'structure-function' as in 'structure a set of useful functions') and interfaces like 'organize' (organize as in 'identify structures (like networks) of structures')
        - relatedly, identifying 'requirement' as a highly useful structure on the useful 'spectrum' variable (as there is a spectrum and similar format of every interface variable) is useful, where other structures on the spectrum including 'meaning' structures like usages/definitions/implementations and 'relevance' structures like similarities/differences, solutions/errors, and abstract/specific connections as similarly useful, etc, a spectrum that provides a ranking/sort to avoid filtering the list of structures to apply (applying more useful structures by default as a default subset pre-filtered by the sorted ranking of the spectrum and the count/ratio n to pair it with to create the subset, this 'spectrum implementing a sort, combined with a ratio/count' being a useful adjacent interactive useful structure to apply as a component)
            - relatedly, as mentioned elsewhere, identifying 'required interface structures' (and other iterated applications of interface structures that are useful for solving problems) to solve a problem, like 'required info', 'required format', 'required definitions', 'required assumptions', 'required connections/filters', 'required probabilities', 'required causes', etc (similar to identifying probable variation and variation required and variation position) is useful as a general problem-solving intent (identifying abstract differences/causes/structures, identifying potential causes/limits/iterations, etc)
            - relatedly, fitting structures/requirements like identifying 'incomplete' structures to apply as 'components' is useful to apply with 'similarity indexes' across useful sets to connect like 'structures/requirements'
            - relatedly, identifying 'infrequently used' interface structures like 'iterated requirements' is useful to apply as a 'source/base of variation' or as an 'error/limit to avoid'
            - relatedly, identifying connections between bases/limits (similarities and limits on differences in that similarity) are useful to apply as 'default connection structures between structures having these known types (known bases/limits)' which are a common type to have a requirement to connect
        - relatedly, 'identifying non-trivial structures to connect (like filter/spectrum or network/spectrum)' is useful as a more useful problem to solve than other problems, as a spectrum implementing a filter (by incrementing some variable like 'independence') is unlikely except where the unit represents some high variation base like a 'concept' (like 'degree of power' or 'ratio of variation' or 'relative independence') or a 'number of randomly selected interface structures or filter structures like "loops/indexes/required equivalences" used to create the filter, or number of input variables from some variable set used by the filter' where every incrementation of the unit creates a usable filter, and where the spectrum values align with some other relevant structure (like how the high usefulness value aligns with requirements like a 'simple subset of defaults to select') thereby making the spectrum a useful format to identify for that filter, where the filter can have a variable with structures other than 'simple opposites (like two extremes on a spectrum)', meaning the filter's determining 'inputs/components like indexes/loops/equivalences' would be representable as a 'spectrum set, variables within spectrums, or connections between spectrums' to make filtering more trivial by organizing some filter components/inputs with pre-filters (sorts or other organizational formats)
            - this structure is useful to connect to the 'set of alternate routes between structures' and 'network of interface spectrum variables' which are relevant to this 'standardized spectrum network creating most filters'
        - as an example of a problem solved by a simple structure like a ratio, a general set of intents in a 'justice algorithm' would include a ratio between stacks of structures like resources of opposing sides in the conflict, where the problem to solve is distributing resources according to the fair ratio given the costs/benefits to society posed by both opposing sides, the problem created by the assumption that the 'existing distribution' is unfair and needs to be corrected, given some resource distribution that is not equal to this fair ratio (identifying that a 'structure which should be equal (to some ratio in this case)' is not equal to that, as a way to identify the problem automatically)
            - 1. determine fair ratio of resources according to costs/benefits to society of both sides of the conflict
            - 2. count resources
            - 3. determine resources that fulfill the fair ratio
            - 4. check if this resource distribution will harm society in some way or if it will get consensus (this is the part where AI can add a lot of value in generating good suggestions by handling many variables at once, since this is trillions of variables and the idea of 'harm to society' is not well-defined and frequently involves any sort of change)
            - 5. distribute resources as closely to the fair ratio as will avoid harming society
            - 6. then to correct the problem of the 'overly high ratio of crimes compared to non-harmful acts', algorithms to optimize group dynamics, algorithms to warn people about risks/negative side effects of decisions to help them make better decisions and algorithms to help scammers make money without exploiting people and algorithms to separate people who always fight and algorithms to organize people in cities to maximize the probability that there will be jobs for everyone (distributing people with different skills so they have something to sell each other) while also fulfilling as many other solution metrics as possible (minimizing commutes/pollution), algorithms to identify low-cost resource position changes to reduce other costs (distributing vitamin d, baking soda, herbs, pollution filters where the cancer rates are highest), etc
        - relatedly, the problem of 'identifying the specific structure (ratio) to find the correct value of' is a complementary component of the problem-solving query (complementary to the problem of 'identifying the correct specific ratio' and the problem of 'applying/implementing that ratio'), so applying this as a general query is useful ('find a solution structure, find the specific structure that is optimal, and find a way to use it')
            - the problem of 'identifying the specific structure (like a ratio) that solves the justice problem' is a matter of identifying the 'differences to correct' to increase the 'justice distribution' metric (identifying the 'injustices to correct'), meaning identify the structures related to the problem structure (the differences that create or are 'injustice' structures, as the distribution of the 'opposite of justice' as in 'injustice' is the problem)
            - so identifying that 'there is a ratio that can solve the justice problem' is possible when its identified that 'there is a ratio that is causing the problem or is the problem' (the high ratio of 'distribution of injustice, compared to justice'), which is frequently the case with abstract structures that contain a high ratio of information/variation like 'justice distribution or inequality distribution'
            - a 'ratio of a value representing high variation variables (like abstractions/interfaces/aggregated/average variables)' is likely to be incorrect bc these are complex values to identify/change for existing functions
            - this is solvable once a problem of identifying 'relevant differences' (the differences that are important in causing a problem), which may have a simple format (like a 'ratio or position on a plane/network to optimize') is solved
            - the ratio isnt the only structure involved (a 'sequence of distributions to implement the correction to the ratio' is the next structure required to implement the solution to the problem of 'identifying the specific correct ratio value', which is the solution structure to the complementary problem of 'applying/implementing the solution')
            - 'specific ratios that solve most problems' are ratios involving high variation variables that are also solution metrics like 'accuracy' (the 'ratio of truth/falsehood'), so other ratios or other simple structures of interface structures are useful as possible solution metrics to optimize for, and variants of the 'ratio between truth/falsehood' such as other relevant interface differences like differences between 'vertexes/spectrum variable values'
        - relatedly, the reason why an algorithm using interface structures is not 'too general to be useful, since interface structures are abstract enough to cover all of reality' is that some reality positions reflect 'some interface structures more than others' and therefore 'their connections have different value for different intents than other combinations/connections' and 'reality-covering' doesnt mean 'every useful variant of interface structures exists at every point in reality' and not every connection/usage of a structure at a position will have the same meaning bc positions differ in other metrics (this is the same reason that every possible structure can be used for every possible intent, but some structures are more adjacent to specific intents)
        - relatedly, 'abstractions' arent just 'types' bc abstractions have specific variables/functions like 'covering reality' (they are a 'type' of structure though), and also their structure changes with changes in variation in systems where they occur (so they can mostly only be defined by defining more specific abstractions or similarly their differences to other similarly abstract abstractions), bc they have enough variation to do so, being based on a general similarity, but they are related to types in that they are a 'set of variables', but 'abstractions' are also good general structures to solve problems with and base other changes on (justifying the connection to interfaces/filters/independent variables/systems, etc), where 'sequences of increasingly high variation filters' are useful as 'alternate timelines' (since time moves in the direction of higher-supported uncertainty/variation)

    - identifying useful structures like 'maximal differences from similarities' (like simple functions that create differences where similarities would be probable or otherwise expected) is useful to identify new structures to apply as new workflow components and new variables
        - while identifying structures of power (a 'suboptimal implementation' of power or 'absolute' power or 'suboptimal usage' of power are interface structures of power), the usefulness of standardizing to a more common concept occurred to me (abstraction) and identifying the interactions of these and the structures like limits of those interactions was adjacent at that point
        - the 'limit' of the interaction between different interface structures like 'abstraction' and 'power' is an interface structure (limit) of a cross-interface structure (the set of abstraction/power)
        - identifying these structures are useful to identify structure usefulness-switching functions (when some set has become less useful)
        - for example, power is less connected to specificity than abstraction (specificity is orthogonal to power), bc it takes more steps to reach it than abstraction (specificity -> constants -> stability -> power, as opposed to abstraction -> multi-functional/reality-covering variables -> powerful variables)
        - identifying these 'relatively more distant structures' is useful for determining directions/structures to find structures like limits of the interactions (limits as in 'what structures do power/abstraction not cover')
        - identifying structures that are unexpected, such as how an orthogonal variable to power (specificity) is not similarly different as the opposite of that variable (abstraction), are similarly useful to identify (what functions could apply bc of some similarity like a simple opposite on a spectrum but dont apply) and apply as new default components on the new interaction level created by those new structures, similar to how identifying that a spectrum variable can also be a cycle (like how some abstraction can be so abstract that it becomes specific, as in leaving only one remaining specific variable, having removed the other variables to create the more abstract form)
            - similarly, identifying similarities like 'abstractions without removing variables (such as only listing variable sets and their ranges/distributions, rather than specific values in those ranges/distributions)' and 'abstractions by removing variables (generalizing trivial specific embedded changes away or standardizing common bases away)' and other implementations of the 'abstraction' function that 'remove different variables like specifications or subsets' are useful to identify (similar to how identifying 'specific indexes of specific structures implementing some concept/function' which can be applied instead of 'applying the function itself' is useful), where identifying structures that still contain a high ratio of information when abstracted (interfaces, concepts, fields) is useful
        - relatedly, abstract concepts have related workflows that are useful, like how 'balance' is useful to 'identify connecting differences' as a useful function or how applying balance is useful to 'fulfill organization intents (like sort)', or how 'power' is useful to 'identify new variables' and 'identify stable variables'
        - why do I call structures like 'ratios of relevant sequences' the 'abstraction of math'? bc this structure 'ratios of relevant sequences' is so general that it can be used to solve most problems once those problems are formatted in such a way that a 'ratio of relevant sequences' is the important similarity/difference to resolve by identifying the ratio at some threshold, even though these structures like 'ratios of relevant sequences' are technically math structures, as all structures could be formatted as given that structure (geometry) is a field of math, so the 'abstraction of math' uses math, but they have so little structure that the ratio of math (as geometric structures) is relatively trivial compared to semantic functionality (the meaning achieved by the geometric structures, which is a solution format 'ratio of sequences' to solve most problems, 'finding this structure in that format' (finding the ratios comparing the sequences found to be relevant) being the new problem to solve once standardized to that format)
            - relatedly, more abstract problem-solving structures include 'ratios of abstract concepts like power/balance' which are powerful in that they identify a position on a graph of graphs of the abstract network (a specific ratio of power/balance representing for example a 'similarity/angle between them' or an 'indication of the net/emergent/aggregate difference between power/balance structures' is a reference to a 'set of abstract network variants' that allow that ratio), and through identifying this position or subset of variants, identify a high ratio of info about reality
            - relatedly, other fields of math (algebra) map to other abstractions and interface structures (function/variable networks, function/variable equivalences), just like core variables of math (direction, position, distance, sequence) map to interfaces (perspective, meaning, change, cause), and these fields can be connected in useful ways for interface analysis, identifying for example that 'geometry is an expansion/application/iteration/specification of algebra, as it identifies higher dimensional, specific structures (having many alternatives and containing more specific information bc of the expansion involved into the set of all examples fulfilling the algebraic equivalence as well as the repetition involved in creating geometric structures), specific structures that are associated with function/variable equivalences, in various systems/spaces' and 'algebra reflects set theory (what functions interact reflects what sets of numbers interact)' and 'set theory reflects number types/classes (what sets of numbers interact reflects what number types interact)', these 'equivalences/mappings/reflections' between math structures like 'math fields' being useful to identify and apply in interface queries where 'equivalences/mappings/reflections' are required and involve some specific math structure in the set/sequence of math structures like 'math fields', where 'math fields' reflect an independent set of variables in a format that reflects some ratio of reality similar to interfaces, where 'interface structures that connect math fields' are useful to identify and apply as 'abstract info structures' or 'problem-solving structures' (that connect every difference)

    - identifying useful structures like useful variants of useful problem-solving 'comparison' structures to resolve problems formatted as 'identifying similarities/differences between relevant structures'
        - for example, a 'ratio of relevant sequences' (comparing one high variation attribute by its relative scalar value) has related structures like a 'vertex (comparing a connection point between two perspectives)' and a 'position on a spectrum (where is the position compared to the extremes or midpoint of the spectrum)' and a 'filter set that identifies relevant similarities to compare' which are all variants of the original structure that help with various related intents that help with comparisons/differentiations like 'identify limits' (by identifying position on a spectrum relevant to extremes), and similarly identifying other structures like 'extensions' of comparisons that involve finding a simple structure like a 'scalar comparison of some summary (high variation) variable' like 'identifying different possible matrices/sets/sequences of scalars representing different high variation variables (like abstractions) and identify their common solutions' (their common solutions representing 'overlaps between similarity indexes')
        - similarly, 'identifying other useful comparisons between "relevant/similar but different" structures' is useful as a default set of problem-solving structures (like applied as a problem-solving intent or default interface query component)

    - identifying useful structures like 'interface structures of interface structures' that are highly useful (as in 'determining') and 'connections between similarities in structures' (like similarities in extremes in 'variation' and 'determination')
        - interface structures of independence like 'irrelevant' independence as in arbitrary, indirect, non-interactive structures, and 'general' independence (such as 'sufficient difference' as to be equal to 'orthogonal as in independent in some high ratio of variable interactions', which indicates an interim space between 'irrelevant/absolute independence' and 'direct dependence' containing 'relevant independence such as abstractions/interfaces'), independent variables being useful for resolving differences in general, and this space being useful for overlapping with other 'uncertainty spaces'
            - identifying independence on some graph like an interface graph where different interfaces are represented as 'maximally different directions'
        - identifying the 'useful differences in a problem' like 'abstraction' being useful to resolve the useful difference of 'adding missing info' in an 'overly-specific' function, where the problem is 'connecting extremes like specific/abstract to resolve missing info of over-specificity', and where an opposite problem would be 'resolving missing info of over-abstraction by adding specifying variables', and similarly finding other variants of the problem that are useful to connect/oppose
            - similarly, identifying 'generate/filter' as having useful differences in adding/removing dimensions is useful, as 'generate' is usable to increase dimensions to fit a requirement like 'separable by some structure, like an angle or line', as 'generate' is usable to 'pre-filter' a set so that a 'simple filter (like a position/line/angle)' can be more useful, these 'structures that make other useful structures like simple structures more useful' being useful to apply in combination to fulfill common intents like 'filter' ('functions to generate increases in differences' are useful in that they make simple filters like 'lines' more useful, which are useful to connect cross-interface structures like 'differences/simplicity'), so 'identifying simple filters and then identifying the differences required to make them useful' is an intent to identify useful problem-solving structures like 'functions to generate increases in differences between relevant/similar structures'
            - relatedly, 'pre-filtering a set by selecting a subset of probably useful structures in a simple function (like random)' and then 'changing that subset into the solution to find its distance from the solution, and find its position on some graph, then finding a more optimal graph to connect problems/solutions on' is another set of intents that can replace 'generate/filter'
            - relatedly, 'identifying useful sorts to invalidate filters (like identifying/opposing the most extreme errors first)' is another intent that can replace other filters and possibly invalidate filter intents completely, a useful sort reducing the problem to 'identifying a probable solution area' or 'identify an average' rather than 'filtering to one solution'
            - relatedly, finding 'graphs where a point/line/angle can solve the problem (where a point/line/angle can filter/connect/reduce)' is a matter of finding 'graphs where high variation variables (like problems/concepts) are adjacently connectible' like 'maps between complex systems' and 'maps between interfaces' and 'maps between concepts', and similarly identifying point/line/angles that have multiple functions like 'filter/connect/reduce' are useful to pre-filter the problem space
        - identifying 'specific maximally different structures in a set' (like the 'most useful as in different sequences in a set') is an intent that identifies the 'limit of the usefulness of a set', at which point additional variation is necessary to solve new problems, which is a similar problem as differentiating 'identify interactions of generative variables' and 'identify interactions of generated variables' (indicating the limit of the usefulness of the generative variables)

    - identifying useful structures like intents such as 'new structures to apply new variation between (to resolve their connections)' as specific variants of generally useful intents like 'find new variables' is useful to identify other useful implementation structures like 'different uncertainty spaces' (where new variation is likely to occur)
        - for example, 'identifying new structures to apply new variation between' is a useful problem-solving intent, like identifying how similarities/differences have 'areas of uncertainty' like neutral areas where a structure could be either a similarity or a difference (so its a neutral structure rather than a similarity/difference), which is a source of 'ambiguities'
            - this space between 'extreme similarities/differences' is an alternative uncertainty space than a standard uncertainty space like in the 'regression (polynomials)' problem space
            - identifying all the uncertainty spaces is a way to identify 'overlaps of these spaces and mappings between them and other interface structures of them', and also each individual space is likely to make some connection more clear than other spaces like layered spaces as occur in the regression problem space, which doesnt isolate different variables of uncertainty but rather includes them all
            - applying variation in these spaces is useful to 'identify new variables', a generally useful problem-solving intent
            - identifying structures like 'opposing limits' is a simpler example of finding 'structures to apply variation between' and relatedly, identifying structures like 'directions where a limit hasnt been identified yet' are useful as 'directions to apply variation in'
        - relatedly, identifying symmetries as 'dependence' structures (and as 'having reversible changes') is useful to identify, which adjacently identifies 'causing independence' as a way to 'break symmetries' and similarly identifying other structures that fulfill interface structures of symmetries are useful to identify
        - relatedly, identifying 'equivalences that create maximal differences (that dont violate the equivalences used to create them)' (like the Banach-Tarski paradox) is useful to identify as adjacent structures to 'symmetry-breaking' structures, as identifying the positions of these structures also identifies possible variation in between them, just like its useful to identify 'randomness' as adjacent to 'independence' and 'irreversibility'
        - relatedly, identifying 'symmetry-breaking' structures is a 'source of variation' (a way to create time, by creating independence structures)
        - relatedly, identifying the 'ways that one structures like symmetries can be used for enabling relevant variation' and the "ways its variations like 'symmetry-breaking' structures can be used to enable relevant variation" and the "ways to differentiate these ways like 'ratios of aggregate/similarity structures'" are useful to identify uncertainties that are valuable to maintain (rather than standardizing everything to be a symmetry, maintaining some difference in this spectrum to enable more relevant variation than either extreme can), since there are 'symmetries that are useful to apply as constants' (and the same for their variations) rather than selecting constants or variations for these high variation structures like symmetries

    - identifying useful structures by applying interface structures to identified useful structures to generate new problem-solving intents to filter for useful uncertainty
        - for example, identifying the following questions is useful to direct variation applications:
            - what 'info can a similarity identify', if applied as a standard/base (what variation is supported, and what variation is obvious, once standardized using that similarity)
            - what 'non-standardized info' is useful to compare (in general, what non-formatted info is useful for functions using that format), as in what differences can replace the standardization (such as 'local comparisons within a type' rather than 'comparison across types after standardization'), which indicates which 'standards can replace each other (as alternates/substitutes)'
            - what 'changes can be applied to abstract info structures' (like ratios of sequences) that preserve a range of usefulness (like ratios of non-standardized info)
            - what 'variables contain enough info for a simple comparison' (like points on a plane or ratios of sequences) to be useful (those structures requiring 'high variation storage, such as aggregate/summary info' like a 'convergent or other determining value of a sequence' in order to be useful), which determines 'what inputs do these abstract info structures require'
        - these are 'interface changes of existing useful structures' that contain enough uncertainty, that there could be new useful structures identifiable with these changes
        - relatedly, identifying 'questions to resolve ambiguities between interface structures' is useful (questions such as 'are these structures similar, or are their definitions poorly defined')
        - relatedly, identifying 'volatility' is useful to resolve 'ambiguities' (which involve 'subtle/trivial/adjacent but important/reflective of high variation/relevant differences'), and pre-filtering the problem by identifying what intents could benefit from differentiating subtle differences until theyre obvious or otherwise useful in some way is similarly useful, like identifying ways that high variation structures like 'ratios between sequences' and 'abstractions' can reflect different info but still seem similar in a false way (false as in a 'very low ratio of similarity')

    - identifying useful structures like 'specific variables (such as assumptions)' which prevent other info relevant to problem-solving from being 'adjacently derivable' which act like 'info barriers' (but are not defined to be 'info barriers', which is why its useful to identify them as such), which can be removed to find alternate problem-solving methods
        - for example, identifying that 'analyzing the problem from a position in a problem space or applying the problem as an assumption or default context' results in an 'assumption that there is a solution in the problem space or that the solution is adjacent' which prevents adjacently deriving alternative problem-solving methods like 'removing the problem space causes' which are not adjacent to derive from those assumptions, bc the 'assumption that the solution is adjacent' prevents other methods from being derived, and identifying other structures that result in the increased/reduced 'derivation distance' of other methods is useful
        - relatedly, identifying the most 'un/coordinating variables' is useful as a way to identify probable reality-covering sets/sequences, such as how 'randomly' can be applied to nearly every function/structure/variable set, as opposed to specific structures like 'electrical' which rarely adjacently apply to function/structure/variable sets (except when standardized to a specific interface like an energy/light interface), as a set of defaults to avoid or apply as probably relevant/useful variables
            - similarly, identifying interface structures (in what positions and for what reasons and in what contexts) of a 'structure that seems useful for some intent' where it would not be useful is a useful set to identify, such as how 'applying "primes" in a variable count position for the intent of "adding variation as in uniqueness"' would not actually be useful in most cases ('variable count' would rarely need or be useful to be 'prime'), where the few cases it would be useful in are identifiable (like 'creating spirals'), is useful to identify this 'ratio of useful/useless cases' of a structure and similarly, identifying other differences/similarities between those useful/useless cases is useful to identify the structures that fulfill those ratios/connections
        - similarly, identifying other ways that interface structures ('assumptions') can act like other interface structures like 'info barriers' (similarities in functionality of interface structures) by applying them in different interactions/contexts/variables/other interface structures (like a 'specific problem where this simmilarity is obvious' like the 'problem of identifying alternate problem-solving functions, from a low-info position created by assumptions'), is possible to identify the variables of, to identify other structures that are connected, and identify other types of connections (similarities in potential/connections/requirements/outputs/etc)
        - identifying differences from simpler variables (simple filters like 'combinations', 'maximal differences', 'iterations', 'valid sequences', 'obvious/simple patterns', 'recursions', 'unused structures') is possible by applying additional differences to identify coordinating variables, which are likelier to explain new problems (like how manifolds are defined to allow 'distance expansions/reductions' and 'slope changes' but not other changes like 'connectivity changes' which allow some other set of changes 'shape changes' and 'surface area changes' and prevent others like 'relative position changes' and 'point existence changes (within some subset of determining points allowing it to exist)', so identifying 'variables that havent been held constant' or 'variables that havent been combined as variables with a set of constants' is useful to 'identify new variation' and identifying 'similarities in differences' like 'changes that create other changes'), and similarly identifying these 'change coordinations' are useful to apply as 'interaction level-crossing structures' or 'cross-interface structures' (like structures that connect 'specific/abstract intent levels') as well as interface query components
        - similarly, identifying ways to make complex filters simple (computing a 'similarity index explaining the variation contained by a filter' is useful to make a complex filter simpler to apply by applying the 'insight of the similarity' as a simple alternative to identifying/generating understanding of the whole complex variable, just like computing a 'validity-identifying function for sequences, by checking whether inputs/outputs in the sequence can interact in defined/valid ways' makes a 'validity' filter simpler to apply) is useful to identify, which is useful to identify new variables that are not simplifiable with similarity indexes or other structures that reflect understanding (unknown structures)
        - relatedly, identifying 'similarities to problem-solving structures' (like 'problem/solution connection sequences' and 'inputs to solution metrics like sensitivity') which are likely to have some 'similarities' (like overlaps), is useful to identify possible base sequences to apply in workflows involving sequences (like 'find the point on the sensitivity causal sequence where a problem is likely to exist, then start applying sensitivity causes to the problem to create the solution'), since 'sensitivity' is a solution metric, where this similarity can be used as a 'proxy/substitute', and similarly identifying 'overlaps between multiple solution metric causal sequences' is useful to identify structures that solve for multiple solution metrics and the connections between those structures
            - relatedly, identifying structures that fulfill multiple solution metrics, like how 'abstractions' (such as an abstraction of similarity like an 'abstract average (which covers most info in a set)' or a 'ratio between abstractions (a ratio between high info structures)', both structures capturing a high ratio of information when applied with abstractions) fulfill both 'generalizability' and 'accuracy', is useful to identify other probable solution sequences for solution metric sets
        - identifying 'more achievable/adjacent/useful intents' like 'determining the direction of causation between high variation variables like sensitivity and volatility' (which should be quite achievable with existing resources, 'direction' being a very measurable variable, and causal networks being usable to resolve the interactions of these variable definitions, and both of these variables being very 'well and completely defined' and being very useful to determine the 'causal direction' and other interface structures of these 'high variation variable connections') is useful to identify as 'more useful intents to solve for than some problems' which are useful to identify and apply as a problem-solving intent

    - identifying common variables (like 'efficiency' or 'relevantly similar but different') of useful structures like 'probability sequences' and 'relevant double meanings' to apply as optimization/efficiency structures or base structures to standardize other structures to or apply as a base for changes to create different structures
        - for example, 'probability of x, given some probability of an input y' (similarity in the probability connection created by some set of different structures) and 'relevant double meanings' (different meaning for the same word) are both 'connections/similarities between relevant differences in interface structures like probability/meaning', so identifying all the interface structures that are 'similar but different' in an efficient way (like re-using the same word or connecting independent variables) is useful to identify possible new useful structures
        - relatedly, identifying all the interface structures that can be standardized/connected to these specific 'similar but different' interface structures, like how 'input/output sequences' are connectible to 'probability of x, given some variable y (presumed to be an input)', are useful to identify where there are missing connections and what interfaces explain these connections (a similarity in usefulness of a structure can result in commonness of a structure and therefore cross-system similarity from that structure, which can override 'independence' of variables, a hierarchy connecting interface structures like similarity/commonness/independence/probability that is useful to identify by identifying alternate definitions/routes which can provide similarly useful/powerful structures, like how 'similarity in usefulness of a structure across systems' can identify causal connections even across independent systems through 'commonness of useful structures', bc 'frequency' is a high variation interface structure in its connection to 'probability', so systems which are independent from each other still arent independent from interface structures like commonness/usefulness/similarity and arent independent from iterated effects, like how an independent system might let another system develop the same useful structures, making it likelier for another system to develop those structures through its independence, where if a system is independent enough from its useful structures and common enough, other systems might be able to develop the same structures, increasing the ratio of independence, a ratio that is useful to identify if its self-sustaining, a generally relevant variable)
        - relatedly, optimizations of these specific 'similar but different' interface structures (like optimizations of 'probability of x, given some probability of an input y' such as 'cases where these variables are on separate causal sequences or in separate systems or can be both inputs or outputs or are indirectly related, but still adjacently connectible, like how common structures tend to have variables in common even though these structures may develop in different systems, which makes the probability more surprising as in maximally different when simple, and therefore this probability sequence is more useful in those cases where an adjacent connection explains causally distant structures') are useful to identify a network to identify useful positions/connections of these useful structures to indicate their optimal usage
        - relatedly, identifying different structures than 'similar but different' by applying interface structures like units/waves/grids such as a set of 'waves that vacillate between related useful structures unlikely to be resolved like spectrum variables' or a grid that regularly applies some structure like a 'similarity/filter/variable' or a 'spectrum grid' is useful to identify possible alternate useful sequences/networks to apply as components of workflows
        - similarly, identifying the other useful interface structures of interface structures is useful (identifying 'sequences of useful interface structures' is useful to identify interface queries or their components and identifying 'combinations of useful interface structures' is useful to identify structures like 'cross-interface structures, like structure/function sets, such as combination-differentiation or sequence-distribution or set-filtering')
        - similarly, identifying cross-interface connections like how 'lack of meaning' is associated with specific 'functions' (like 'iteration') of a 'structure' is useful to identify as a limit/filter for interface queries

    - identifying new variation by identifying new interactions between interface structures to solve problems with, by identifying sets that are likely to interact in useful ways (applying a 'specific context' like 'the uncertainty space in regression' and a 'filter' like the 'threshold indicated by change/info structures where a pattern becomes obvious' and a 'specific intent to solve for in that context' like 'identifying the concepts that cover all similarities/differences in that space like volatility/specificity' or 'identifying the concepts that allow the most variation in that space' or 'identifying the "limit-reversing variables" or the "most stackable/embeddable variables" in that space')
        - for example, identifying 'integrations of orthogonal useful structures' (orthogonal as in 'cross-interface' or 'not using definitions in common' or 'causally alternate/distant' or otherwise independent useful structures of interface structures) like the 'change structures like difference ratios and info structures like information minimums that make a pattern obvious' and the 'uncertainty space between linearity and randomness in a relevant space like regression' and 'similarity indexes in a relevant format like polynomials' is useful as a way to identify new problem-solving intents and functions, where these structures arent exactly standardized to be directly mappable but are integratable (such as 'identifying functions/positions in this uncertainty space not covered by identified similarity indexes' and 'identifying thresholds that make a variable like volatility or specificity obvious in this uncertainty space'), which are likely to be useful in identifying the structures in that space, 'integrating maximally orthogonal structures' being likely only possible in this space and also useful for identifying the highest variation-covering structure in that space
        - identifying the most orthogonal/different/independent interface structures is similarly possible to automate and similarly useful for this problem-solving intent
        - 'limit-reducing variables' are the variables (like abstraction) mentioned elsewhere that increase variation after some reduction in info/variation
        - these 'useful structures' have differences that would be valuable to connect to create new variation, and are 'iterated structures' (structures of interface structures, as opposed to core defined interface structures) and are useful in their specificity, so identifying their interactions and the useful sets to apply them with (context/filter/intent) is useful
        - applying these math abstraction structures (like 'find an optimal ratio between two relevant sequences') to interface structures is useful ('applying useful problem-solving structures to interface structures' as a problem-solving intent)
            - for example, the 'ratio of opposing functions like growth/reduction functions that allows structures to exist (favoring growth enough for anything to exist)' is useful to identify as well as the remaining variation in these functions that hasnt been identified yet (what useful increasing sequence could exist that hasnt been identified yet), where the 'opposition' makes the opposing function useful, which is useful to identify other structures that make other structures useful, and similarly every other 'ratio between interface structures (like function sets, interaction levels, etc)' that allows variation to exist are useful to identify as limits beyond which errors would occur
            - similarly, 'defaults' are usually not useful structures (though some trivial ratio may be, which is why they exist) and rather iterated structures differentiating from defaults are the useful structures in comparison
            - identifying relevance structures which involve a 'similarity to base differences on' (like spectrums like 'adjacent/distant' to differentiate adjacent/distant structures within the same spectrum variable) as possible variables that change 'usefulness' is useful as a problem-solving intent
            - identifying all of the 'common sources' of useful structures by applying interface structures to identified useful structures (like 'graphs') to find overlaps between these sequences of interface structures is useful to find 'queries to generate useful structures' as well as their common variables, where these 'common sources' can form a network to base changes on to find other solutions
            - similarly, the 'structures' of the interface network are useful to identify (its limits, its variants, its useful iterations, its iteration limits, its optimization limits, etc)

    - identifying useful structures like 'geometric interface structures' (like the 'variation around a line', where the line is the base for change, such as in regression) and a way to integrate those into related identified problem-solving structures like 'geometric intents' (such as 'reduce a problem to a point on a plane') is useful as a problem-solving index to compute (such as 'identifying the highest variation-supporting lines in a problem-space and convert those lines into possible planes where the problem can be reduced to a point, then filter the possible planes'), which are useful applications of the abstract/specific interface to generate a workflow ('specify a geometric structure' and 'use it to connect abstract info structures')
        - identifying 'anti-interfaces' is useful as oppositions of the definition of similarity/symmetry in some way (different in that they indicate 'similarities in differences' or that they indicate 'constants' rather than some structure of variation, or that they limit change rather than supporting change, etc), which is useful as an alternate reality-covering variable but also identifies the more complete set of structures that should be applied in coordination (an anti-interface and an interface being a useful vertex to solve problems on, for example), similar to how identifying 'structures that vary around limits' as opposed to 'structures that vary around averages/similarities' are useful as different variants of interfaces
        - relatedly, identifying the structures that a problem can always be standardized to (such as identifying whether there is 'always' a small variable set that determines some system) is useful to connect these structures, such as how there would likely always be low-dimensional generative variable sets of a problem that can identify 'at least a grid or network (adjacent structures to a plane), if not a plane', and identifying connections between these known planes is useful to 'identify new variable connections (new insights)' as a new problem-solving intent ('identifying new connections between known solution structures like identified planes that describe a problem/solution' is likely to contain solutions to new problems)
            - relatedly, 'identifying new variable connections' is a proxy for 'identifying new variables', as these new variable connections can often be applied elsewhere to 'identify new variables'
            - relatedly, the structure of a 'plane that maps problems/solutions' is useful to identify, as a 'generative variable set of problem/solution connections' is a useful problem-solving structure to cover some ratios of problems
            - relatedly, identifying the set of 'planes' where problems/solutions are mappable by low dimension counts like two dimensions is possible bc some variable sets are reality-covering (like for example 'general' and 'accurate'), and identifying connections between these known planes are useful to identify new variables/new connections between variables, though such a general variable set is likely to have a different structure than a structure implying a 'different solution for every different problem' which is what a plane implies
        - applying insights and connecting them to problem-solving intents is useful, such as how applying the insight 'all structures can be interactive, bc measurable structures arent completely independent', so identifying new ways for structures to interact on some angle of difference like complexity/opposite is possible as a way to identify variation and therefore alternate timelines
        - understanding as a problem-solving intent, as it reduces required work, for example noticing that a 'war winning' ('conflict resolution', by 'selecting one entity as a winner') problem can be converted into a resource distribution problem ('distribution of resources, as a proxy of distribution of justice') is useful to understand that problem-solving is fundamentally a 'variation-moving' process (moving the variation from 'selecting a winner' to 'distributing justice'), which reduces the work to 'finding ways to convert/preserve variation across transfers to different core functions like select/distribute/differentiate' which are different types of differences, which requires work like 'identifying this core function network' as opposed to 'selecting a winner of a conflict', which results in other problems like 'avoiding conflicts' and 'helping one side win' and 'getting consensus', which is more work and more repeated work than the relatively optimal 'identifying this core function network'
        - identifying 'understanding' in a problem space is a matter of matching abstract structures like symmetries ('differences in similarities', like limits such as physical laws, between which variation can occur, which is like how variation can occur around symmetries) and anti-symmetries ('similarities in differences') and other symmetry structures in a problem space
        - these structures have a common geometric root of 'variation around a point' (variation around an average), 'variation around a line' (variation around a connection), 'variation around a plane', 'variation around a network', 'variation within a spectrum' and other simple structures which often solve problems, which are useful as a problem-solving intent (find all the ways that known variable interactions can be formatted as these core structures of symmetries and anti-symmetries and spectrums like variables/constants)
            - then the more complex structures can be found by connecting these units of variation, like 'variation between relevant networks' and 'variation in supported embedded variables on a network' and eventually connecting these units of variation to interfaces like concepts such as 'variation potential' of an interface
            - identifying these mathematized abstract variation units are useful in that they apply understanding of problem-solving as a problem of 'identifying bases around which variation occurs or identifying limits of variation' and 'identifying abstract variation', the resulting intent of these insights being that 'identifying these mathematized abstract variation units' is the most useful work (relative to other function sets, like identifying specific implementations of one vertex like generate/filter as a one-perspective problem-solving method that captures less variation than 'identifying geometric abstract info structures and apply them as composable units of variation/time/reality')
        - relatedly, creating an 'infinite abstract info observer' is a useful concept in computing new math structures (a computer whose base unit is an abstract info structure like abstract concepts that cover reality, or other high variation structures like number classes that cover reality or other types of infinities), since measurements/descriptions can only be as good as the observer's ability to measure/interpret variation correctly
        - identifying 'volatility' as a filter of algorithms is useful (such as 'reducing volatility' to 'reduce complexity by reducing adjacency of different structures' of 'finding similar structures') as a generally applicable structure that can also improve algorithms when relevant (connectible by complexity/adjacency/difference) to structures like common intents like 'find similar structures' that are relevant to problem-solving
            - similarly, identifying structures like 'sequences/combinations of variables like volatility' in the 'uncertainty space between linearity and randomness' is useful to fulfill other intents like 'identifying equivalent interactions and identify stackable/embeddable interactions'
            - relatedly, defining 'randomness' as the 'interaction of similar variation-containing structures (as opposed to similar as in coordinating structures)' is useful, like how a positive sloped line could be made to look like randomness with an opposing negative-sloped line (an opposing structure that could be created randomly by multiple units of that slope) where the 'ratio of variation contained in either structure' is similar (the 'negative line is different enough from the positive line to look like randomness, if both are sampled', and the 'multiple unit combination is different enough to create that difference')
        - identifying structures that coincide with 'irrelevant' usefulness (like irrelevant errors/solutions) are useful to identify (as an opposing structure of relevant usefulness), like 'being in a position near a high variation structure' being likelier to increase probability of 'random errors/solutions', where these irrelevant errors are useful to avoid by applying filters like 'filters of solution/error high variation structures' and functions like 'increasing causal degree to increase independence' (such as a combination of functions like 'increase causal degree by one, then check if either the solution/error filter is triggered' which coordinate to fulfill an intent, in cases like where some 'adjacent change might trigger an approximately applicable/similar filter', a useful structure set to apply as a component of workflows)

    - identifying useful structures like 'changes in spectrum variable change sequences, resulting from problem/solution identifications and system interactions' which are highly determining of other structures
        - identifying 'removing variation in problem spaces' as a suboptimal solution structure as it 'prevents the resolution of complex variable interactions'
        - identifying problems caused by 'changing position of variation/constants' and their solutions is useful as a common problem resulting from solutions (when a solution to a problem is found, the solution is held constant and the variation is applied or develops elsewhere, often adjacently, and sometimes caused by the newly constant solution structure)
        - identifying a 'grid of reality' where, for example, 'embeddings/generators and filters/constants are alternated' reflecting the 'structure of queries', such as a 'variable/constant' alternating query, where structures that add variation (like abstractions/embeddings/uncertainties) are applied to oppose constants/filters/specifications/certainties, and identifying the ways that these grids can be integrated to allow all the known possible queries that reality allows
        - identifying 'sequences of relative optimals' (like 'heavens') are useful to identify as 'probable sequences', which are likely to become more optimal as the sequence progresses and are likely to be used/identified
        - identifying 'definitions that allow variation' as 'default/constant' structures including 'variables' (definitions that increase the variation of other definitions) is useful as a way of identifying 'unsolved problems' (resolving 'all the differences between variables and constants', which is unnecessary if 'most determining/differentiating variable connections' are identified, given the 'set of differences already identified', which is different in 'different problem spaces and timelines and positions', as some problems only exist if there are 'other sequences of problems already solved' or 'other co-occurring problems/solutions')
        - identifying the structures of 'types' as 'relevant embedding stacks' where vertexes across embeddings are useful to identify ('identify the vertexes that differentiate two different types' as a way to reduce the 'classification' problem to a 'vertex-identification' problem)
        - identifying structures like 'ratios of abstract structures' (like the ratio of 'simplicity/complexity') as a way of 'determining probable structures', given that the 'simplicity/complexity of a problem space' may be changed by some solution temporarily, but will often show 'vacillation patterns', returning to some previous ratio when an 'opposing solution to that solution is identified', as 'opposing intents' often co-exist in systems rather than always being resolved immediately
            - similarly, determining ways these ratios can change (other than simple known structures like 'vacillations') is useful, since they act more like 'bases or limits of change' than absolute constants
            - given that 'useful structures' determine 'intent structures' much of the time (once a useful structure is identified like a resource, an intent develops to 'get/use that structure'), similar to how 'intent structures' determine 'function structures' (once a goal is identified, functions are developed to fulfill it), identifying these 'cycles/sequences between abstractions or interfaces' is useful to identify as a base for queries involving 'determining sequences' (like 'filter sequences') as well as identifying 'useful indexes to compute' and 'ways to skip ahead in a determined sequence (like from 'useful' to 'functions', either skipping intent or applying an intent index to connect these)
            - these 'structures' (like ratios) of 'abstract structures' provide a way to identify 'outer limits of complexity, using some structure set', which can be applied as a limit to differentiate from 'already computed ratios' (like 'ratios between relevant sequences') and determine the complexity in between this set of limits (determined by a 'constant' and a 'computational limit' of high variation structures like 'abstract structures'), 'identifying limits of variation in opposite directions' being a useful problem-solving intent

    - identifying the useful structures like abstract useful structures like 'cross-interface structures' (like 'intent-alignment') and 'network networks' that can be possibly useful and identify their useful position on a network in connection to other variants of these structures
        - applying 'alignments' and other useful structures as a 'base network to start integrating with other networks' (representing solution metrics or other bases and so on), such as how the 'predator group' might also benefit from 'reducing the number of predators', as well as 'other groups' benefitting from a 'reduction in the number of predators', as the remaining predators would have 'more success/resources and therefore fewer problems to solve with violence in the first place', and identifying all the alignments or the maximum possible coexisting alignments is useful to apply as a base network (given these 'alignments in intents/incentives' as a core structure and given this 'variant of an intent/incentive alignment network that maximizes freedom for agents', how can society/variables be built around this 'optimal intent/incentive-alignment network variant', such as 'one predator per village, where they are given permission to prey on other predators to keep the ratio low, bc society still needs killers of predators, and if they dont use the permission for that, they become targets, in a predator-management app/internet', which is useful as a interim step to other solutions like isolating predators, which is more trivial once already reduced in number, and as an alternative to simultaneously integratable solutions like 'offering incentives to develop intelligence automation and other tech that can end the problem of predators, like giving them time/resources to solve problems like resource distribution or be killed'), which is once again a 'relevant ratio between structures like groups, this time "opposing groups (predators/victims) that always oppose each other, until a ratio is crossed"' which has a related structure of 'intersections between seemingly unrelated structures', where the 'direction of change after the intersection is useful info to solve the problem'
            - similarly, identifying the 'optimal position' of these cross-interface structures, vertexes, combinations, orthogonalities, queries, and other 'structures of interface structures' is useful as a problem-solving intent (whether to apply intent-alignment as a network, specifically a base network to apply/fit other variables to)
        - applying useful specifications to useful structures like 'abstract solutions' such as identifying 'new variables (like the cases not solvable with abstract solutions, indicating a new abstraction)', for example, specifying that a 'solving a problem by identifying the emergent ratio between relevant structures like sequences' is useful specifically when there is a change structure (like a 'change rate change' or 'change rate extreme' or 'change rate interim/average' that creates a rel
