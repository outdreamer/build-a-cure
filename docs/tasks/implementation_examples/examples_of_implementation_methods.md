- examples of other implementation methods than documented default methods (like the 'apply/find/build/derive' function set)

- how to implement the interface analysis framework as a set of simple functions for an initial version, involving alternate default constant simple structures to combine, such as:
    - symmetry structures applied as a default variable structure, rather than 'incremental change combinations', so that by default, symmetry combinations are sought, rather than incremental change combinations, to always frame change in terms of symmetries
    - combinations of useful intents (such as those that are relevant/realistic) as a default interface to base changes on, finding the functions to fulfill them at query time, as implementation variables
    - structures of relevant cross-interface structures as a default structure to apply changes to
        - for example, 'patterns of causal structures of structures of structures' (like the patterns of cause of 'a sequence of structures that develops from another structure')
	- functions that act like useful filters of relevant information, such as:
	    - a function that can determine an attribute like 'change type' that reveals similarity/difference of a relevant structure like 'output change type'
	- applying specific interface structures as a default constant set
		- applying 'information' interface interaction rules of the 'physical reality' interface such as:
			- 'truths can become false when over-depended on, beyond their appropriate context or meaning, or beyond their potential to illuminate or support other truths, or in an incorrect structure like a foundation for other truths'
			- 'truths can be so irrelevant to an intent as to be equivalent to false (example: citing the heat death as a reason not to try to do anything)'
			- 'truths can be so rarely/improbably true as to be equivalent to false (example: an error state that is so rare you basically dont have to plan for it, like where neutrinos would flip all the bits on a server at once)'
			- 'truths can be so unstable (difficult to maintain) as to be equivalent to false (example: a rare atomic state that degrades into another more stable state more frequently)'
			- 'truths can be so difficult to verify/calculate as to be equivalent to false (example: number of atoms in the universe)'
			- 'truths can be so non-adjacent to other probable/known truths as to be equivalent to false (example: future truth of a reality that is non-adjacent to current reality)'
			- 'truths can be so lacking in reasons as to be equivalent to false (example: there is no reason for a rare anomaly except random coincidence so it may as well be ignorable)'
		- applying interim connecting structures of useful structures representing the truth like 'rules databases', 'attribute networks', etc, such as 'common structures to both systems' such as 'constant attribute rules' (variable interaction rules)
		- applying useful reality representation structures such as 'metaphors (similar/relevant but different/inaccurate structures to format something differently in a useful way to achieve understanding)'
		- applying physics rules such as the 'fuzziness of physical reality' as a way to find other true structures ('symmetries', 'alternative definitions', 'patterns')
		- applying structures like the functions that can generate the highest variation (such as the 'Conway game of life') as a default structure to generate other high-variation structures like reality
		- applying specific mappings across interface structures (like concepts such as 'balance', physics structures like 'symmetry', and physical reality structures such as information agent structures such as 'justice' and 'economic equilibrium', or concepts like 'interface', structures like 'bases', information structures like 'metaphors' being variable implementations of the 'interface' concept) as default structures (such as default inputs of a neural network used to predict other mappings)
		- apply useful perspective structures (like combinations of perspectives such as the 'optimization perspective' and the 'religious perspective' to efficiently describe other useful structures like 'what agents want and what could be true using adjacent transforms of reality') as a default constant set
		- apply useful structure sets that should go together (like how 'dependence' is useful in the 'causal' interface but negative in the 'physical reality' interface)
		- apply useful structures (like 'direction or line connecting starting/goal points' and 'implementation structures to get to that point') to model useful structures that are useful when applied together, like 'intents/implementations of intents', as a useful input to neural networks to fulfill the task of 'adjacently combining them in a way that connects them'
		    - similarly apply patterns of implementation structures such as 'causal loops referencing nested sub-problems resolved with some structure and output to the host structure once solved' as default components of implementations of intents
		- fulfill a primary function of a particular interface that can solve most problems, such as 'evaluate meaning', and the useful functions to fulfill that function efficiently
		- apply structures iteratively to calculate the global/universal meaning to check if its obviously false at scale (in its extreme form which is more easily determined), such as applying a rule like 'its ok to violate someones rights if theyre a genius and youre fascinated by them' (after iterating to an extreme scale, its obvious that no, that couldnt be right, then geniuses wouldnt want to live if that rule is applied at scale, to guarantee that geniuses' rights will always be violated, and it couldnt be right for many other reasons, such as it is probably 'better/more sustainable/and therefore lower cost' to prioritize turning people into geniuses than to persecute geniuses with rights violations which will reduce our supply of geniuses to zero)
			- structures that make other structures obvious are obviously useful
		    - apply interactions of known structures at scale as default filters of other scaled structures, determining what else can exist at that scale, deriving core structures of truth from these scaled structures that could also exist at that scale
		- apply structures that can be used for multiple intents as default useful structures bc they can handle more variation than other structures and are therefore likelier to be compoundingly useful when applied in structures like combinations
		- apply structures that can offset neural network inadequacies such as 'limits of a series' being useful for solving the problem of modeling 'longer sequences of input/output connections' as a tool to determine when a sequence might converge, which is obviously useful for prediction intents, as well as other structures that allow the user to 'see far ahead', such as 'highly complex/different realistic/stable/efficient' structures, useful determining functions of extreme attribute similarities/differences (like absolute change type interactions, such as preserved change types when some function is applied) as 'extreme' structures and 'equivalent alternate structures (that can keep each other in check and identify invalid structures)', and other structures that allow you to efficiently calculate a lot from a little information
		    - you can see how useful functions (like calculating an adjacent attribute such as 'constance/addition' that reveals non-adjacent information like information about 'extreme change type preservation') act like a powerful information filter that reveals information that is difficult to calculate (non-adjacent)
		    - finding useful structures to determine attributes of other useful structures (useful structures like 'extremes') can be done by reverse-engineering 'input problem cases' where these revelatory 'filter' structures would be useful:
		        - finding highly different structures like extremes or complex manifolds (high-variation change based on an interface like a connected structure such as a manifold, which is a useful math structure adjacently mapped/corresponding to an interface)
		        - determining what is easily determined about that highly different structure once you know it
		        - determining what cases this information could be useful in
		        - determining whether those cases are useful
		    - similarly apply functions to 'calculate convexity' and 'filter possible functions given maximal differences (structurally similar change types that can look similar at first like exponential change, waves, hyperbolic functions, etc but which have adjacent filters to filter them out) detected by some point' as a way of improving 'gradient descent errors'
		    	- you can see how these 'interface structural similarities' (like an 'exponentially increasing subset') provide a useful constant base to apply changes to, to determine other possible structures and identify filters of those possible structures
		    	- this is an embedded application of the 'interface' concept, which is clear in the usefulness of this 'similarity to base changes on'
		- apply interaction levels ('adjacently connectible structures that interact/connect') as 'input information' or an 'information format' to neural networks (which fulfill the task of 'finding adjacent combinations to connect variables')
	- applying a function to find interaction levels where the problem is solvable with adjacent combinations and the function to find those adjacent combinations once transformed to that interaction level
	- iterating through filtered interface structure combinations and checking test cases of input/output pairs
	- create a network of solutions to use as bases to navigate
	- iterate constant/variable pairs to model the highest degree of certainty/uncertainty pairs
	- applying more adjacently determinable structures as an input
	    - attribute networks as an input and function networks as an output implementing those attribute networks
	- finding an 'input-output sequence' that would be useful and would probably be adjacently constructible in that sequence
	    - like a sequence of first building an 'attribute network' to describe all variables and then building a 'function network' describing that network and then a 'function generator network' to compress/generate that function network
	- applying default interface structures as the core functions of a machine learning network so that errors like 'not understanding abstract concepts' can be avoided by injecting abstract concepts as a default input or function or related structure, so that 'combinations of abstract concepts' required to 'solve a problem of understanding some conceptual combination' are adjacent
	- finding all high-variation variables/functions and applying that as a base to describe other high-variation variables/functions
	- apply optimization interaction structures (like a 'set of game strategies that can result in a tie') as being useful structures to model other useful structures like 'interchangeable equivalent alternates'
	- apply the 'biggest differences in between known problems/solutions' as a set of useful differences to apply to model other differences which are likely to be more connectible than those differences
	- apply combinations of workflows to find other workflows, to find solution-finding methods
	- apply structures guaranteed to be relevant (like 'changes within x causal degrees') as a default set of structures likely to be useful in solving a problem, then apply other useful structures like 'combinations/input-output sequences' to those structures to find the useful set of structures to solve the problem
	- apply a sequence of these other implementation methods as a way of designing a path from mvp to final product
    - apply useful structures that are more adjacent to solutions than problems are, such as a structure including 'interactive structures' and 'useful descriptions of the problem'
        - the better explained a problem is with the best representation of it, the easier it is to solve it
    - finding structures that represent the most interface structures (like a 'high variation structure that represents various core interface structures like interactions and requirements and generative functions')
    - finding structures that describe most problems/solutions in terms of interface structures such as 'a breaking of an interface' or 'misrouting of randomness' or a 'structure of resolution between ambiguous alternates' and other useful interface descriptions of useful structures, so these can be re-applied or applied as defaults or core structures
    - similar to how solving a maze can involve applying these structures, as 'equivalent alternate' structures that can provide the same or similarly useful information in solving the maze, deriving other useful possible solutions is possible by applying useful concepts like 'incentives' (to derive basic structures likely to occur)
       - applying regular 'direction of motion' checks to make sure the agent is still traveling toward the goal and not repeating routes
       - applying standard maze configurations as possible alternatives to select from
       - solving for standard tricks to check for in a maze that are incentivized and therefore likely to be encountered, and solving for the solutions to those tricks
       - solving for interactive sequences of paths that coordinate/cancel each other and can/cannot exist in the same maze
       - solving for 'maximal filters' that can filter out possible mazes the most efficiently
       - apply reverse-engineering to find indicators of various possible sequences of end paths nearest the exit
       - these structures involve solving other problems than 'apply any route using trial & error as a base solution, and change it as you go' which is a default solution to solving a maze
       - solving problems like mazes is a proxy for solving other problems bc of the high variation captured in a maze, if the maze reflects realistic randomness and other variable interaction patterns enough, similar to solving other games if they reflect realistic structures enough
    - a set of useful descriptions of reality that have reasons why they could be true (like a 'calculator of efficient methods of preserving energy cycles' and a 'structure to support maximal variation/uncertainty (time)' and a 'stable alternate coexisting sequence (time) finder') are useful to apply as defaults and efficient structures and truth structures, as well as the variables creating uncertainties (like 'unknown beneficiaries of calculations' and the 'maximally different structure' and the 'most stable system that supports the most variation') in these descriptions and the variables between them (such as interface structures like different priorities), as well as the differences between the description and related structures like 'problems solved with that description' and 'priorities fulfilled by that description' which make the meaning and reality of each description more calculatable
    - apply useful structures like 'clarifying structures' which make something obvious similar to how certain filters make some solutions obvious such as 'standardizing' and 'difference-maximizing' filters make differences more obvious
        - for example, finding standardizing structures like 'matrixes' which are a useful format that is also useful for other intents like 'mapping sets of sequential operations' and 'reducing some function to a set of adjacent combinations once in that format' such as 'solving linear systems of equations' 
    - applying useful methods such as methods of deriving information about other useful structures such as 'types' (all members of a type have this attribute that defines the type) and connectivity (constant lines are formed by a type of addition so it makes sense that adding them which is applying more addition doesnt change their shape, as their shape is the product of addition, as opposed to an operation that adds a dimension or restricts range, which would be required to create different shapes)
        - finding the 'type' of an object gives almost free (low-cost) information about that object, bc of the information stored in the type, where the type acts like an interface that can support some variation within the definition
        - other low-cost, high information-producing structures (like abstract concepts such as balance, alternate definitions, interaction levels, similarity to some other known structure, useful filters like standards to derive maximal information, useful networks to know a position in which is a high-information structure in useful networks) can be derived in a similar way and prioritized as default structures to find
    - useful formats of structures similar to a standard network but different in a useful way like 'gap networks of connected empty shapes' to represent related structures like intents to fulfill with implementations filling the shapes, or 'state networks to model useful sequences/queries' or 'maps to model useful connections' or 'map networks to model different analysis perspectives' or 'interface networks to model bases that capture high variation'
    - a set of certainty/uncertainty pairs to apply as default problem/solution structures capturing high variation
    - build sets of 'loosely related possible' associations (which arent guaranteed by definitions but which are allowed) using definition-adjacent connections, like how the connection between variables 'constant' and 'constant squared' involves a definition involving 'multiplication', but also has related attributes that are outputs like curvature which are required by the definition and other connections which are not as relevant like 'constant preservation of data type between input/output as a scalar' which is a loosely associated connections rather than tightly bound by the definition, using these loose associations to discover new possible connections not explicitly defined but also not definitely restricted
    - find component functions of data set subsets and iterate applying these until a non-matching point is found outside of the acceptable error range, adding terms or alternate functions to process in parallel to handle new points where found outside the range
    - find subsets of the data set that shouldnt be reduced to a function bc of complexity and randomness and other factors likely to predict insufficient information or variable injection points or other uncertainties that cant be resolved, where other subsets of the function are clearly mappable to functions
    - find more useful structures to describe variable interactions such as 'variables (such as squares) creating requirements (such as required growth, as in positive or nonzero growth)' and 'variables creating other useful structures like embedded change (change on change, like exponential growth leading to the accretion of matter)' and inputs to these structures like 'equivalences in factors creating self-similarity (in multiplication/area inputs) leading to multiple differences in outputs (of multiplication, compared to adjacent inputs)' which are useful in their capturing of high variation (similarities/equivalences creating differences like multiple differences between change rates of adjacent inputs)
      - the core unit of maximized potential of a variable in its interactions in isolation of other variables (self-interactions) is the area that can be created by the unit of core maximally different interaction (multiplication) with itself, representing its interaction space in the 'adjacent sides of a rectangle' operation (multiplication), leading to its potential (in its possible range of impact, as squaring it is maximizing its differentiability) to influence probabilities
      - finding the important alternate sets of functions that lead to these important structures like 'required growth (a relevant structure of reality)' can generate a 'limit scaffold' ('the model must not contradict required growth of some structure that has growth as a requirement or other form of certainty, as in some variable in the model must not grow in a way that contradicts known required growth of some other variable') that represents 'points of impossibility' that should be used as filters to avoid when modeling reality
      - the intersection of 'generative scaffolds' and 'limit scaffolds' is a useful place to start modeling the dichotomy between certainty/uncertainty to explore, format, & filter the space between them that is allowed by reality
    - finding other useful representations of a function (such as a 'stack of squares of increasing side length' as a useful alternate representation of x-squared to represent the value of y in a clearer way that reflects the equivalence in multiplication inputs and the multiple differences created by the equivalence in multiple dimensions) which increase the relevance and meaning of a function representation, as its probable interactions with other functions is more clear given the core relevant differentiating attribute of equivalent factors
      - similarly, the equivalence in factors leading to a line with slope 1 (1,1, 2,2, 3,3 as inputs) is significant and indicates the relevance of x-squared as different from other functions and more relevant as a unit function of change and indicates the relevance to the output by its squared area created by the difference between these input pair points and the origin
    - applying rules to find highly useful structures like interfaces such as by asking questions in a sequence like:
    	- 'what are the maximal difference-capturing variables like change' (such as 'functions vs. constants') or 'what contradictions exist in useful structures like change' such as 'what changes dont change' and 'what are variables of changes that dont change (limited change around a symmetry)' and 'what changes unchanging variables (constants, symmetries)'
    - rules like "'what is not inputs' are also a cause of structures in addition to inputs" (bc resources not invested determine states of alternate functions) which is another reason to derive missing information (not just to determine what a function will likely do bc of some input but also what other functions could stop that function given missing inputs devoted to alternate functions)
    - an alternate implementation of a 'blur' algorithm to quickly determine trends in a data set is to sample the data set and evaluate each subset quickly to benefit from the overall impression of the emergent pattern visible across a sequence of alternate subsets, where the impression is formed by easily differentiated structures like 'border angles', 'densities', 'ranges', etc which are common across multiple subsets in the sequence, or to align subset data sets as a sequence or network of subsets (organized by some similarity), to make trends more easily identified
    - a function to find the simplest (or otherwise effective) polynomial to describe averages of local data set subsets (where angle of lower/upper borders and densities influence the average) is an example of a standard method that can be found with adjacent structures
    - evaluating a function's 'differences from randomness' is another starting point to base changes on rather than basing them on an average bc its the 'opposite of the intended information' and is therefore similarly useful in that adjacency
        - other function bases include functions that 'connect non-adjacent subset averages', that 'connect adjacent subset averages', 'connect function upper/lower ranges', & other representative/summarizing functions
        - a random data set is not useful and is therefore useful to determine early on in calculations, just like function limits and patterns are useful to determine, and randomness may as well be an indicator of falsehood (as in 'something that needs to be changed in order to determine truth, like requirements/impossibilities') bc of this lack of usefulness
        - other known structures that are not useful are equally likely to use as bases for change, like how known useful structures like core components are, bc of their dichotomy in the certainty of their usefulness
    - building an interface structure of interacting rules to base changes on, like a 'set of requirements' (like how 'connecting components of a structure' is 'required' to 'form component connections to create that structure' by definition) or similarly a 'set of rules that are definitely impossible or not true' as a foundation for other changes (where possibilities exist between contradicting limits imposed by requirements) is a useful structure to start discovering new rules from
        - identifying rules that identify non-adjacent information required by a definition is similarly useful like definitions that identify adjacent/obvious information required by a definition are, like how numbers in a sequence like the set of integers are required to be one unit away from other integers and required to increase if its the set of positive integers, so knowing that a set is sorted in an order like this gives you information about all the numbers between two items in the set bc of the definition determining the set allowing functions like 'estimate where an item will be found to reduce the search space', or how the type of a number determines some of its known functions
    - a standard method to solve problems is framing them in terms of core structures like 'similarities and differences' (like 'similarities to constant representative/average lines', 'similarities to averages', or differences like 'difference-maximizing functions', 'highest angles connecting adjacent/similar subsets as a function that is almost guaranteed to be incorrect to base changes on'), then applying a function to 'determine which differences to resolve' (like 'differences between base functions like averages and alternate similarities like densities' or 'differences from highest angles connecting adjacent subsets and a base average/density-determining function')
        - this method finds the variables likeliest to be known/similar (or easily derived/predicted as adjacent to known variables) constants like 'averages' and 'local subsets (locality as an indicator of similarity)' and 'densities', and variables likeliest to be unknowns like 'alternate more complex functions with more variables' and applies similarities/differences to model those and find which differences are relevant to resolve (the differences that 'connect related similarities/differences', related by providing complementary information for intents like 'represent a data set', complementary information like 'base functions' and 'specifying differences customizing that base')
        - finding a function that models the 'maximally different local subsets of the data set' is a solution-finding method easily produced by this method
