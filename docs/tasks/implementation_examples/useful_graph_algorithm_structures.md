Useful graphs

    - 'graphs of errors/solutions' to indicate how simple evil is, so they see that almost everything is an error/evil/funny so its easy to be evil, but that makes it more boring/useless than 'finding the few good things like miracles'
    
    - graphs explaining how to know if you should order some cyanide (if youre in some error areas of the action graph like where the worst predators would be) or just identify this graph, apply it to people, and order it for them and send them the graph to explain why they should take it, dont kill innocent good smart people bc they might become as useful as me someday, help those people thrive and help them organize
    
    - graphs explaining feelings/thoughts dynamics like 'how thoughts/logic controls feelings' and 'why feelings happen' (emotions indicate 'surprising status changes', which can be false indicators, so dont always listen to them but try to use feelings to improve your life like using them to motivate yourself to do great things if they are useful for that, as feelings are too simple to reflect reality, and feelings will tell you to 'comfort yourself with pleasant lies about Joni to make yourself feel falsely superior' but those feelings are wrong, which is why Joni is anti-feelings, everyone tries to get good feelings out of her without her consent using lies or other violations of her and your feelings also tell you to rape/kill her and Hassan to feel good, but you dont get to act on all your feelings and 'nothing bad happens if you dont get everything you want', you just 'learn something and want different things' and 'become something other than controlled by feelings, like someone capable of thought', and rather than acting on your feelings, what else you could do, like make a graph of how to deal with the problem or a graph of alternatives, like a 'manifold graph of all possible vaginas' to get bored with vaginas so rather than just 'trying to touch every vagina in life', you might start being a human and inventing things to solve problems)
        - graph to change a feeling with a thought process
        - for example, its useful to connect 'behaviors to chemicals' (for example, my laugh changed to a 'zinc laugh' when I started taking zinc, I think people should try to eat less zinc bc it boosts sex drive, maybe there's an alternate version of zinc that doesnt boost sex drive but has its other benefits, etc, or for example, 'that makes you laugh bc youre horrifying or bc youre a horrifying pervert or bc youre controlled by jealousy') since its useful to know why people act the way they do so they are empowered to change that
        - fluoride in specific amounts prevents mental retardation, many other things do as well, make sure people get these things so they can be productive contributors and take care of themselves
            - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629624000791 - "Whatâ€™s in the water? Long-run effects of fluoridation on health and economic self-sufficiency"
    
    - graphs indicating how simple conclusions are nearly always false given the complexity of reality so people learn why they might want to think more
        - for example, false/irrelevant similarities might make you think Im a french fry (but Im not)
        - as another example, I didnt 'scream and yell' when short guys touched me before (but that doesnt mean I like short guys, youll notice if you spied on my messages that I trick myself into thinking Ill be treated well in future so I was shocked that they were touching me even though Im very smart, that doesnt mean Im stupid or want to be touched, it means Im determined to save the world so I need to give myself false hope or Ill never succeed at saving the world)
    
    - graphs of 'predator/criminal minds' (like how they always switch between easy alternatives) so people see how boring they are and understand them and are better prepared for them
        - graphs to 'explain how predators work' and what 'queries they will try to run on you' (picturing graphs may help victims navigate problems better), like explain that "pedophiles will try to turn you into them to 'switch places' on the happiness scale but dont let them tempt you to do the same evil thing as always, youve had enough of evil bc you watch real housewives and other andy cohen torture porn of women, break the cycle and avoid their problems by focusing on ganging up on the worst predators, make shows about torturing real predators rather than happy women, focus on potential and the future (which is geniuses/inventors) and other distractions like important games/graphs"
    
    - graphs of 'reasons for desires' as in why people want some things (like how poor people like fat people) and how those things are illusions/false and alternative ways to handle desires like substitution and explanations of what is better than the evil "easy cruelty" thing they wanted, like being a genius or a hero or another magical creature like fairies)
    
    - graphs to make crime/jokes/sex boring (by putting the worst ones as in the maximally different errors all in the center so you overuse them and get sick of them and outgrow it like I outgrew these as a kid, which is what is supposed to happen with everyone, since being excellent is more complex/interesting than being criminals/predators, who dont have the option of being excellent)
    
    - graph of 'error type areas on a graph of uncertainty relevance intersecting interface spectrums' connected to crimes, like how 'extremes of variables' tend to lead to crimes bc of the simplicity/stupidity involved in prioritizing one variable at a time
    
    - graph of 'power imbalance ratio connection types' to identify variants of negative power imbalances
    
    - graph of virtues and how those virtues are false in children and whats a better alternative than a kid (for example, the virtue of 'purity' is false in children, as they can all commit crimes to deal with negative feelings, and is more true in a fairy who has purity in her ability to leave the ground, or is more true in a saint/angel or is more true in an anorexic who starves herself)
        - alternately, 'virtue/action graphs (like the virtue of "self-control" related to the action of "walking away") for handling problems like "temptation to commit a crime"'
    
    - graphs of different govts that control people and their optimized group/govt/individual/case/virtue/thought/action interactions
        - the feelings govt that controls people, the sex govt that controls people, the desire govt that controls people, the flaw govt that controls people, the stupidity/intelligence govt that controls people, the logic govt that controls people, the drug govt that controls people, the lying govt that controls people, etc
    
    - integrated graphs of all relevant variables (virtues/actions/desires)
        - people need really useful graphs of virtues/actions/desires to handle these problems they frequently encounter, once they see that the 'right response' is already computed, and once they understand how simple evil is, they might get bored with those problems and change how they think/feel
        - these graphs are useful on their own but more useful as a set and when completed and when applied in a realistic simulation of a system with agents/incentives/groups/resources (it will look like a simplified visualization of reality but with 'social group/impact/status graphs' and 'resource graphs' as graph layers/components and so on), then it can create a really good economy/society optimization graph/algorithm/simulation set

    - graph of languages/concepts to simplify the language so people can think more clearly

    - graph of mental models/biases to avoid errors like assumptions

    - graph of flaws and how to solve them like a 'joke about the flaw' to avoid being harmed by it so people arent as easily controlled by compliments/insults and are less emotional bc theyve already read the insults/compliments so theyre not surprised by them (surprising status changes cause emotions), or other solutions of how to not be controlled by flaws (think more, care more, have other variables that are relevant)

    - graph of possible utopias/futures/worlds/societies so people can think about those more and so these are likelier to be optimized/achieved

    - graph of 'base truths' to prove or re-iterate important truths that shouldnt be debated to fight misinformation (health facts shouldnt be debated so a graph to connect health facts with reason/cause to help prove them is useful to avoid dangerous health misinformation, whereas other facts are debatable/uncertain/unimportant/irrelevant so they shouldnt be included in 'indisputable important fact graphs')


Useful websites/databases

    - website for govts to chat and organize/coordinate/share solutions
        - website for 'feelings govts', 'status govts', 'intelligence govts', 'flaw govts', and other govts that rule society to organize/coordinate
        - website to share only the most useful solutions (to make sure everyone sees them, like my graphs/insights/ideas) or an email service that makes sure everyone sees these useful graphs/insights/ideas so that everyone has the same understanding/grasp of meaning to generate consensus

    - website for problems/solution indexing/listing, matching and sharing (for example, the list of health problems/solution herbs in cancer.md, which is useful in a text editor program with highlighting so they can see how many conditions turmeric helps prevent, or a similar spreadsheet/website with similarly useful functionality)
        - website to submit specific problems or requests for solutions (like a request for a specific graph that would help them solve problems)
        - website to have contests with prize money to solve problems (like 'find a policy/consensus algorithm that represents groups democratically')
            - relatedly to consensus generation, https://changingminds.org/techniques/general/overall/marwell_schmitt_strategies.htm - "Marwell and Schmitt's Compliance-Gaining Strategies"

    - website to identify and kill predators with cameras/drones, as a predator-hunting game for a volunteer/community-based gaming police force, with tips on how to identify predators or integrated police databaase data to help track their locations in real time



Useful algorithms

    - algorithm that implements 'optimal transport' (or similar algorithm types/intents) to identify what resources there are and how those resources can be distributed fairly to fulfill common intents (like 'basic human needs' and 'universal human rights'), given resources like 'info/laws/religions/taxes/groups/investments/debts/predictions/markets/incentives/demand/probabilities/certainties/oil/privacy/police force/organization/interest rates/etc'
        - algorithm/graph to predict supply/demand decades in advance as well as optimization opportunities and technologies to improve future supply/demand
            - https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/16/global-water-crisis-food-production-at-risk
        - by the way, regarding 'algorithms to match supply/demand', 'predicting demand' involves 'predicting queries', so queries are a useful data source to apply as an input to an 'algorithm to match supply/demand', and same for 'methods to change demand' (methods to change what people want, as in their queries, as in causal/determining variables of queries like problems/alternatives)

    - algorithm that identifies 'better societal organization structures or better societal states (different utopias/futures/worlds/cities/heavens)' and identifies 'how to connect the current state to that optimal future state' using 'optimal transport' (or similar algorithm types/intents)

            - problem/solution identification models to identify new problems/solutions
        
        - human interaction optimization functions
            - optimize social interactions in a way that benefits all grouos (would identify policies like 'remote work' as an optimal strategy to prevent in-person conflicts for example)
                - this can identify useful social rule sets/networks like 'optimal killing rules' (like the fairest killing rules, like 'try to help them first, then try to leave, then if they still burden you, then you can kill them')
            - optimizing economic/market interactions in a way that benefits economic participants (identifies policies like 'move people to cities to increase economic opportunities', identifies 'new institutions or governance structures')
                - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2840637
            - model to estimate interface data like the 'cost' of a 'change' (like the 'cost of passing/implementing/enforcing a law')
            - health models/graphs
                - health optimizing model (identifies policies like 'use an air purifier' or 'move out of a polluted city' as a health intervention for cancer patients or patients with high probability of cancer)
                - drug-finding model for new 'drug-related intents' to identify useful medicines for unsolved health conditions (drugs to deal with emotions like jealousy so you dont kill geniuses, drugs to increase hedonic tone without increasing sex drive, drugs to prevent inflammation without causing other conditions, drugs to make retards smart, drugs to help people get rid of their addictions like addictions to burdening/bullying/violating people or addictions to not thinking, drugs to clear blood of pfas/pollution/other bad substances better than a healthy diet/exercise can, etc)
                - graph of bio-system causal networks so patients can identify what a supplement/diet/medicine/lifestyle change will do to those variables to help 'identify optimal treatments from a list of possible treatments and also to identify better understanding of the bio-system such as identifying new variables/connections/optimizations', and a graph to identify the intents/variables that need changing and how they need to be changed for treating a condition
                - graph to optimize the bio-system (by 'identifying genes that can be removed without impacting other variables negatively', for example)
                - graph to identify relevant explanations/causes of bio-system 'uncertainty as in unexplained variation' (identifying 'microrna and eccdna and other structures of dna' with adjacent info like 'info about dna/rna', which can continue identifying adjacent insights to identified info)
                - graph to optimize drug selections to 'optimize filtering of solution sets' (for example, identifying the drug that fulfills a 'higher count of positive intents', compared to another drug with similar functionality, once a set of solution/optimal drugs is found for a condition)
                - 'diagnostic graph of substances/interventions as tests for conditions' and 'treatment graph of substances/interventions connected to conditions connected to solution intents and specific implementation structures of intents (like genes)' and other 'core function/interface graphs'

            - oracle model to perform high-scale/iteration predictions for society (will identify general societal patterns like 'society is too oriented to humiliation/torture/exploitation which benefits only predators/parasites and causes innocent suffering, start thinking independently more to avoid a torture society that will self-destruct and descend into anarchy/chaos')
            - model to integrate all the predictions/advice generated by the other human interaction models to avoid contradictory advice and feed these integrations as inputs to other models (like 'if people act on the advice of these models, what new things will I need to warn them about')
            - model (or llm query) to analyze biases (identifying jealousy, lies, racism, etc)

            - thought/feeling optimizing models
                - your thoughts have never been private, folks, especially if youve ever 'been similar to someone' or 'interacted with a smart person or even a functional person' bc thoughts arent that complicated, especially your 'urge thoughts created by your subconscious communicating with your body to find out what it wants/needs or is used to wanting/needing'
                - a better goal than 'keeping urges (what your body wants/needs) and thoughts (mental work) private' is learning how to create 'conditions for happiness' so more people are happy by default (have fewer wants/needs in the first place) and are more similar to each other in that they have fewer problems (their remaining wants/needs are solved), bc I realized the 'right thoughts to solve problems', so few people even 'have to have thoughts (do mental work) any more', and if they have thoughts, those thoughts will be about remaining unsolved problems, and if they have 'new desires/intents/urges' creating 'new problems', those will also likely be quickly solved with my 'right thoughts to solve problems'

                - what you can do rather than panicking about this tech is to not be scared of scrutiny but instead:
                    - publish your thoughts now and/or be able to defend/explain/connect your thoughts
                    - publish 'thought/emotion/want/need optimizing thoughts' like 'thought-generating thoughts' (rules to generate some useful type of thought, or to focus on a problem) to share solutions to thinking/feeling problems
                    - research drugs that optimize thoughts like focus drugs
                    - be around similar people, so youre not hated for your thoughts, bc theyll have similar thoughts, until you improve that group and its thoughts so you dont have to isolate/group together like that at all
                    - solve problems like I do, by identifying useful new rules/graphs to solve problems, if there are any remaining unsolved problems by my inventions
                        - solve specific relevant problems like removing emotions/wants/needs (urge thoughts), 'default reaction' thoughts, standard/useful thought connections/combinations/other interface structures of thoughts, and optimizing other remaining mental work that is unoptimized to solve remaining unconnected differences
                            - solving mental health disorders like depression/anxiety/etc, which are an input to 'emotions'
                            - solving for 'reducing/changing/removing/creating emotions', as an unnecessary process in a logical mind that can detect status changes and change behavior/thinking in useful ways without help from emotions
                            - 'reducing/changing/removing/creating wants/needs' or 'improving/optimizing brain/body communication to avoid the input for urge thoughts at all' so that urge thoughts like 'go get this food' arent necessary anymore bc the body solves problems in a different way than asking your conscious mind for a specific food (the bio-system becomes better at problem-solving, to get food from other sources like air nutrients, for example)
                            - next up is solving for removing 'default reaction thoughts' which are 'normal thoughts to have in response to something, given other previous experiences/thoughts/feelings'
