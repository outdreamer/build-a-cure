- the following are possible thefts of my inventions to examine
	- some of these may be artificially backdated to make it look published a long time before I was born, theyre probably adding my inventions to Harry Potter to make it look like I didnt invent anything
	- some may be useful only as examples of how stupid people are bc they didnt think it all the way through or realize the important thing to realize about the structure, as in how its relevant, or didnt sense variation
	- some of the thefts may be happening by accessing a hacked/mirrored copy of the data in my repo, like by hacking the github database or installing keyloggers on my laptop
	- some of the thefts may be happening by 'applying scripts I wrote or workflows I invented', like by 'generating combinations of interface structures' and 'selecting useful combinations' or 'applying changes to combinations of interface structures'
	- maybe/definitely dont have a strategy of 'copying the genius', 'every pedophile in the world', bc guess what is easy to identify once you copy my inventions? who, what, and where you are, 'every pedophile in the world'
	- I wish you all were stealing my inventions in an impressive way for once, rather than creating this horrific 'poorly copying' bullshit, do you need help stealing my inventions lol, I should have been polite and tried to teach you how to steal inventions as well as inventing the inventions, that would have been the polite thing wouldnt it? is it like, super mean of me to 'talk about my inventions' without 'helping all the pedophiles steal my inventions easier'? Im really mean then, if its mean to not help the pedophiles steal my inventions easier
	- it sucks that you have to read and copy my work to seem even slightly smart, all I have to do to seem smart is think for a few minutes bc I actually am smart
    - still not seeing that email notifying me that Ive received the $100 million dollars at least for all my inventions that OpenAI, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc stole for years, still waiting
    - hey folks, uhhh, hate to be rude again, wish I didnt have to be rude, uhhh, I have thousands of AI inventions that automate AI, problem-solving, inventing, math proofs, etc, whereas it seems like you have pedophilia by comparison, so Im going to keep being mean until I have my money for my inventions, or a really good job in a safe place where I can work on what I want and fix society
    - Id say 'best of luck to all the poop who steal my inventions, in hopes that you never have cause to encounter the bugs I may or may not have planted in my inventions to punish and expose you for stealing' if I didnt plan on destroying luck itself with the magic of organization created by my algorithms
    - this is legit hilarious, these people got hired/trusted to build/discuss AI by someone at some point, maybe I should just let people pretend to be geniuses by poorly copying me, it is insanely funny, maybe not actually bc when theyre allowed to pretend to be me, they always start believing their lies and try to kill me for getting real respect
    - are any of these poor copies of my work actually useful? (nope) or was it 'easily automated by trivial changes applied to my inventions' (yep)
    - hey folks? only stupid people have to steal or commit crimes, think about it for even just like one second, stupid people cant 'think of algorithms to get every deserving person everything they want thereby invalidating the need for crimes', whereas smart people can (thats why I invented 'algorithms to get every deserving person everything they want thereby invalidating the need for crimes', it means Im smart, see you were acting like a cockroach, 'only paying attention to simple physical structures around you within sight, and the tasks you were paid to do which you looked up the answers on how to solve or looked up smart people to copy/rob to avoid thinking, thinking short-term to avoid thinking, thinking about only a few irrelevant variables at a time to avoid thinking', which would never produce 'real intelligence or good decision-making or accurate analysis' bc reality is more complicated than a few variables/iterations/sequences/etc, and therefore someone who is 'acting like a cockroach' in this way ('minimizing their thinking') would never 'invent algorithms to get every deserving person everything they want thereby invalidating the need for crimes', whereas I realized that was what I should be working on and realized it was possible and that I was capable of it, so thats what I worked on, bc Im smart enough to see all of these things and understand them), so stop 'trying to harm me or slow me down or profit off of me' and start enabling me to work on this since Im the best at thinking and specifically this type of thinking, or at least get out of my way
    - the cockroach argument like 'steal as much as you can to build as quickly as possible' is only valid in a few cases, like where 'the product is really important, it doesnt harm society to build the product, it doesnt kill a genius to build the product in this exploitative way or there is no other way to build the important product and the product is necessary for the species to succeed' which doesnt apply in any real circumstances that I can think of, there is always another way, there is always a way to avoid crimes, there is never a product that important, there is never a requirement to abuse a genius into making a really important product bc a genius would naturally want to and you wouldnt have to abuse them in any way to get them to build it, and if the genius doesnt want to build that product, that means its not important to build that product, as it will only help swine/bugs rather than people, which may be important to swine/bugs but swine/bugs arent important to the universe or required for anyone to survive, I get to kill you, you dont get to kill me, if you think there is a 'requirement to abuse a genius into making a really important product', thats bc youre too stupid to think of an alternative, similar to how pedophiles cant 'think of a better alternative to pedophilia'
    - also the argument that 'we are incredibly brilliant, we just dont feel like inventing anything, as we are above caring at all' is obviously wrong as well, "smart people are capable of caring and do care bc its easy for them to solve problems created by caring like 'saving people'" and also 'caring/empathy is an intelligence/derivation tool to figure things out quicker', whereas 'stupid people have to try to not care to avoid doing any work like "thinking to solve problems to save people" bc they cant do that work of "thinking to solve problems to save people"' (meaning 'you dont have empathy BECAUSE youre stupid, as it requires extra mental functions/neurons to have it, bc it takes work') and a person who doesnt care about super important things like 'saving people' will also find it difficult to care about 'understanding reality' bc your body can technically survive by not understanding reality so youll tell yourself you 'dont have to care about understanding reality bc it doesnt impact you' but you wont be real or really alive at all and bad news for bad people, the universe doesnt need people like you who will infinitely fail to understand reality unless the understanding is 'one cockroach step away', which it will never be
    - also just assume that if I 'post a new insight that simplifies problem-solving', you dont need to 'try to use that insight try to feel smarter than me', bc chatgpt will probably be able to build a better tool using that insight than you could at this point, so you dont need to build yet another tool based on yet another simple obvious usage of that insight like every other creep did to try to feel smarter than me, we have plenty of very poor 'language to diagram' tools that are much worse than what chatgpt would build at this point, no thank you

- these are death threats generated by the people who call themselves 'geniuses for copying me very poorly and violating me online'
	- https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/09/intel-on-the-brink-of-death/
	- https://www.wheresyoured.at/godot-isnt-making-it/
	- these people keep threatening me (the person brave enough to talk about and think about how to solve pedophilia which is stupidity until she succeeds) with a 'downfall' or a 'fall from grace' for 'hating violation', what could possibly be any clearer in terms of 'who to get rid of' (its the people who hate that brave smart happy hot person who loves solving problems)

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model) - transformers use 'connections between items in a sequence' which is like a 'flattened network' (into a sequence format), applying the insight that 'non-adjacent connections' are likely to be more useful than 'adjacent unit connections (of size 1)' for determining interactivity of a 'phrase/clause/sentence' with 'other phrases/clauses/sentences', applying the structure of 'incompleteness' of the 'adjacent connections' in determining these interactions
