# solution automation systematization (interface analysis applied to problem/solution structures)

There are many variables determining solution automation & interface analysis, such as:
	- problem-solving intents (like 'filter a solution space')
	- problem structures (like the 'problem types' or 'problem space allowing the problem to occur')
	- solution structures (like 'solutions' or 'solution metrics or requirements')
	- solution automation workflows (like 'trial & error')
	- structures used in solution automation workflows, interaction structures, or interface queries
		- functions (like 'find' or 'connect')
		- interfaces (like 'change' or 'potential' or 'intent')
		- problem/solution structures (like 'solution success cause' or 'error structures')
		- interface structures (and specifically useful interface structures) (like 'optimization', 'cross-interface', or 'trade-off' structures)
	- various interface query implementation variables (like 'origin interface that the query starts from')

These variables fit together according to various rules (like 'rules describing how various function types fit together for different intents or for interaction layers').

Some example solutioin automation variable configuration for various relevant functions, attributes & structures follows, followed by some example solution automation workflow variables (some of which was referenced in other applications).


Solution automation variable fit summary
	
	1. problem/solution structures

		- solution structures like solution metrics & error structures like error types are useful as components of solution automation workflows
			- 'solution metrics' are used in the 'filter a solution space' problem-solving intent of some solution automation workflows
			- 'error types' are used in the 'avoid errors' problem-solving intent of some solution automation workflows

	2. interfaces

		- primary interfaces like cause/intent/change
		- specific interfaces of a problem space (like how 'intelligence', 'incentives', 'experience', & 'decisions' are specific interfaces in an agent-based system)
		- specific problem-solving interfaces like 'useful structures' or 'insights'
		- specific attribute interfaces like 'interactivity' or 'consistency' or 'balance'
	
	3. useful structures

		- general useful interface structures
			- 'generative functions'
			- 'alternate routes'

		- useful structures of solution automation workflow variables
			- 'generative functions' of 'solution automation workflows'
			- 'generative functions' of 'solution success cause'

	4. solution automation workflows
		
		- example: 'break a problem into sub-problems & merge sub-solutions'
		- insight paths & other relevant structures to workflows (insight paths include all workflows which 'make finding solutions easier', but insight paths generally 'make finding insights/info easier' in some way)
			- 'apply cross-system insight patterns to other systems to predict insights'
		- interface queries
			- 'apply causal interface to identify cause of problem and solve alternate problem of "reducing problem cause"'
	
	5. solution automation workflow attributes
		
		- inputs
			- 'solution success cause'
				- 'inputs to info like certainties/energy can be used to generate other info'
		
		- position
			- 'related object (workflow) network fit'
				- 'generalization of a workflow'

	6. functions

		A. general functions ('find', 'build', 'apply', 'derive', 'mean', 'cause', 'intend')
			
			- these are associated with primary interfaces:
				- find/info, build/core, apply/change, derive/logic, mean/meaning, cause/cause, intend/intent

		B. core interaction functions & interaction structures ('connect', 'combination')

		C. interim cross-interface functions ('organize', 'standardize')

			- these connect other functions, specifically connecting general functions with interfaces & core interaction functions
				- 'organize': '"find" interface structures "structures" that apply the core interaction function "fit" in a way that fulfills solution metric "consistency"'

		D. general problem-solving intent functions (not all intents need to be fulfilled for a given workflow, sometimes fulfilling one intent is enough to qualify as a solution automation workflow if implemented in the right way)
		
			- 'filter solution space'
			- 'relate problem to other problems'
		

Solution automation variable fit details

	- in general:

		- these variables should be able to generate each other once defined
			- 'interfaces & the structures/operations defined for them' should be able to generate 'solution automation workflows'
			- 'functions' should be able to generate 'interfaces'
			- 'problem/solution structures' can generate 'solution automation workflows' bc applying structure to a problem/solution makes it increasingly trivial to solve in cases that can be identified by their structure (like 'connection' structures connecting problem/solution structures, leading to the 'connect problem/solution structures' workflow)
		
		- the variants of each variable should also be able to generate the other variants
			- a particular solution automation workflow should be able to solve the problem of 'generating another solution automation workflow'
			- 'problem-solving intent functions' should be able to generate 'general functions' or 'core interaction functions'

		- these variables can generally interact with each other using any interaction function, with particularly useful interactions including:
			- functions can be 'components' of solution automation workflows
			- solution automation workflows can be 'components' of functions (indicating that a workflow should be applied to generate that component)
			- solution automation workflows can be 'inputs' of solution automation workflows
			- structures are 'subsets' of interfaces
			- structures are 'alternate formats' of functions

		- general fit of functions

			- in between the general functions (find/generate/apply/mean) and the core interaction functions (connect, reduce, break, filter), there is an interim level of function interactions that sync with the interface query interaction level (identify, select, cause, standardize, organize, integrate)
				
				- similarity in interaction levels indicates various connections across these hierarchies

					- solution automation workflows ('filter solutions by what structures are not known errors'), having various general problem-solving intents ('filter solutions', 'differentiate solutions from errors')
						- interim functions ('compare/select solutions')
							- structural core interaction functions ('check if a solution is equal/similar to an error')

					- interface ('system')
						- interface structures ('conflict')
							- interface structures on other interfaces ('intersection' or 'diverging direction' or 'resource inequality' on the structural interface)
			
					- hierarchy connections
						- interim functions often use interface structures like contradictions bc interface structures represent interim structures between the abstract concept defining the interface (like cause or logic) and the structures in other systems that correspond to that interface's structures

				- general problem-solving intents for solving info problems
					- the general functions represent general intents fulfilling the structure 'information existence' (in order for info to exist from the perspective of the program, you have to find/derive/generate it)
				
				- specific problem-solving intent functions
					- functions like 'filter solution space' are interactions between structural core interaction functions and problem/solution structures
				
				- the interim functions connect the general & core interaction functions
					- 'organize' is the connecting function between the general function 'mean' and the structural function 'position'
					- 'integrate' is the connecting function between the general function 'mean' and the structural function 'merge'
					- these interim functions can be used to design interface queries to fulfill solution automation workflow core interaction functions involving general functions, if they dont use specific structural core interaction functions
						- example:
							- a solution automation workflow like 'find the meaning of a structure and check if it invalidates other meanings or is consistent as a way of finding possible structures to solve a problem in that system' has an interface query involving 'organize or integrate the structure with other structures to see if a contradiction can be created'

				- structural interaction functions
					- the core interaction functions fulfill common structural intents, not just common to problem/solution interactions but common in general
				
				- solution automation workflow functions
					- solution automation workflows are interaction structures of specific problem-solving intent functions
						- a workflow may fulfill the general problem-solving intent function 'filter solution space'
				
				- interface query functions
					- interface queries are interaction structures of interaction structures to fulfill a function intent (interim functinos, general problem-solving intents, solution automation workflow intents, core interaction functions, etc)
						- 'apply the "structure interface" to fulfill the "connect" core interaction function of the solution automation workflow "connect problem/solution structures"'
						- this calls the 'build' function (to create a 'connection' structure), which is fulfilled by calling the 'apply function' on an 'interface' structure
						- this is an 'embedded' interaction structure, where one interaction structure (apply) is embedded in another (build)
					- interface queries are an 'interaction structure of interaction structures' because they connect solution automation workflows with structural core interaction functions 
						- interface queries are a 'structural implementation' of a solution automation workflow

			- all functions use the general functions ('find') or a sub-function of them on some interaction level, whether its an interim level between general/structure functions (organize/standardize) or structural level ('filter')

	1. problem/solution structures

		- these are a reason to use the other structures ('bc a problem exists, there is a reason to apply workflows to find a solution')
		- these structures are found in solution automation workflows which are specifically defined to fulfill useful interactions of problems/solutions

	2. interfaces like the following are useful bc they add value in their potential to find/derive/generate info, and are components of other workflow variables

		- 'primary interfaces'such as cause/intent/change' can be components of other workflow variables bc they are fundamentally useful concepts with high-variation, that can act as structures/functions
			- 'change a standard solution until it fulfills solution metrics' is a solution automation workflow that involves the 'change' interface
			- 'change the logic steps of a function until it matches function intent' is a specific function involving the 'change' & 'intent' interfaces
			- 'structures of change' on an interface like 'intent' are useful bc knowing how structures like 'intent sequences' change is useful for predicting their future states & interactions & outputs
		- 'specific interfaces of a problem space' can be useful bc interface operations governing interface interactions can be used to predict their interactions
		- 'specific problem-solving interfaces like "useful structures" or "insights"' are useful by definition & relevance to problem-solving
		- 'specific attribute interfaces like "interactivity"' are useful bc these offer a connection across interfaces to enable efficient interface queries, if these attributes are adjacently applied to input structures

	3. useful structures

		- general useful interface structures
			- 'generative functions' are useful bc they apply structure to a primary interface ('cause'), to create structures that are useful for other intents like 'generating a structure', 'finding a structure', 'solving a problem cause'
			- 'alternate routes' are useful bc they apply structure to a primary interface ('change'), to create structures that are useful for other intents like 'connect'

		- useful structures of solution automation workflow variables
			- useful structures of variables related to solution automation workflows are by definition useful for problem-solving automation intents
				- 'generative functions' of 'solution automation workflows' are useful where a new solution automation workflow is required or other workflows can be improved for a particular problem
				- 'generative functions' of 'solution success cause' are useful to identify causes of solution success for use as a filter of solutions or a way to generate default probably successful solution structures like requirements

	4. solution automation workflows
		
		- solution automation workflows are useful bc they connect input problem info in the form of 'missing info' with a solution that provides that missing info in a particular format, and they execute that connection using structures, allowing specific implementations to be constructed that solve the problem
		- the specific nature of these workflows adds value in guiding the implementation of the workflow, reducing the work required in solving the problem (in the form of reducing the decisions that need to be made, by specifying which structures to apply & fulfill)

	5. solution automation workflow attributes

		- descriptive attributes of workflows
			- solution automation workflows can be described in terms of their:
				- relation to other workflows (how they fit with other workflows, as in how to generate them by applying conversions to other workflows)
				- standard variations (generalization, simplification)
				- start/end point of the workflow (which interface the workflow starts from)

		- generative variables creating workflows
			- any structures that can generate interactions that find/derive/generate info can generate solution automation workflows
				- this includes other solution automation workflows, which can be used to generate other solution automation workflows by applying conversions to them in ways that dont invalidate the problem-solving functionality

		- input variables determining differences across workflows
			- workflows depend on some requirements, like:
				- relevant structures/formats
				- problem/solution structures
				- general problem-solving intents
				- functions including general functions, interim functions & core interaction functions/structures
				- interfaces

			- the core abstract function represented (is it a find method, an apply method, a combination)
			- the models used (object model, interface query)
			- unstructured/uncertain information

	6. functions

		A. general functions are used for 'info existence' intents

			- before other functions can be applied, info has to exist (it has to be found, derived, generated, have structure from changes applied to other existing info, or have meaning in order to exist)
				- these functions can be used to find/derive/generate/apply/mean info in:
					- an interface query:
						- a problem type like 'find structures to solve an "info asymmetry" problem type'
						- a specific problem like 'find a structure'
					- a solution automation workflow:
						- problems in general like 'find info to solve info problems'
						- problems in a particular general format like 'find a function' or 'avoid errors' or 'find connections'
					- any function that finds/derives/generates/defines/applies info:
						- 'find a string matching another string'
						- 'find a solution having this attribute'

			- these functions are interchangeable
				- different general functions can be applied to solve a problem, like 'find a prediction function'
				- find: 'find a prediction function'
				- apply: 'apply changes to prediction function interface structures like prediction function patterns or components until the target prediction function is reached'
				- derive: 'apply interface structures like limits/requirements/errors to derive a prediction function, given what a prediction function is not'
				- generate: 'apply components of prediction functions to build a prediction function by combining/merging components of prediction functions'
				- mean: 'define the meaning of a prediction function (absolutely or in a given context) and filter possible prediction functions based on this definition'
		
		B. core interaction functions & structures ('connect', 'combination') can be used to specify/structure the implementation of a function

			- using specific interaction functions/structures creates a specific structural intent to fulfill when implementing a function
				
				- 'connect a problem/solution' is more specific & structural than 'relate a problem/solution', so using 'connect' is useful to get all the useful info associated with the 'connect' function, like:
					- the definitions of how it can interact with other objects, any related logic already defined for the function, clarity in how it can be applied
						- the definition of 'connect' implies a sequence of conversions linking states of the input/output, so applying it to a problem/solution indicates that the problem can be connected with the solution using a sequence of conversions
						- this provides a specific structure to look for (a 'sequence of conversion functions'), which is useful info for fulfilling the 'connect' intent & implementing the function
					- what its useful for, what inputs it can use & what outputs it can produce
						- 'connect' is useful for intents like 'equate', when objects should be equated bc theyre different by default (a problem is different from a solution)
						- 'connect' has outputs like a 'sequence of conversions/states/formats' and the target output (in this case, the target output is the 'solution')
			
			- this is generally useful for generating any function automatically

				- a requirement to generate functions may occur in an interface query, where sub-problems & corresponding sub-solution intents are identified, and a new function may need to be implemented automatically to fulfill that sub-problem-solving intent
				
				- example: if a component of an interface query such as the intent 'find the cause of a structure' is not an existing function, a function will need to be implemented automatically to fulfill that intent in the interface query
					- an example of how this would be implemented is a sub-interface query implementing a solution automation workflow that would be called by this interface query if a function is not found for this intent, to solve the problem of 'missing info' in the form of a 'missing function'
						- sub-problem: 'missing info of a function to connect cause & structure'
							- sub-problem: 'missing info about cause'
								- apply the 'connect problem/solution' solution automation workflow
									- output:
										- function to connect cause & info about cause: 
											- 'connect' 'definition' with 'cause'
							- sub-problem: 'missing info about the connection between cause & structure'
								- apply the 'connect problem/solution' solution automation workflow
									- output: 
										- function to connect cause & structure: 
											- 'connect' 'definition' of 'cause' with 'structure'
						- sub-problem: 'missing info about specific cause of the original problem structure'
							- apply function output by the query above to 'connect definition of cause with structure' to the 'specific structure' in the original problem
								- output:
									- 'specific cause' of 'specific structure' in original problem

		C. interim functions are useful for being general enough to allow variation in specific implementations of general useful intents like 'organize' or 'standardize', while still differentiating these interim functions to identify useful intents in implementing 'info existence' intents

			- 'organize' helps with the general intent of 'info having meaning' (mean), but doesnt specify exactly how to organize info, allowing for variation in implementation according to which structures/functions would optimally implement it in a given usage context
				- the variables to this function would include how to fulfill sub/related intents of 'organize' like 'merge', 'fit', 'connect'

			- 'standardize' helps with the general intent of 'finding info like differences' (find), but doesnt specific exactly how to standardize info
				- the variables to this function would include which interface to standardize to, and how to fulfill sub/related intents of 'standardize', like 'define', 'structure', 'identify', 'differentiate', 'connect'

			-  given that general functions like 'find'/'apply' fulfill all ways to solve info problems (which are fundamentally 'missing info' problems in some way), and that core interaction structures/functions add value in the form of specific structures to guide function implementation, combining these can fulfill useful interim functions like 'organize'/'standardize' which have many ways to implement them, but are less abstract than general functions & less specific than core interaction structures/functions
			
			- these interim functions may be used in any workflow components, but are especially likely to be used in:

				- solution automation workflows, as generally useful functions that add value in the info they can create

				- interface queries, as more abstract functions to implement in a specific way that is useful for solving that particular problem, which aligns with the structure of an interface query
			
				- interface-enabling functions, so these interim functions would be part of the interface query to implement a function like 'apply/define an interface' (if they didnt rely on those functions as inputs)
					- 'apply a standard', which fulfills interim intents like 'standardize' in a specific way ('apply an interface as a standard')
					- 'define a standard', which fulfills interim intents like 'organize/integrate' in a specific way ('organize & integrate structures required to structure/define the specific concept creating a standard like "cause"')

		D. general problem-solving intents like 'filter a solution space' can be created from particularly useful general/interim/interaction structures/functions applied to problem/solution structures, useful as determined by the problem/solution structure definitions which indicate how they would optimally interact

			- 'filter a problem space' isnt as useful as 'filter a solution space' for general problem-solving processes, bc 'filtering a solution space' has an output of a 'solution' by definition of what a 'filter' and 'solution space' are, whereas 'filtering a problem space' wouldnt necessarily have this output
			- 'relate problem to other problems' is useful in case solutions to related problems are available, as a source of initial solutions to test, which is useful for some solution automation workflows
