Invention Title: Other Solution Automation & Interface Analysis Implementations

ABSTRACT 

Solution automation & interface analysis components can be implemented in many ways, such as by specifying input/outputs & training a learning (generate, test & update) algorithm on the input/output data to generate a prediction function, to replace code connecting input & outputs. 

Alternatively, additional specific example structure (like code/configuration/data) implementations to connect input/outputs of sub-tasks like core interaction functions & problem-solving intents to implement solution automation & interface analysis are included in the specification of this invention.
