ABSTRACT

Solution automation & interface analysis components can be implemented in many ways, such as by specifying input/outputs & training a learning (generate, test & update) algorithm on the input/output data to generate a prediction function, to replace logic connecting input & outputs. Alternatively, specific logic implementations to connect input/ output of sub-tasks to implement solution automation & interface analysis are included in the specification of this invention.
