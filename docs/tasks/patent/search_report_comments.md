	- date of international search report: 04/23/2021
	- general comments
		- 'apply AI to connect all inputs/outputs' is a method of 'connecting inputs/outputs', but it's absolutely not a novel method and it's certainly not equivalent to my invention, which offers an alternative to replace AI
	- errors
		- certain claims were found unsearchable
			- dependent claims 7, 16, 25 were not drafted in accordance with rule 6.4a, second & third sentences

					- this seems like a standard recommender system with many manual processes involving a standard question-answer pattern-identification & prioritized-ranking algorithm which is a common solution to the 'matching search query with results' problem

	- general comments
		- nearly every program involves an equivalence check of some sort, where an explicit data type check or an implicit state/process check or other input metric
			- 'having an equivalence check' that doesnt make it equivalent to my method of 'comparing any structure with any other structure after standardizing it to a custom primary interface which is a standardizing filter with a special meaning that indicates it can be used to solve any problem', but I understand why someone who isnt good at comparing things would have trouble identifying the difference between the two
		- none of these programs do anything other than:
			- apply machine-learning algorithms to identify patterns, generate content, identify entites in unstructured data, etc
			- apply known existing functions to process data, for example to create summaries of data with a 'summarize' function or identify topics/entities in data with an 'identify entities' or 'identify topics' function
			- apply input-output function sequences of known existing functions, which can be replaced with a sql select statement & an iteration of the results to create a nested list connecting inputs/outputs
		- my invention provides a method to automate problem-solving by applying solution structures like interface queries, which use interfaces ('standardizing filters that make comparison of inputs trivial', so that problem/solution structures can be compared & connected)
