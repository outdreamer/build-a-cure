    - specific problems

          - hamiltonian path
            - apply 'subset' structure:
              - create sub-structures of paths
            - apply 'combination' structure:
              - create combinations of sub-structures of paths
            - apply 'equivalence' filter
              - remove combinations of sub-structures of paths that include a duplicate node
            - apply 'interactive' filter
              - remove combinations of sub-structures of paths that arent interactive (adjacent connections)
            - apply 'contradiction' filter
              - remove combinations of sub-structures of paths that contradict original structure to traverse

          - the fundamental question of p vs np is 'are all ambiguities resolvable' meaning 'is there a structure that can resolve any ambiguity'
            - find counterexample of an ambiguity that is not resolvable (not calculatable, no matter how much info or understanding you have, no matter how many alternatives you can rule out, or how many other filters you can apply)

          - mass gap: 'quantum particles have positive masses, even though the classical waves travel at the speed of light'
            - "gauge theory is a type of field theory in which the Lagrangian (system change descriptor using coordinates & time derivatives, or potential - kinetic energy) does not change (is invariant) under local transformations from certain Lie groups (continuous groups where points can be multiplied/inverted with smooth/differentiable results)"
            - "Lagrangian density is a function of the fields in the system & their derivatives & possibly the space/time coordinates themselves, where the independent variable is an event in spacetime (x, y, z, t) or more generally a point s on a manifold"
            - "action of output variables = integral of [density of (output variables, output variable derivatives, and event as a point on a manifold) * the measure of the domain of the field function]"
              - calculate action given operations like density on variables, their derivatives & an event (point on a manifold)
            - "density is a section of a density line bundle (lines created by varying points, like tangent bundle), 
              where the density bundle contains volumes assigned to the shape created by x's tangent vectors"
            - "Lagranian: function that describes the state of a dynamic system using position coordinates & their time derivatives, which is equal to the difference between the potential & kinetic energy"

            - the local transformations from the lie group dont change the difference in potential/kinetic energy even if it changes their values, and it doesnt change the change rates connecting points
            - this is like how quantum particles may keep the atom constant, despite local transformations
              - where else do structures of alternatives produce equivalent outputs?
                - in functions like elliptic curves/wave/circular functions, where ambiguities lie in alternative inputs with similar/equal outputs
                - do these functions benefit from conversion to another 'multi-input for equivalent/similar output' function?
                - what attribute/structures generates the attribute of structural similarities in outputs of alternate paths? 
                  - is there a containing/limit structure, or an efficient interaction structure, or a core component structure generating these structural similarities
            - do quantum particles produce neutralization structures of mass when moving at different speeds
            - do their quantum fields aggregate into a wave under certain conditions, while the non-aggregated components retain mass with efficient interaction structures that can store energy with temporary certainty structures
            - what is the function of quantum particles - are they just generative or descriptive info of the particle output by the particle's structure, or indicators of lack of info about the particle, or differences between info about the particle

    - some systems like quantum physics may seem to defy structurization bc they generate structure (info) on demand from whatever resources (like adjacent energy/charge) are available, rather than from a consistent set of resources in a consistent pattern or with consistent rules, by using different versions of objects & functions like references & patterns rather than specific objects & functions themselves - but the structures generated are somewhat predictable in their interchangeability with each other (alternates having some attributes in common) and coordination with boundary/limit/invalidating structures, so finding alternative structures that coordinate with the surrounding structures is one way of reducing the solution space & assigning probability

      - the bootstrap is just an iterative 'point subset connecting function'
      - insight path to generate idea of 'adding quantum fields to identify value probability at a position'
        - apply aggregation function to find relative info about a value in a position (compared to info about values in other positions) in standardizable/mappable sets (like fields having some value in the same positions across fields)
        - problem format: many fields with values in each position
        - solution format: value for each position
        - structures that could connect them the problem & solution formats
          - value-aggregation or value-set description functions like add (for a standard compare to relative values in other positions, given pre-existing input standard already applied to position) or average (to find expected value if each field was equally likely, which may not be the case)
          - functions that convert a value set into an individual value (example functions, average functions)
          - comparison functions (across values in a set and relative values in a field)

      - other ways to generate the idea:
        - find patterns in point subset connection patterns & generalize to field connection patterns
        - apply a filter of identifying patterns of probability-hoarding points (aggregating the most probability) given interaction structures leading to higher probabilities and assign lower values to remaining points without calculating every point
        - apply interaction structures between adjacent probability distributions, similarities like adjacence, infinities, or aggregation/neutralization structures to identify structures with higher probabilities
          - the reason an aggregation is useful in smoe cases as opposed to an average is bc of the lack of interactivity across fields, meaning the fields dont influence each other and the concept of an average value is valid bc the items are produced independently from each other, so we can apply structures related to randomness like an average (which is the value if each value in the original value set was 'equally probable')
        - each field may not be equally likely, so an average of the field value for a certain position may not be relevant/useful
          - the function used to find one value for a value set needs to be relevant, given the interaction structures of the components that are inputs to the function (the intents of the actual interactions & the interactions in the function need to align)
          - the reason adding them works in some cases is bc the probability of fields that when summed, exactly neutralize each other to form an output field with a random distribution invalidating the idea of evaluating/comparing values on that field is highly unlikely, even restricted by definition of the infinite fields
            - what is the probability distribution of the sums or other interaction structures of fields

      - questions about qft
        - what are the weights applied to aggregated quantum fields? is it adjacence, average (adjacence to center), or some other similarity
          - is it the emergent interactions of probable interactive structures given interaction functions (like connection/neutralization/opposite/fit functions) & their inputs (like position), across related fields (how are they related)
          - are weights applied based on info that survives these interactions bc it has stabilized & isnt contradicted by most interaction types (lack of opposite structures invalidating stabilization)
        - what physical interaction structures of probability (quantum field, superposition, quantum particles) interact with physical structures of certainty (electron, position, velocity) & in what direction (causes or is generated by)
        - what probability structures like adjacence are relevant inputs to info aggregation/emergence
        - what math probability structures (impossibility, requirement, probability distribution, range, randomness) are interactive to create which stability/aggregation/emergence structures
        - how do absolute/abstract unlimited structures like infinities interact with specific/limit/definition structures like position?
        - how do infinite series interact with other infinite series?
          - can you reduce infinite series to formats like:
            - a set of distortions from an adjacent standard series
            - a set of lacks rather than a set of numbers (if it had these components, it would collapse into a function)
            - a description of other infinite sequences that reduce/limit the potential size/range/distribution of another infinite series bc of adjacence or interaction with the other infinite series
        - can you calculate descriptive attributes of an infinite series by the amount of storage it uses relative to other series, or the patterns of storage as the sequence is randomly traversed
          - how to calculate convergence without sequentially iterating series (identifying common connection patterns between point pairs, like connections by a certain coefficient/exponent pattern)
        - did the fourth dimension of time develop to store energy that couldnt be stored in three dimensions (storing info as energy/info probability structures instead of physical energy/info structures like electrons)
        - what other dimension structures would store other excess energy, in what formats?
          - time adds the possibility of 'state changes' to structures that can vary between adjacent states
            - or it takes away the possibility of change by following physics rules of change to structures instead of remaining in a probability state, 
              - giving the illusion that time has passed but really a certainty has just been applied to create the state changes as expected
              - where actual change indicating actual time indicates an addition of potential (adding a dimension of possible change)
            - are state chnages (time) resulting from input rules/attributes like stability/efficiency of info in a particular state trajectory?
          - are there structures that can vary across non-adjacent states?
          - what determines adjacence/probability of states?
          - can you change to non-adjacent states using different probability structures than adjacence/similarity?
          - what would be able to store excess energy that time cannot handle (is probability a dimension that stores energy like time stores energy)
          - do state changes (time) allocate energy according to which states can handle/preserve it?
          - if you design a state that can store energy better than your current state, how do you deploy that state change (design particles that store energy better than quantum particles and deploy a function to convert them) or introduce it to current energy storage so it self-migrates (make it adjacent)?
          - do the existing energy storage methods have priorities (like self-maintenance), are they unaware of environment context or unable to communicate/send energy?
          - what formats can existing energy storage methods already convert between?
          - can energy storage methods attract components with energy-storage optimization intents/potential like brains to store themselves as math function info rather than preserving their state
          - do energy storage devices like brains have potential energy to add extra dimensions than time
          - what weighting mechanism can be applied to state changes (time) to identify the true complete structure with time (state changes) removed
          - do structures that have excess energy necessarily stabilize over state changes to distribute their energy across state changes (time)
            - can changing state change trajectory change probability structures (like probability distribution) of the structure's energy
          - is there a structure whose energy cant be distributed across time (it cannot be completely described with state changes in 3 physical dimensions)

      - quantum physics specifically will benefit from de-observation through interface analysis, to find the standardized (like averaged) perception rather than the measured one in isolation of measurement perspective bias
        - this can involve deriving the errors in observation from the observation context's error structures, and removing those errors, distorting them until theyre not technically errors, or weighting them with other perspectives' errors
        - 'overlap/union field' as a convolution of observation position perspective & a structure
      - gaps in describability (created by structures like combinations of indescribabilities) using existing description tools are where uncertainties will often be located, for various reasons/causes
        - measurement might stabilize energy into a structure suboptimally, taking energy away from it, which opposes the purpose of maintaining an uncertainty (to store more energy, more efficiently for some metrics, without having to maintain a particular structure)
      - alternative info formats
        - rather than structurizing info, they can focus on structurizing info probability and relative info
          - 'the probability of info' like electron position emerging from this structure (or lack of structure) in this position is higher relative to this position
          - 'relative info' as a way of determining info likely to be in a position or produced at a position, given the probabilities of info in that structure and the relative info & info probabilities adjacent to & influencing its info probabilities
            - info doesnt exist or develop in a vacuum, it develops given the context of attributes like:
              - surrounding info
              - info probabilities
              - other info causes than adjacence & patterns, such as stability (info as an energy format that has achieved enough stability to achieve structure)
          - info formatted as a field or symmetry around a unit of energy (similar to a variable & its probability distribution), where the field or symmetry is generated by the possible info that can be generated with respect to time, and is governed by forces similar to gravity/magnetism in the form of interactivity & relevance
          - info formatted as a sequence of causes, like 'a lack of structures preventing it' or 'an overlap of not-info structures' (rather than info structures)
          - info formatted as structures of certainty like inevitabilities or requirements or interactivity
          - info formatted as a reflection of physical forces interacting & their energy outputs
          - info formatted as an error of absolute position or isolation (as opposed to relative position) assigned to forces' outputs
            - the idea of describing info is self-invalidating without including:
              - the other outputs of the forces in question
              - the position of the info on the time-based symmetry of the energy unit, which is what may really differentiate it from other related outputs (which may otherwise be equal, so its irrelevant to differentiate them without this attribute)
              - the position of this particular info relative to the other outputs 
              doesnt fit the concept of 'description'
              - the distortion on the symmetry of the energy unit relative to distortions on equal, adjacent or otherwise related energy units as a source of balance/equilibrium for a field of related energy units
          - info formatted as interactivity with or similarity/difference from other info 
            - is a quantum superposition a useful energy format bc it stores many difference types or bc it removes info from the original info or does it keep all original info in its interactions (like storing a thought structure through circulation rather than leaving in a neural structure?
            - what 'an energy unit's position can be' is something that can be described by its similarity/difference to other info, or even equivalence to other info if there are info alternatives, interchangeables, substitutes, approximations, or proxies that are sufficient to replace the info
            - a variable formatted as a set of distortions from other variables, leading to the development of the isolated variable capturing a difference type
            - a 'continuous function' as a description of a field connecting core units of difference (the smallest possible difference, leading to a connection as it becomes equivalent to an equivalence)
              - an equivalence between two components must always have some degree of falsehood bc there is no real equivalence possible between two components (one always has at least some difference to the other, even if its just position or probability of existing given the surrounding context)
                - a method connecting inherently different components typically focuses on their similarities of a particular type (similarity in difference type, similarity in attribute value like position)
                  - example:
                    - an area calculation focuses on the similarity in difference type between the reference points included (theyre similar in the difference type of 'position', or similar in aggregate group inherent to the difference type of 'aggregate shapes formed by subsets')
                    - area calculations could focus on differences from other related area shapes, differences from other shapes like intersecting lines, differences of boundaries from difference types (like cascading differences created by exponents rather than constant/stable differences like straight lines)
            - 'significant differences' between components is a useful standardizing interface for systems (significant differences from vertexes, from core components, from structures, from defaults)


  - map gravity to similarity (in position) as a calculation efficiency, where calculation efficiencies (like how to minimize surface area or how to apply a key to decrypt info) are an input to information
    - gravity between bulk/boundary creating the mapping of equivalent attributes
      - gravity as:
        - the average or highest-weighted path of interacting paths
        - structure of efficiency through organization 
    - definition: 'structure of minimized surface area as a component of 'entanglement' connecting function of two boundary points'
      - reduced mapping (minimized surface area) is a calculation efficiency to determine boundary position
        - this reduced mapping could be used to connect boundary positions (or their components like an attribute)
    - entanglement as an efficiency to handle risk of information destruction or to handle over efficiency (distribute efficiency (in the form of information) across multiple points)
      - use a mapping efficiency to connect distributed info with structural similarities
    - particles lose their adjacence/similarity bias/efficiency inside the black hole
    - "highest-weighted path from point a to b is the most efficient space-time path, which is not always equal to the 'classical physics' space-time path" (find examples of intents that classical physics is not efficient for)
      - is quantum physics using a different definition of efficiency/similarity or is it using another priority (like energy storage vs. energy usage)
      - how do weighted quantum paths interact with the weighted paths of other particles
    - nonlocality/entanglement as a calculation efficiency in the form of the replica trick
    - wormholes as:
      - calculation efficiencies
      - radiation given off of calculation efficiencies, removing information or filters preventing possibilities
      - sequence of a lack of filters preventing possible paths
      - interfaces (connecting standardizing functions)
      - hidden variables/differences (masquerading as similarities)
    - 'replica trick' as:
      - a way of transferring energy stored in sequential repetition (one coin outcome repeated a number of times in a sequence structure) to energy stored in distributed equivalence (two coins having equal outcome)
    - time as:
      - energy store
        - if time exists, it means change is possible, because energy has been organized in a structure that allows change to occur, meaning structures have developed, meaning efficient structures have been found (organization of energy formats)
        - can you attract other spacetimes so theyre adjacent by storing energy in a way that is adjacent to their storage methods
