    - valid: having reason/logic/info supporting why it would be true, without higher-validity contradiction (info, more valid logic with higher support:contradiction ratio or higher applicability)
    - games (metric optimization, input/output link finding) 
      - games applying system context (metric selection) & function (function building) as a source of interfaces
    - important decisions as changes that are limited, clear & necessary (two options to change direction rather than 360 degrees of direction change options)
      - calculating decision metadata (optimal decision given intent, optimal decision across intents, least risky/causal decisions, alternative/equivalent decisions) can reduce the solution space of likely decisions
      - rather than predicting just using user decision history/incentives, predict using system incentives present in the decision-generating limits & indicated in decision metadata
    - integration/organization structures
      - give example of structures (like alignments, positions, directions) necessary to integrate structures of organization
        - organization structures are methods of organizing information (like neural architecture, information networks, OS)
        - as organization systems become integrated (like "applying an OS to machine learning networks to intercept/replace/validate bio system functionality"), their differences in structures like position and their organization & optimization structures will cause problems that are less predictable than other problems
          - example: applying a 'separation of functionality' structure to folders like occurs on an OS to a machine learning network structure may produce errors like 'separation of function & intent', which can be sub-optimal for tasks like 'identifying optimization metrics'
            - if this is further complicated by integration into a system as complex as the bio-system (for example by using that OS/network organization structure integration to filter & allocate sensory input information), it could cause less predictable errors, like misidentifying a bio system interface

    - why not call interfaces a system? 
      - everything can be formatted as a system, not everything is an interface - an interface is like a location where different systems can meet to communicate

      - objects: a data set, function set, attribute set, class definition, type hierarchy
      - attribute value: value held by the attribute like True/False
      - attribute property: conceptual metadata property of the attribute like unique, identifier, static, etc
      - decisions:
        - choosing to execute one section of code over another; 
        - for example a conditional statement, design patterns, emergent usage/behavior 
          of user/system, bugs, assumptions, & possible input values are decisions since
          they may result in calling different code
      - relationship types: sub-type, causal factor, cooperating equal, different version
      - strategy: rule used to make decisions, possibly for a particular context
      - solution: strategy implemented for a particular context & problem type

        - meaning
          - structure:
            - relevance (to a position/intent)
              - importance
                - utility value
                - uniqueness
              - similarity
            - system fit
              - understanding

    - clarify/resolve terms that can be conflated: 
      - shape/structure
      - rule/test/metric/limit/threshold/boundary/state change/phase shift
      - intent/priority/motivation/incentive
      - method/function/rule/pattern (pattern is a sequence of specific objects)
      - path/route/trajectory/traversal/order/list/sequence
      - object/entity/item/component
      - type/class/category/group/subset
      - closed/isolated/independence/unique/orthogonal
      - model/perspective/filter
      - standard/interface/index/symmetry
      - dimension/variable/axis
      - space/system/context
      - perspective/filter/standard/index & relationship to variables/operations on the interface
      - filter vs. rule is a similar question to attribute vs. rule - sometimes one format is better based on the info you have, sometimes its worth it to transform the format
        - interface network: a set of standardizing filters applicable to format information in way that it can be analyzed with interface-specific logic, 
        - a query of the interface network may also be a problem-solving automation workflow, if problems can be solved with the format sequence indicated by the interface traversal

        - For a prediction function problem, the solution space is the range of likely prediction functions. 
        - The problem space is the route between independent variables and the dependent variable on a network - it can also be framed as the route between common prediction function terms for a data set like the input data set, and the prediction function. The original problem structure is also depicted as a subset of this problem space visualization.
        - The solution function can be a route on the problem space if the problem space is formatted as a network, for example.
        
        - interface: a useful standard for comparison consisting of the filtering object's definition routes, conversion function, core functions, objects, & attributes, and related objects like patterns & metadata specific to the interface. Abstract interfaces include cause, concept, structure, etc, whereas specific interfaces are other foundations where change develops in a clearly defined range that can be found in specific systems. The traversal of an interface implies finding a map between objects, functions, & attributes inherent to that interface to the problem objects, functions, & attributes. The application of an interface is an operation in an interface combination, mapping, injection, or other operation. 
        - function: a set of inputs, a sequential list of rules or rule lists (logic tree) applied to the input set, an output set created by changes to the input set executed by the sequential rule list, optionally including side effects from execution. A function may be formatted in a different way, such as a list of attributes, filters, or a network. The function definition includes: 
            - attributes: 
                - alignment: enforced/optional, core, required, emergent/output (built from core functions, with or without associated intent) 
                - interaction: cooperative/conflicting 
                - intent: generative, filtering, grouping, organization/delegation/ distribution/matching/grouping/filtering, classification, differentiation/ transformation 
                - scope: use case, context, range, host system 
                - related objects (like host spaces/systems & object positions in those) 
                - types: 
                    - core functions 
                    - meta (rule-modification/generation rules) 
                    - attribute rules (state, scope) 
                    - interaction rules (competition, binding, combination, sharing, collaboration, intersection, conflict resolution, trade rules) 
                    - assessment rules (metric, difference, definition, validation) 
                    - processing rules 
                    - change rules (update, distortion, maintenance, adjacency, conversion) 
                    - filtering rules (find, identify, define, alternate, organize, learn) - matching rules (fitting a structure, filling a structures) 
                    - application rules (inject, embed, apply) 
                    - derivation rules (structure, navigate, abstract) 
                    - decision rules (prioritize, select, compare) 
                    - formatting rules (standardize, isolate, cluster) 
                    - destruction rules (replace, invalidate, neutralize, remove, merge, de- duplicate) 
                    - government rules (monitor, correct, enforce, maintain, stabilize) 
                    - system rules (incentives, variance handling, optimization) 
                    - interface rules (change, intent, type, pattern, concept) 
                    - info rules (problem, strategy, insight, game, perspective) 
                    - variance (injection, leaks, combination, replacement, causal direction, uncertainty, risk, potential, probability, prediction) rules 
                    - information handling (storage, versioning, replacement, merging, monitoring, indexing, communication, interpretation, processing) 
                    - solution rules (variance/stressor/error detection, tracing, identification & handler) 
                    - structure rules (gap, boundary, system, limit, hub, object, link, network, filter)     
        - intent: any of an abstract goal with direction, a reason to use something, or an output such as the intended result or an unintended side effect, which can be an abstract priority like fairness, a concrete goal, and can have a starting & ending position. 
        - game: a set of intents/alternatives/limits/incentives/exploits/rules/risk & a definition of distance from intent fulfillment (position), usually resulting in the resolution of a clearly optimal route. The game definition includes: 
            - a game is a type of system & a mixed set, which can exist as a component of a system 
            - games can have many different structures like: 
                - a directed graph with a vector set representing possible agent intents/functions/resources 
                - a system of nodes & links where agents need function input resources to traverse 
                - a decision tree where certain tree info becomes accessible only at certain nodes (adding uncertainty/risk) 
                - a set of trade options between nodes with different info change/update rules in a system to optimize a resource/trade/market metric 
        - concept: set of unique objects remaining once objects from other spaces have their context & contradictory attributes removed. For example: power is the object left when objects implementing it: resources => energy => input => potential) have their context removed, navigating up the abstraction stack from: 
            - the info layer (resources & energy), removing their contextual attributes/rules - to the abstract structural layer (input) 
            - to the abstract layer (potential, which is a related concept of power) 
            - so that the final object is defined in terms of other abstract objects on the top layer 
        - problem: may include any context or condition that causes a negative position or state determined by a metric for an agent in a system. The problem definition includes problem types like dependencies, leaks (variance, resource/info),  injection (assumptions/variance/control/randomness), mismatches, conflicts, imbalances, inefficiencies, incorrect metric, misidentification, gaps, limits, side effects: whether it's a closed system or leaks variance (function side effect example: before execution: pre-computing, during: memory access/overflow, after: process re-starting), specific problems like an enforcement gap (should have enforced rule but did not), an unintended use (involves integrated third party tech not under review), a malicious alternative route to get same output, a legitimate/alternative route to get malicious output. 
        - problem space: context relevant to a problem; the containing system(s) of a problem that may include related problems 
        - solution: may include any combination of events, methods, or steps that reduces the negative position or state for the specified agent. The solution definition includes solution types: 
            - solution-metadata solution: evaluating & comparing solution metadata for solution selection 
            - problem-metadata solution: evaluating problem metadata to evaluate metrics like problem-solving postponement 
            - generative solution: solution that generates solutions 
            - solution framework: provides starting point & structures for solutions to be built in/with 
            - problem decomposer: solution that reduces a problem's root causative (as opposed to just varying) parameters 
            - solution automator: solution that automates solutions of a type 
            - interim solution: clearly suboptimal solution while optimal alternative is built 
            - solution query constructor: solution that builds new solutions out of known solution types (existing structural solutions or core functions) 
            - structure-finding solution: solution that assigns a structure to information 
            - structure-fitting solution: solution that matches the gaps/limits in a problem structure to neutralize them 
        - solution space: set of possible solutions in a problem space, which may be reduced by applying interface traversals like solution space-reducing insight paths 
        - network: standard network graph containing nodes (sometimes called vertices) & linking functions (sometimes called edges), with or without node attributes, function relationship determining function shape, and direction as an indicator of intent or another metric. 

        - component: functions/attributes/types/objects/systems 
        - input information: can refer to original information input to the initial interface traversal, or traversal output information that has been converted, enhanced, formatted, or otherwise altered in a prior interface traversal, stored as a possible version of the original input information, and sent as input to another interface traversal 
        - interface: 
          - function: a set of inputs, a sequential list of rules or rule lists (logic tree) applied to the input set, an output set created by changes to the input set executed by the sequential rule list, optionally including side effects from execution. A function may be formatted in a different way, such as a list of attributes, filters, or a network. 
          - intent: any of an abstract goal with direction, a reason to use something, or an output such as the intended result or an unintended side effect, which can be an abstract priority like fairness, a concrete goal, and can have a starting & ending position. 
          - concept: set of unique objects remaining once objects from other spaces have their context & contradictory attributes removed.  
        - network: standard network graph containing nodes (sometimes called vertices) & linking functions (sometimes called edges), with or without node attributes, function relationship determining function shape, and direction as an indicator of intent or another metric.  

       - info conceptual relationships:
          priority = direction
          observation = insight = function = result = relationship
          conclusion = ordered_list(observations) + guess = coefficients + bias
          strategy = ordered_list(insights)
          strategy = insight + context
          problem = (combination of intents having different priorities) or (an resource distribution imbalance)
          intent = strategy + priority
          solution = (combination of strategies operating on variables with insight functions that reduce dimensions of problem (function-combination) or (resource-imbalance))
          type = combination(attributes)
          intents = function outputs, including unintended/emergent/unforeseen side effects (target/avoid)
          roles = functions
          relationships = treatments, intents, functions, insights, strategies, mechanisms, patterns, systems
          components = compounds, symptoms, treatments, metrics, conditions, stressors, types, variables
