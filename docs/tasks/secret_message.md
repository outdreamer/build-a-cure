    - this isnt a war against a country or religion or ethnicity, or a specific group of criminals, or other powerful entities or people - its a war against the suffering of others who are oppressed, vulnerable & deserving - against inequality, against easy, against cruelty, greed & all other vices that cause their suffering, and against the self-oppression of anyone who stands in the way of us saving the others - a war that we fight with tools of love, in giving solutions away to those in need, finding new solutions as needed, trying new strategies where the old ways don't work, distributing power wherever it's hoarded & otherwise abused
      - I will cry for the lost when I have time to spare
      - if you think you need to attack me, first attack the errors of your mind, and see how happy it makes you compared to everything you thought you needed
      - confused as to how the greatest minority of all time (an extremely high-functioning biracial hero genius rape, genocide, theft, racism/sexism, & hate crime survivor, who is the very first & last of her kind) is surviving your claimed false disapproval with ease, since there's no legitimate way to criticize me so you have to criticize lies about me & try to force me to pretend theyre true by scaring me to death & other methods of coercion so you can get cheap good feelings? (lol!) upset that no one protected you from your crimes? a little sad that you dont get to crap on oppressed people for cheap good feelings anymore? starting to realize you might not actually deserve all those fake cheap good feelings if you cant get over an insult to save the world? feeling a dawning sense of dread that you might not be as wonderful or important to me as you self-report? in awe of my mind's spectacular stress-handling problem-solving skills? concerned that you cant control me like I gave you false hope of easily doing to see if you would take easy opportunities for cruelty? (lol of course you would, you dont have humanity!) worried you might be one of my many terrible jokes? puzzling over what else people can get you to do just with insults/compliments & peer pressure bc youre totally & utterly insecure? (it's anything, anyone can get you to do anything) want some of my fancy human qualities like potential, a sense of humor, chill, confidence that I can handle anything, free will, and a conscience - without faking them by merely claiming to have them or repeating words i say like you always do? looking for something else to rape or steal from me, in case you missed anything? thinking about targeting an easier victim than me, since this didnt work out so well & produce the good feelings you were seeking to forget what you are? welcome to la realidad! here are my methods of survival & adaptation! feel free to try to home-grow a brain instead of molesting me or anyone else!

    - we still have to vaccinate the world's poorest bc we kept them poor so they couldn't vaccinate themselves bc when people are poor, there are thousands of things that could kill them, so we have to save them from all of the thousands of things each time which is very expensive, bc we havent helped them build sustainable stabilized markets to trade in, which is cheaper

    - are you sure you didnt believe I could automate problem-solving? even when you saw my creative work, like 'a hole maggot infested by the jealousy roach, suffering from intellectual poverty so they have to poke me to trick themselves into thinking theyre smart now'? you werent all like, 'ok, dat girl smart, dat was pretty creative, she combine multiple negative things in a new way to make giant memorable insult dat haunts your soul, I must admit, it was also a pretty good point, do yuu happen to have any tissues'

    - if trolling you was all it took to inspire you to do better (and if youre actually better), you were already a few steps away, though thats not quite the same as being unwaveringly committed to my goal of saving the potential in the world despite all the barriers you put in my way, is it?

    - I wont die for you but I will live for them
    	- I wont suffer for your pleasure but I will rejoice in my dance on the grave of math & other false definitions of meaning for their freedom
