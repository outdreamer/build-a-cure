  - give example of insight path to generate a solution insight path for a problem on demand

    - apply solution structures like:
      - balance between supply/demand
      - maximizing benefit/cost ratio

      to problem structures (metadata like available/missing info) to produce solution (insight path) variables:
      - cost of ignoring/focusing on info vs. benefit of actions like executing functions
      - cost of acquiring more info vs. benefits of applying quick best-case solutions
      - supply of available info vs. demand for info to solve the problem

    - then select/change variable structures (variable values & variable sets) to produce components of solutions (insight paths) for a problem:
        - concept components: low-impact variables, high-variation variables, most causative problems, worst/best case context
        - function components: filter (ignore/focus/assume), prioritize (set as primary intent), apply structure (like subset)
        
    - then apply structures to combine insight path components for a problem:
      - 'ignore low-impact variables to prioritize high-impact variables'

    - then filter by problem structure (intents, sub-intents) to re-integrate insight paths with problem:

      - apply filters like:
        - 'is a direct cause of the problem ignoring local/contextual/worst-case/probability info?'
        - 'does a function applied to a component tend to cause problems in complex systems, and is this a complex system'

      to produce reduction of possible solution insight paths like:
        - 'then ignore insight paths using those structures'
        - 'then apply further filters to check for a reason (possible benefit) to ignore that'

    - functional insight path (what to execute) :: filter insight path (what to rule out or focus on)
      - 'breaking down problems into sub-problems' :: ignore non-isolatable problem types & non-combinable solution types
      - 'identify worst case scenarios first and solving those in order' :: ignore less harmful problems (local/output problems) to prioritize more harmful problems (causal problems, problem types)
      - 'identify vertex variables & standardize to them, using solutions that act exclusively on them' :: ignore less impactful variables to address root causes
      - 'identify position of problem in causal network and apply solutions local to that context' :: ignore systemic solutions to avoid side effects
      - 'find alternatives to solving a problem (delegation, solving abstract version)' :: ignore specific solutions or move problem position
      - 'identify problem type & apply related known solutions' :: assume problem type can be identified & covers enough of the problem & is abstract enough to apply related solutions with effective impact
