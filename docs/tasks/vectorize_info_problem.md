  - algorithm to mathematize (apply math structures to) an info problem

    - apply point structure: find examples
    - apply set structure: find combinations
    - apply boundary structure: find limits (systems, shapes, expectations)
    - apply gap structure: find possibilities (opportunities)
    - apply sequence structure: find paths
      - apply input structure: find assumptions (requirements)
      - apply output structure: find intent (side effects)
      - apply function structure: find connections (cause)
    - apply origin structure: find symmetries (equivalence)
    - apply vector structure: find differences (comparisons, opposites, errors, distortions/imbalances)

      - identify vertexes & transform input info to vectors for each vertex
      - identify interfaces & primary interface objects & transform input to vectors for each vertex
      - apply queries across vector spaces to find patterns of change that produce solutions optimally (quickest or most accurately)

      - integrated info format for formatting vectors across vector spaces representing differences within an interface/vertex variable
        space1.vectorA (magnitudeA, directionA) = space1.basis vector coefficient combination
        spaces.space1.vectorA = spacevector.vectorA = vector differenting from other spaces
        [space coefficient combination].[vector coefficient combination]
        [space topology position].[vector topology position]

        - in this format, you store info about the original vector with its relative position to other vectors given the basis vectors of that space, and info about the original space with its relative position to other spaces

        - each space offers a relative position for differences in an interface

        - given the set of vectors mapped within each space, the vertex vectors of the original differentiating vectors can be mapped as the vector space instead

        - alternative vector formats/variables
          - vector paths: store method to generate a particular vector
          - vector boundaries: store info about vectors with similar interaction layers (like 'interacting with a sphere of radius 1')
          - vector gaps: store info about a space lacking vectors in a vector space
          - vector bases (core sets): store info about alternate basis vector sets describing a vector space according to different bases of change units
          - vector shapes: shapes formed by vectors (points, polygons, shapes, corners, angles, centers, intersections)
          
        - the vectors may be more efficiently described in one format than another, within or across spaces
        - to integrate the vector spaces that have had these formats applied, you can:
          - maintain the original space and describe the vector variables with the new vertex vector sets
          - create new vector spaces to map the differences in that variable
        - if the differences dont hold across every vector space, you can:
          - calculate the contribution of that space in another space where it would contribute to those difference types
          - find a space where both the non-contributing vector space and the contributing vector space can be differentiated & calculate it there

    - example of structural math info formats according to intent
      - add to shape definition routes with matching intents supported by each
        - adjacent intents use the objects directly stated in the definition route:
          - endpoint alignment
            - adjacent intents associated with this format:
              - use endpoints & rotation/shifting transforms to build a shape
              - complete a shape using a line and an 'align endpoint' function
              - store just endpoint & alignment info
              - use an angle determining function to provide input to an alignment function
              - keep coordinate info intact after transform
              - track changes within space using endpoint/line coordinate changes
              - use core structure (line, angle) as a building block
          - coordinates of one corner & side length
          - side count & angle

    - example of a vertex of a structure, like vertex vectors
      - the integrating structure organizing these structure formats (alternate, identifying) of a structure (vector) forms a complete description of a vertex, which can be indexed on a vertex vector space
