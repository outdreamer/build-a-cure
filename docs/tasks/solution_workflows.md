## other solution automation workflows

    - apply structures of interface components to solution automation workflows to generate solution automation workflows
      - apply 'pattern' structures (like 'common' structures) to solution automation workflows to generate solution automation workflows
        - generate structures common across multiple solution automation workflows
          - structures to identify solutions
            - any structures that qualify as the following can help fulfill the problem-solving intent of 'identify solutions', so they can be used as a solution automation workflow (once the solution space is identified or if the solution space is a given input)
              - solution metric filters
              - error structures
              - optimization structures

    - apply interfaces & interface components useful to solve various interface query sub-problems (like 'determining probable cost/benefit of a sub-query before executing it') to design optimal interface queries to apply core interaction functions (like 'connect') to problems/solutions
        - example:
          - apply the abstract interface to identify interaction structures between definitions as a filter to determine whether a possible structure (like a query or a solution automation workflow or a function) is worth executing/implementing before executing/implementing it for a given intent (whether it will fulfill the intended function, to generate the intended output)
            - example: 
              - before appling the concept of power to generate an output, check if definition interaction structures indicate the actual output will be the intended output
                - if applying power structures to generate power is the intent, its a valid structure given the definition of power (& its interactions given definitions of related components like generative functions, generate, output, etc)
                - if applying power structures to generate power-neutralizing structures (like power-centralization) is the intent, its not a valid structure (given the definitions of power, centralization, neutralization, etc)

    - identify & apply changes to general solution automation workflows to fit them to & implement them as configurations of alternate problem-solving tools or tools acting as components of a solution automation workflow (ai networks/algorithms, math functions, other structures for specific intents like 'info-finding' tools as 'filter sequence' structures)
        - example: 
          - identify & apply changes to a solution automation workflow to convert it to an ai algorithm
            - identify & organize structures by one or more of the following methods:
              - identify interactive structures of the solution automation workflow
                - organize interactive structures to match original input/output mapping
              - identify component structures like functions (workflow components like implementation variables, interaction layers, definitions, input/output sequences, sub-problems, core interaction functions)
                - organize the structures into a network structure so the structures can interact in a way that maps original inputs/outputs
                - example of fitting a solution automation workflow component to an ai network/algorithm structure:
                  - identify variables of the workflow implementation
                    - apply variables of the workflow implementation as 'network parameter' structures or apply them to generate 'alternative network/algorithm' structures
                  - identify solution metrics of the workflow
                    - apply solution metrics as final layers or filters (like threshold values or other boundary/limiting/condition structures like input/output connection restrictions) in the algorithm
                  - identify core interaction function of the workflow & apply as a general intent of input/output structure mapping of the network 
                    - example: the 'reduce' interaction function of the workflow should 'reduce' the relevant network problem inputs (variables) to the 'important variable' structures, or reduce it to a 'category prediction' structure

    - identify & apply changes to problem structure to more optimally fulfill multiple/alternate adjacent core interaction functions (like connect/reduce) or associated solution automation workflows, as a general static method of solving a problem, thereby executing one or more core problem-solution interaction functions in a structure like a sequence/network as a general solution automation workflow

        - apply 'reduce' to the problem: 
          - reduce the differences between problem/solution by converting the input into a more adjacent format to the solution (containing variables already known to be important in the data set)
            - apply changes to input data to make it a possible input to tool structures (like algorithm sequences or network of quantum bits) for a specific structure (like a useful function sequence or a network of related sub-problems/questions or sub-systems)
              - example: 
                - apply changes to make input data a possible input to the useful function sequence: 
                  - feature selection algorithm 
                  - normal ai algorithm to create a prediction function
                - structure quantum bits in a structure that connects them according to an interface query, resolving sub-systems/problems in separate bit structures and integrating them in a structure reflective of reality (or reflections of it captured in useful/realistic system structures like efficiencies or in patterns reflecting realistic probabilities), implementing the 'break problems into sub-problems & aggregate/integrate into solutions' workflow

        - apply 'connect' to the problem/solution:
          - connect the problem/solution by connecting important structures in the data set to the input to the algorithm to identify important variables (using highlighting structures like markers/masks for image data)
          - apply changes to input data to make it possible to input into existing tools/functions that connect the problem/solution
            - example: when applying AI, first distort useful system/interface components like structural similarities/alignments/efficiencies in data sets to reduce the work of Ai algorithms to identify important variables/structures, or automate this by applying important variable or variable structure patterns like hub variables connecting many variables with functions like 'cause' or foundation variables (on which other variables develop) to identify these structures automatically
              - this connects the problem format of a data set with the solution format of a prediction function, using additional logic to transform the data set into another data set format that is a possible input to an AI algorithm, but with additional highlighting distortions added in the data set format to keep it in a format that is useful to an AI algorithm with the relevant modifications to make the ai algorithm's task more adjacent

    - apply interfaces (like concept/cause/function) to generate solution automation workflows that connect problem/solution metadata given known connections between problems-solutions
        - apply core interaction function (like 'connect') to problem/solution metadata (like 'generative functions' or vertex variables) of problem/solutions structures instead of the structures themselves
          - example:
            - generative function of a 'info asymmetry problem' is 'apply filters to outbound info to aggregate info on one side of the filter'
            - generative function of a 'info asymmetry solution' is 'apply opposite function of any problem-generating functions (aggregation) & opposite structure of any problem-generating structures found (filter)'
        - generated solution automation workflow using problem/solution-generating function metadata:
          - 'apply opposite function of any problem-generating functions (aggregation) & opposite structure of any problem-generating structures found (filter)'
        - this could also be generated by applying the conceptual interface to the solution
          - abstract problem-generating function: 
            - 'apply structures (outbound filter) that would fulfill a problem-generating function (aggregation) on a structure (info) given a solution metric (aggregation on one side of filter, indicating no outputs of problem-generating function contradict aggregation)'
          - abstract solution-generating function: 
            - 'apply opposite function of problem-generating structures (outbound filter) that are inputs to problem-generating functions (aggregation) & apply opposite function of problem-generating function outputs (aggregation on one side of filter)'
          - abstract connection function of problem/solution-generating functions:
            - 'apply a connection function that connects opposite structures like problems/solutions (an opposite functions) to the problem-generating function to generate the solution-generating function'

    - convert structures to a structure type that maps to structures with more clearly defined connections/components to convert the problem into a more determinable problem, if the new structures dont lose relevant info
        - example: 
          - randomness is 'equal probability of outcomes' which can be converted to a structure of difference types like 'equal probability of difference structures from a number'
          - once structures of the problem space are mapped to these core structure types that are easily mapped to the math interface (like difference to 'distance between positions' or 'angle between lines with same origin' or 'vector magnitude/angle'), the problem can be converted into math terms

        - example problem: 'find minima/maxima of function'
          - applying randomness structures is one way to solve the problem - testing random points for limits to narrow down the function minima/maxima possibilities
          - difference structures can also be applied as an approximation of randomness
            - difference structure examples:
              - difference of same type (like an 'opposite' difference type) in all function variables
              - difference of different types in all function variables
              - difference based on similarity structures (like general function/variable patterns, or actual function change rates), like creating a difference to check if a pattern applies to the function
        - example:
          - logic can be defined as 'connectivity of rules', which can be standardized to the structure or math interface to more clearly determine logic interactions/components
            - structure interface:
              - graph logic connectivity rules as a function network
                - example: logic connectivity rules themselves obey logic connectivity rules, so they can be connected with those rules (like 'connect rules by equivalence of rule components')
            - math interface:
              - graph logic connectivity rules as a set of math structures (like points/vectors/functions)
                - example: a connected logic rule network can be formatted as standard math structures like:
                  - a set of functions (indicating steps), where one rule is x steps away from another, indicating the number of rules required to connect them
                    - where n number of steps can also indicate distance between points
                    - where functions can be components of the network, and to get from one component path (input object to logic rule, or logic rule) to another (input object or logic rule), a specific network path between logic rule function nodes must be traversed (logic rules connecting them)
                    - where the network nodes are (either components, functions, or both), where components are connected by a set of functions indicating operations between components found in logic rules
                    - where relevant structures like equivalences between logic rules are applied to the network structure
                      - so alternate components are removed & an original component takes the position of its equivalents
                      - where logic rule contradictions act like limits (like filters or barriers) to operations & traversals on the network structure
                      - where defined structures are prioritized in traversals to limit the impact of implicit structures like implications & patterns & similarities, which arent definitively relevant/true & may be false
            - once its formatted in more determined/defined structures, determining the following become trivial:
              - whether a rule is new to the logic network
              - whether a rule fits with the logic network
              - whether an object can be tested for a connection to another object using the rules of the converted logic network, or whether less definitive structures are needed to infer logic connections

### apply solution success cause structures as a solution or solution component filter

    - apply structures relevant to 'generative' function intents to the intent of 'generating solution automation workflows'
        - structures relevant to 'generative' intents:
          - variable structures
          - alternate structures
          - structures of difference

    - find generative structures of useful structures (like solution success cause structures) & apply to find/derive/generate solution structures likely to be successful
          - solution success cause structures like:
            - 'this solution fulfilled more general optimization or specific solution metrics'
            - 'this solution addressed the root cause, preventing the problem from occurring'
            - 'this solution was general and prevented other variants of the problem'
          - generative structures of solution success causes:
            - solution success causes are caused by interface components relevant to optimization like:
              - alignment/similarity (multiple solution metrics fulfilled, higher ratio of metrics fulfilled relative to other solutions)
              - fix cause rather than output
              - abstract rather than specific solution
              - prevention rather than fixing

    - iterate through solution success causes & apply interface structures to them to identify/generate/derive an associated solution automation workflow with that solution success cause
        - example solution success causes:
          - 'structural similarities are an opposite structure of a problem of difference so theyre useful for resolving difference problems'
            - apply abstract interface to (identify the general types in) the above solution success cause to identify the general pattern:
              - 'structures of type x are a difference structure of a difference problem, a difference to a problem being a solution, so structures of type x are useful for solving difference problems'
                - apply function interface to identify functionality structures ('x has functionality of connecting y & z')
                  - 'differences are a structure that can connect a problem to a solution bc they are different by definition'
            - generated solution automation workflow: 
              - identify structures that connect problems/solutions as a way of finding a solution to a problem
          - 'problem-solving can be formatted as a problem of defining the problem & solution'
            - apply change interface
              - once problem & solution have been changed by applying the 'definition' function, they are easier to 'connect' (a core problem-solving function)
                - apply 'alternative' change function
                  - what other core problem-solving functions are there (reduce, remove, neutralize, use to solve another problem, fill, structurize/define, find, build)
                  - iterate through these functions
                    - what else makes problems/solutions easier to fulfill core problem-solving functions
                      - what makes building a solution easier to fulfill (core components of solution)
                      - what makes structurizing a problem/solution easier to fulfill (library of core structures & structures adjacent to that structure & connecting structures)
                      - what makes finding a solution easier to fulfill (a reduced solution space using solution metric structures as limits)
                - generated solution automation workflow:
                  - general workflow:
                    - iterate through core problem-solving functions (define, connect, reduce) & structures useful for those functions (structures, connections/differences, efficiencies/minimizing functions) & apply them to fulfill problem-solving function like 'connect' (or related problem-solving function) for problem/solution
                    - specific workflow:
                      - apply 'structures' (structure useful for 'define/structurize' problem-solving function) to 'connect' (core problem-solvingn function) problem/solution 'definitions' (structure relevant to 'define/structurize' problem-solving function)
                      - identify 'connection structures' (useful structures) between 'opposite structures' (problem structures) for a 'difference' problem (resolvable with 'connection structures')
      - solution success cause of the above solution: automating problem-solving can be formatted as a problem of defining (applying structure to) the problem & solution
        - apply structures to problem & solution definitions until one optimizes for reducing solution space, or until theyre equivalent
        - identify connections between definitions of problem-solution connection structures (like connections between opposite/difference structures) and apply to connect problem/solution definitions

      - example of applying solution success causes to generate solution automation workflows
        - solution success cause: why are certain structures of structures more useful
          - bc they reduce differences between origin & target
          - a 'function that identifies causative ability of a change type (variable)' is by definition useful to solving a problem of 'find causes of dependent variable' bc it connects the component 'cause' of the problem with interim structures that are 'less different' from the solution (like the original input independent variables or structures like combinations of them), which interact with other problem/solution components like the solution target, the 'dependent variable', in a way that reduces the difference to the solution
            - generated solution automation workflow:
              - apply structures that fulfill the intent 'reduce difference' between problem/solution components relevant to that intent (problem/solution structures that 'shouldnt be different', or 'should be connected'), components like problem cause & adjacent solution causes (combinations of input variables)
          - some structures are more useful in general (rather than for a specific intent) bc the intents they are useful to are themselves more general or more common
          - 'finding structures of alignment' is useful in general bc structures of alignment solve problems of difference/conflict, which are common problem structures
          - useful problem-solving structures can be found by which structures of structures solve common problem structures

    - apply solution success cause structures to find/derive/generate solutions that are likely to be successful
      - filter solutions once existing solution data (for other problems) is indexed by solution success/error cause ('reason why it worked or didnt work', such as concepts like power or certainty or interactivity)
      - example: 'apply the definition of power to generate/find power structures to find inputs that can enable this output'
        - if the 'reason why the solution worked' (or its associated 'reason why the problem exists') is present in the original problem system, that may help filter solutions more efficiently than other methods like:
          - 'try existing solutions'
            - reason why it may work: 
              - the problem space may not have changed sufficiently or the problem may not be new to invalidate existing solutions
          - 'try adjacent modifications to existing solutions'
            - reasons why it may work: 
              - existing solutions may be similar enough to a working solution that minor modifications (like by adjacent conversions built from core functions) may be sufficient
              - the problem space may not have changed sufficiently or the problem may not be new to invalidate every component of existing solutions
          - 'derive solution requirements from problem statement & filter solutions'
            - reasons why it may work:
              - the problem has enough info to derive sufficient filtering requirements
        - a reason to use a particular solution often relies on structural system components (like similarities/alignments, such as structural similarities or input/output alignments) & other important interface components
          - there is a structural similarity between the above solution & problem, indicating a reason to use it:
            - existing (non-changed) solutions fit with an existing (non-changed) problem space or problem
            - the usage intent may be to reduce cost of solving the problem
          - the more important interface components that exist connecting a solution & problem, it may be likelier that the solution is optimal for that problem
          - a reason to use the solution indicates its optimal in some way for that problem, as in it solves the problem efficiently according to some metric
          - examples
            - opposite structure:
              - an opposite structure connecting a problem & solution may indicate a reason to use a solution, if the problem-solving intent is to negate, reduce, invalidate or destroy the problem, which are structures that relate to 'opposite' structures
                - a problematic structure can be solved with an opposite ('structure-destroy') solution function
              - the usage intent (reason a solution is used, like a solution metric it fulfills, such as 'minimizes cost') is different from the reason why a solution worked (why it was better than other solutions for the solution metrics, such as:
                - 'structural similarity between problem/solution where problem-solving intent was alignment'
                - 'opposite structure between problem/solution where problem-solving intent was neutralization'
        - example:
          - structural reasons why a solution worked
            - info reason
              - bc the solution was the fitting structure to the problem structure
            - system reason
              - bc structural similarities are a useful structure for solving 'fitting' interaction problems
            - direct reason
              - bc the inputs to the solution already existed in the system
            - cause reason
              - bc the solution addressed a root cause of the problem
            - abstract reason
              - bc the solution solves the problem type of the problem

        - components of 'reasons why solutions work for a problem' can be inputs to interface operations (to combine/filter reasons, or build interface queries or solution automation workflows) to:
            - find the reason why a particular reason is relevant to a problem/solution
            - design a reason why a solution should work & then test it
            - derive a reason why a solution worked
            - filter solution automation workflow insight paths
    
### apply useful solution filters

    - apply optimal structure finding/selecting rules to select structures that fulfill solution filters such as:
        - preserve relevant info
          - input/output variables should have their position preserved bc there are few cases where input/output flag is not relevant
        - isolate differences & combine similarities as needed
          - variable groups should be differentiated from individual variables bc variable groups are on a different interaction level
          - input/output variables should be connected in some way (like constant position or adjacence or connecting path) but should also be clearly isolated, unless interchangeable
        - choose a base that fits & is relevant to data meaning
          - connecting variables based on original position adjacence if no position changes are necessary
          - connecting states in original sequence based on time
        - avoid assigning arbitrary structures
          - distance/position that doesnt indicate info about a function, attribute, or identity

    - apply solution metric filters derived from applying interfaces

      - determine whether something 'makes sense' using the logic interface:
        - insight: 'deploying a change makes sense if the change increases meaningful benefits or decreases meaningful costs'
        - problem question: 'does reducing inequality reduce or increase costs in general'
          - identify the costs/benefits of reducing inequality 
            - reduces costs:
              - deploying specific solutions as needed after determining where theyre needed (vaccines, military/police funding, & food aid (solve specific problems for other people))
              - debt default costs of unpaid debts
              - insurance/safety net payout costs
            - increases costs (deployment/implementation costs)
              - cost of convincing market participants to implement this strategy & deploying implementation
              - increases/re-allocates costs to temporary one-time costs:
                - reducing pollution
                - educating workers so they can automate their jobs (create efficiencies to reduce global work requirements)
                - increasing wages for lowest paid workers
                - automation of labor to produce/deliver required basic goods to make it relatively cheap to do so
            - reduces benefits:
              - reduces suppliers in the cheapest labor market
            - increases benefits:
              - new suppliers (labor/products/employment, loaners)
              - new demanders (consumers, borrowers)
              - increases cash flow, investment, & trading
              - new self-suppliers of self-demanders (solve their own specific problems, with already available information about what they need)

        - apply 'contradiction' (opposite) filter: should any of these changes from inequality-reduction be avoided for any reason, that are more relevant/important than the reasons to reduce inequality
          - if none found, costs/benefits of the strategy to implement the goal are accurately meaningful, meaning (with relevance to original question) that:
            - 'reducing inequality does reduce costs in general'
            - meaning of this query on the logic interface:
              - it was possible to connect 'reduce inequality' to 'reduce costs in general' using logical connections of the interaction rules of those components (cost, general, inequality, reduce)
                - logical connections use definitions & interaction rules to link components
                  - two rules can be directly connected in a sequence without conversion if the output of one rule matches the input to the other
                  - two rules can be directly connected without conversion if common components in both rules are equivalent

    - apply useful filtering structures for identifying solution automation workflow components like solutions/errors

        - apply probability structures as a filter when generating possible error/solution structures
          - find determining attributes of more probable structures like:
            - structures with more common components
            - structures with more relevant/useful intents for more agents
            - structures with higher coordination, alignment, & interactivity
            - structures that are more stable
          - this can be used as a filter when selecting structures like solutions

        - energy interaction rules can be used to predict/derive info interaction rules
          - this is bc info stores energy (usually as approximations), and info interacts with other info according to energy interactions like potential, variability, interactivity, etc
            - example: change cascades (functions with non-constantly changing values) can predict structures governed by momentum (like a bouncing ball), given how momentum changes a value non-constantly
            - other energy interactions can predict info structures useful for describing/deriving connections given structural similarities like relevant equivalences/patterns/types/opposites that the energy & info interactions have in common, like change/difference type such as 'sequential continuous position change' and 'change cascade'
            - how info interacts with its opposite structures like limits & contradictions also mimics energy interactions, so info can be predicted by its limits
            - more interactivity with other info produces more errors, depending on the variation of the interactions
              - more errors may result in a randomized probability distribution of its outputs
                - the state of an energy unit's info symmetry/field with respect to its position in this randomization process is another input to its structure

    - derive insight paths for implementing a solution automation workflow
        
        - apply possible different structures relevant to functions like 'connect' in solution automation workflow to implement the workflow (implement 'connect problem & solution')
          - logic governs how components can be rigorously & rationally connected (with reasons like 'equivalence indicates a connecting relation, by definition')
            - logic structures can be applied to connect problem/solution components 
          - cause governs how component interactions develop
            - cause structures can be applied to connect problem/solution components
        
        - example insight path for implementation workflow of the solution automation workflow 'connect problem & solution using format structure like a format sequence'
          - apply insight: 'connect components logically by equivalences' to 'connect problem & solution' problem:
            - connect components using definition routes of 'match' or 'fit'
              - match definition routes
                - equivalence (equal components, like matching input/outputs in a function sequence)
                - structural coordination (interacting components)
            - this is the abstract version of 'connect components using equal input/outputs'
            - the reason this works is bc relevance is meaningful, and equivalence is a structure of relevance (rules involving the same component are relevant to each other by default)
            - this is a specific implementation of the insight 'standardize components to connect them (reduce conversion work, or reduce difference)'

    - apply interface query-selection & query-design workflows to problem of 'generating/finding/deriving solution automation workflows'
        
        - for the 'find a prediction function' problem, which of the following solutions do you select:
          - start by averaging subsets of points or generating functions connecting point subsets and weighting them
          - identify core functions or base functions of prediction functions & apply changes according to function distortion patterns
          - assume that the function should be broken into subsets and that not all the variables are interactive
          - find difference of points from an average, given conceptual definition of the average as a useful prediction tool by definition of probability
          - find other conceptual definitions that apply to the prediction problem & apply them instead of the average
        
        - these solutions vary on metrics like inputs/outputs, side effects, speed, robustness, accuracy, and meaning, which vary on usefulness, so apply solution metric prioritization functions to select a solution
          - usually solutions with a basis on meaning perform better bc theyre powered by understanding, so select these where possible
          - if not possible, select solutions that fulfill more higher-priority metrics
          - if there are no solutions fulfilling more higher-priority metrics, assign a different prioritization scheme and apply that filter
          - otherwise apply other standard system optimization functions, like 'avoid side effects'
          - derive & apply solution metric filters from problem statement, problem space & problem system, & solution usage intent stack

    - generate insights to identify errors & other useful solution workflow components

        - generate structures of components related to solutions/errors
        - filter component structures to find meaningful structures (like insights or solution automation workflows or relevant errors to a system) by applying interface components:
          - insight: 'calculate absolute cost rather than specific cost'
            - applies the definition of meaning ('integrated components', like 'cost for system or agents relative to each other' as opposed to 'cost for agent') or interface ('component definition, integrating view of component from every primary perspective')
          - insight: 'error is the opposite of a solution in a problem system or problem space'
            - applies the definition of solution/error
          - insight: 'check if an error is a solution in another problem system or problem space'
            - applies structural interface components like opposite
              - check if an error can be its opposite component (and check if that context is possible/probable/adjacent/imminent, to evaluate relevance to current problem space/system)
          - insight: 'check if an error is definitely an error'
            - applies the system interface component definition of 'ambiguity'
          - insight: 'check if an error is intended or is bc of a usage intent error'
            - applies the intent interface
          - logic: 'connect components by equivalences'

    - solution automation workflow to find new problem/solution components (like error types & solution automation workflows) in a given problem system

        - map differences to distances in various dimension sets & try every combination of difference reduction
          - differences including legitimate variables, differences between correct/incorrect values of components like intended outputs & required inputs, differences between formats
          - the differences that successfully produce a solution:
            - when reduced are probably errors
            - when added are probably solution automation workflows

        - identify how problems develop to identify components to understand/solve (prevent, reduce, contain, oppose, use) them
          - how does a prediction function problem develop? 
            - when there are many variables interacting & many variable interaction types & random injection points (a problem of complexity)
            - identify & solve the cause of this complexity problem:
              - applying structures like cause to variable interactions & their change types can solve prediction function problems

    - apply problem-solution interaction structures to solution automation workflows

        - example: 
          - 'opposite', 'neutralization', 'completion/interlocking', or 'contradiction' structures are useful for optimizing interactions between problem/solution pairs, where the problem is the difference between them that should be reduced, or the lack of connection between them, or the existence of the problem that needs to be opposed, since 'neutralization' structures are by default coordinating/interactive/completing structures, so a check for problem/solution fit can be skipped
          - 'alternative' structures are useful for problems like 'lack of optimal solutions'

        - identify problem interaction functions
          - primary problem-interaction functions include the following, depending on adjacent problem structures (problem existence, a lack, a lack of time, an incorrect position, a lack of usefulness, a structure to fill, problem difference from solution)
            - identify, prevent, reduce, contain, remove, oppose, use, convert, fill, understand, approximate
          - these can be used as primary interface query intents
            - 'find cause to find preventative solution structures'
            - 'find alternative intents of the problem to find usage solution structures'
          - problem interaction functions are variables of the solution automation workflow
            - problem interface functions can be changed to use a different workflow
          - these problem interaction functions are connecting functions between the primary problem-solving intent which is a general intent of 'solve the problem', primary core functions like 'apply, build, change, derive', problem-solution interaction structures like 'neutralize problem by finding interactive contradicting structure' and solution structures like 'a prediction function' or 'a set of steps to produce a solution for this problem type'

    - apply changes to usage/application variables of an interface to generate & optimize solution automation workflows & interface queries implementing them
      - different versions of an interface can be used in place of the entire interface, just like different formats of an interface can be applied instead of the whole interface
      - interface components can be used to generate different applications of an interface
      - speed-optimizing interface applications:
        - core interface application:
          - include core components that can be used to construct other components on the interface
          - also optimizes for 'build' and 'change' intents
        - basic interface application:
          - include standard components of the interface (common components, components on the most-used interaction layer, etc)

    - apply changes to structure variables of an interface to apply the interface in different formats for different intents, like:
      - a filter for cross-interface intents that fit with a filter structure, like mapping inputs/outputs
      - a function network for performing interface operations, like converting/standardizing objects
      - a composition of other interfaces when those interfaces are more adjacent to inputs
      - a convolution when deriving what intents are supported by the interface
      - a subset of paths on a language map when handling agent-formatted queries
      - a map when used as a connecting interface to other interfaces
      - a variable network when describing the interface
      - a query on other interfaces when solving a problem in another interface

    - apply components/structures from a higher-certainty interface (like math terms) to problem components as default connecting structures
      - cycle: error type of a structure, involving a unique variable subset that can be used to derive the original structure when combined with other unique variable subsets
      - knot: structure with a gap error type where the structure's subset forming the gap allows other subsets of the structure to fill the gap
      - manifold: structure that preserves its error types when a specific set of change types are applied
      - topology: structure connecting subsets & a set, with core components of structural changes having no gap error types (continuous), having:
        - including limits in the form of including subset combinations & subset intersections determining included structures
        - excluding limit error type structure: 'combined/intersecting elements being excluded', or the opposite structure of the limit error type 'non-combined (isolated), non-intersecting (non-common) elements being included'
      - solving a problem by applying filters to the solution space converts the problem into a sorting/set problem structure, applying organization to the definition of the problem & solution so they can be accurately related
      
    - apply useful proxy/alternate concepts/structures like intents such as 'improve a problem metric' instead of intents like 'solving a problem'
      - where the problem is that a spectrum metric like accuracy/robustness is not equal to or beyond a correct value, a solution can take the form of improvement
      - 'a component that improves a problem but doesnt solve it' is a useful interim or alternative structure to position as the target, when error/solution types are not structural
      - example: 
        - an approximation function improves a 'missing information about dependent variable y' problem but doesnt solve it (the 'actual prediction function for y' would solve it)
        - a buoy improves a 'drowning' problem but probably doesnt solve it (a 'method of getting to land' would solve it, which the buoy is unlikely to be except in rare contexts or with extreme/distorted/stretched definitions)
        - a 'fitting structure' improves a 'gap' problem but doesnt solve it (a 'method of preventing & correcting gaps' would solve it, like a 'method of preventing slices/knots & other structures that qualify as gap error types')

    - generate problem/solution structures in a problem space or a system to include/exclude those structures to find solution structures

      - example: generate problem structures of a problem space like 'find a function for an intent' to filter out those structures to find solution structures
          
          - apply error type definition routes
            - error type: missing component
              - if this error type is relevant to the problem space, that means the component was relevant in some way (like being required)
          
          - apply error type-generating functions
            - error type-generating functions:
              - 'change components'
                - components
                  - variable values
                    - inputs
                      - to generate a problem type of 'missing input', apply 'change' function or 'opposite' structure to 'input' structure
                    - attribute values
                     - to generate a problem type of 'missing attribute' (such as an attribute required for a solution metric), apply 'change' function or 'opposite' structure to 'attribute' structure

    - apply solution variable interaction rules as a way of generating/filtering solutions
        - example: 'solution variable reusability tends to contradict solution variable specificity, so avoid solutions with high reusability when a custom/new solution specific to a problem is required'

    - identify overlap of problem/solution definitions (when a problem is a solution and vice versa) to identify contexts where a problem should be framed as a solution instead & solution structures should be applied (like solution metrics or insights like causes of why it works for a problem) instead of problem structures (like questions to change/resolve it)
    
    - identify solution spaces based on problem/solution attributes
        - pre-filter solution space by identifying structures in a system that fulfill general solution metrics (efficiency, reusability, etc & structures like combinations of these) to reduce the solution set to search for specific problems

    - generate/find/derive structures (like combinations) of a solution automation workflow's core interaction function structure (connection, reduction, removal, building) & construct (probable, relevant, useful, adjacent, interactive, efficient) solutions from those, then use as a default solution space to search
        - example: function sequences & state sequences can be used as components of a 'connecting' solution automation workflow that connects origin/target structures

    - generate alternative solution automation workflow insight paths with an interface query to find aligning functions like 'reduce differences' (of problem/solution) for functions like 'connect differences' (of problem/solution), given supported function intents for 'reduce' and 'connect' functions, in cases where 'connect' functions are not available or optimal
          - identify 'connect' function inputs
            - requirement that a distance exists that needs to be traversed from origin to target (to solve the general problem intent of 'moving from origin to target')
          - identify cause of problem
            - cause: 'distance between origin & target'
          - identify functions that solve cause of problem & check if they have side effects that maintain the problem or if they solve the problem
            - 'distance-reduction' functions are relevant to solve the cause of this problem (the distance between origin & target)
              - 'reducing' the distance to traverse is one way of implementing the general intent of 'moving from origin to target'
              - 'reducing' the cost of travel is another way of implementingn the general intent of 'moving from origin to target'

    - apply different but aligning solution automation workflow interaction rules (connect/reduce) to implement the original workflow ('connect workflow & problem system using interface query')
      - example:
        - reduce difference between problem/solution by selecting a space where they are adjacent
          - rather than applying 'connect' functions to connect the problem/solution format, apply 'find' to 'system' components to fulfill a related aligning intent of applying 'reduce' to the problem-solution differences, thus reducing the need for 'connect' functions by default

      - example: what does this mean for the 'find a prediction function' problem?
        - 'find a space that reduces differences' implementation workflow could be implemented as follows, connected to the 'to identify difference causes & solutions in each diemnsion set from each dimension change' as a way to connect to general intent of 'find a prediction function'
          - find dimension set where problem/solution are equal
          - change dimension set until problem/solution are increasingly different
            - each dimension change is a possible cause of problem/solution difference
            - find solutions to each difference type in that dimension set

        - dimension sets could include formats like:
          - probability distribution
          - series/sequence or area format
          - adjacent functions
          - function subsets
          - core functions
          - type point sets
          - root sets/patterns of various adjacent functions
          - function patterns

    - iterate through applying interfaces to solution automation workflows to generate solution automation workflows
      
      - apply logic interface to identify interaction rules between problem/solution components given their definitions, to create workflows by applying those interaction rules to connect problems/solutions (or apply another interaction function than 'connect')
      
      - apply change interface
        - vary variables that workflows have in common & differ on, including variables implicit to the definition of a solution automation workflow:
          - derive info of varying certainty from other info in an efficient & effective way
          - apply structure to info to generate a particular certainty (like an answer to a question, such as a particular solution to a problem)
            - apply structure to adjacent info to generate filters/limits to derive info about the structure of the target solution, if direct info cant be derived (like patterns or solutions to similar but not equal problems)
          - resolve the tension (difference) of the uncertainty in some way, for example:
            - first break the problem into sub-problems, then return it to its original format once sub-solutions are solved by integrating/aggregating them
            - connecting the differences between a problem/solution with connecting formats
        
      - apply system optimizations like 'minimize cost' to problem-solving workflows (like how 'minimize cost' is an optimization that solves the info problem of 'solving a problem with minimal info') to identify associated functions/structures for that system optimization intent & associated problem structure (once an interface like the info interface is applied so the system optimization can be applied)
      
      - apply standard solution automation workflow generator workflow based on aligning functions to sub-problem intents
        - apply 'identify pattern' function to identify & isolate common structures in prior problem-solving workflows to form a pattern
        - apply 'identify useful system components' function to identify useful system components to fulfill intents more efficiently/optimally
        - apply 'abstract' function to generalize to all problems
      
      - apply function interface to identify core functions or generative functions or vertex functions relevant to solution automation workflows & apply them to generate them
      
      - apply solution automation workflows to the problem of 'generating solution automation workflows'
      
      - apply system interface to identify useful system structures like efficiencies in prior problem-solving paths & apply the pattern interface to patterns in those efficiencies to generalize them to other problems
      
      - apply abstract & info & structure interfaces to identify in what interface to resolve sub-problems or other components of a solution automation workflow, given that interfaces vary on their core structure & their certainty structures
        - core function interface structure: input/output, interaction rule sequence
          - logic interface (higher certainty variant of the function interface) is applied as an interaction function filter (to identify/generate/derive interaction functions)
          - pattern interface (lower certainty variant of the function interface, without certainty structures like input/output providing specific contextual info)
        - core abstract interface structure: cross-system attribute with varying structures by system
          - info interface (higher certainty variant of the abstract interface) is applied to identify the relevant structure of concepts applicable to a specific system
        - core cause interface structure: a determining input
          - intent interface (a higher certainty variant of the cause interface) is a determining input for a structure like a function (reason to use a function)
      
      - apply intent interface to generate solution automation workflows
        - definition of 'intent' is 'reason to use something' which is related to cause, so intents can be used as a info source of optimization functions (bc intents are often used bc they optimize for a particular goal), and apply optimization functions to optimize problem system, optimize problem-solution connection, optimize a solution for solution metrics, or optimize another problem/solution component interation
    
        - identify useful structures for varying intents in a system (like a particular problem system) and assume some component is using those structures especially if theyre useful to multiple components/intents
          - example: 
            - for the intent 'minimize cost' applied to problem-solving ('solve problem with minimal input info'), the associated problem-solving function is 'derive info', which requires functions that can generate relatively high info from low input, producing the workflow:
              - 'identify high-output, low-input (low-cost) structures in info processing to form set of default structures to check for in deriving info from minimal info'
        
    - apply solution automation workflow core interaction functions to the problem of 'generating solution automation workflows'
        - examples:
          - apply 'reduce' to the problem
            - find reduced variable set (vertex variables) of the problem & find solutions that address the problematic values of these variables
          - apply 'connect' to the problem/solution
            - find interface components that connect the problem & solution like standards so they can be compared, format/function sequences, and structures of connections
          - apply 'convert' to the problem
            - convert the problem into a more solvable problem, like a set of sub-problems or a related problem or a causative problem
          - apply 'structurize/define' to the problem/solution
            - apply structures to the problem/solution given their definitions
            - apply structures to connect their explicit definitions given the implicit components (implications/possibilities/probabilities) of their definitions

    - generate solution automation workflows by identifying structures of problem type causes through varying problem/solution component structures

        - problem type of 'excess specificity' can cause a problem of 'false success info signals'

          - granular/specific solutions are often insufficient, where the granularity can take the form of problem structures like:
            
            - handling problematic output instead of input: fixing a specific instance of a problem (an output generated by a problem-generating function call, like a particular position of a problem side effect) instead of all instances of a problem (the problem-generating function)
            - position on a problem network: fixing a problem without regard to other related problems, such as causative problems, adjacent problems, or problems that will replace or re-generate the problem once its fixed/removed
            - specific instance of a type: fixing a specific type of a problem instead of all possible types
            - multiple intents: fixing one particular problematic usage of a function, without fixing other problematic uses of a function
            - lack of unique cause: fixing one cause of a multi-cause problem without fixing other causes
            - artificial constant: assigning one constant value when a variable is required to fix the problem
            - unhandled potential: fixing the problematic function without handling the adjacent problematic function it can be adjacently converted into
            - unhandled context: fixing the problem in a particular problem space context, without handling the adjacent problem space the original problem space is about to become
            - specific state: fixing the problem for a specific state in a data flow rather than all possible states
            - specific success definition: fulfilling one metric when multiple metrics are needed to assess solution success

        - you can generate the above problem structures (like 'multiple intents') for a problem type by:
          
          - applying interface components to the problem type concept of 'specificity' (with general problem type 'excess' applied to this concept for a resulting problem type 'excess specificity') in useful (common/general/interface) problem spaces like 'finding a function'
          - then filtering the resulting structures by which structures would qualify as problems, given the definition routes of the concept of 'problem' (like 'structures that are sub-optimal for some legitimate intent, like fulfilling a particular metric')
          
        - identify structures relevant to a problem type, by applying alternate useful problem/solution components (like alternate problem spaces to 'finding a function', such as the alternate problem space 'finding a connection structure')

          - where a 'problem space' can be the context associated with having a problem, like how the problem space of the problem of 'finding a function' is the set of systems where that problem would occur, systems potentially including a network of related problems like 'finding connections' and 'predicting outputs' such as:
          
          - examples of problem spaces specific to an interface:
            - cause: find cause (as an indirect input to a function)
            - structure: find limits/filters of function inputs/logic
            - system: find assumptions of function (as a related input to a function)
          
          - generate problem/solution components like 'alternate useful problem spaces' by applying interface components (like applying 'abstraction' concept to the 'finding a function' problem space to create the abstract version 'finding a structure')
            
            - apply 'abstraction' concept to the 'finding a function' problem space to create the abstract version
              - problem space: finding/fitting a structure
              - apply intent component & related concepts like 'useful':
                - generated problem space: 'finding a useful structure for an intent'
              - apply 'abstraction' concept to 'structure' ('definition' is an abstraction of 'structure', just like 'constant' or 'info' are other abstractions of 'structure')
                - problem space: finding a definition
               - apply 'abstraction' to all components until it reaches the 'interface' interaction level
                - find an interface component in a structure ('find a concept like relevance in a structure')
            
            - apply 'interface' interface concepts ('organization' being a related concept of 'structure' & 'interface', just like 'integration' and 'relevance' are related concepts of the 'interface' interface, where concepts related to 'disorder' like 'random' are the opposing concepts of 'organization') to interface components ('structures')
              - organize/randomize structures
            
            - apply abstract core 'info' interface components related to the abstraction of the problem (like problem/solution types, formatted as abstract core functions), instead of a specific problem's ('find connecting function') component interaction structures ('functions connecting input-output')
              - select between solution types (generate/derive/find)
            
            - apply 'combination' structure and 'complete' concept and 'system context' component
              - find all the possible ways to connect two structures & all the info structures necessary to connect them with those methods
            
            - apply 'interaction' concept to 'connection' structure
              - find all the possible structures (like networks) that could convert a 'find a connection between input-output' problem into a 'integrate input-output connection methods with these other structures so they can coexist' problem
                - example: 'find a function' problem can interact with a network of problems, like the 'prevent logic injection' problem, 'prevent execution interruption' problem, etc, so it becomes a problem structure that is not simply finding a connecting path between inputs/outputs but a layered network structure of 'finding the connecting structures, while preventing interfering interactions from this problem network'

    - apply error types to generate solution filters
      - 'false association without associated meaning' error type
        - just bc one item has both associative & distributive attributes doesn't mean another item with an associative attribute also is distributive
        - it would be incorrect to associate these attributes in the absence of meaning (relevance & context) connecting them with high-certainty (logic/info/definition) structures
          - multiplication can be done in any order bc its the same operation (find the area of the same shape)
          - division cant be done in any order bc the operation is 'apply a standard' where the standard is the base, so when the base changes, the operation meaning changes
          - generated solution filter:
            - if there is no reason to change the order, like a change in intended meaning of the operation, the order shouldnt be changed

    - generate implementations of problem/solution components (like 'core interaction functions')

      - identify relevant concepts to the core interaction function
        - 'similarity' is relevant to 'connect' function

      - identify structure (like position) of concepts, in relation to the core interaction function and the problem/solution components
        - 'input problem components of "connect" function acquire more "similarity" to the solution output components'

      - apply structures of that concept to relevant components
        - generate & apply relevant structures (similarity/equivalence structures) between input/output components:
          - apply similarity/equivalence structures to implement a 'problem-solution connecting' function
            - standardize structures (like sequential structures such as time), standardizing to either system's structures, interim structures, similarity structures, common structures, interface (like system or core) structures, contextual system-containing system's structures, etc
            - abstract to patterns (like type, cause, system structures)
            - conversion functions (like remove, apply, connect, define)

    - apply core structures of the structural interface (like origin/destination points, loops, layers, boundaries, & paths) as interaction functions of problem/solution components (like problems such as 'logistical resource allocation', 'adding variable to a function for an intent', or 'finding an optimal search path (sorting or network traversal problem)') to generate solution automation workflows or components of them, like useful default problem/solution structures such as:
        - a question/variable/cause connection pattern
        - a connected function sequence
        - a set of solution/error-finding filters & limits

    - identify the error type relevant to problem/solution interaction level components of a specific problem space error type, and apply a solution automation workflow to correct the problem/solution error type on the specific interaction level or vice versa
      - example:
        - to handle a nn error when its original training set factors have a 'missing variable' error type:
          - apply 'alternate' structures to fix 'missing' error type:
            - alternate variable sets to generate predictions to use in cases without information
          - apply 'change' structures to fix 'missing' error type:
            - apply distortion structures (like distortion sets/sequences) to connect variable subsets with a particular prediction function to handle missing variables
          - apply 'variable' structures to identify variables of 'alternate prediction function variables'
             variables, variable operations & variable structures that can be applied to generate more accurate predictions, given a lack of information

        - these structures can generate a connection between the variable subset that is missing some variables when the 'missing variable' error type occurs, leaving the problem input independent variables & solution output dependent variable with a 'unconnected' error type
        - the problem/solution interaction level component error type is 'unconnected', which is resolvable with a 'connect' interaction function to resolve the specific error type 'missing variable' on the interaction level of the specific error type ('connect' components on the 'variable' interaction level to solve the problem/solution interaction level error type 'unconnected')

    - apply interface structures (like 'logical implications') to solutions and/or associated error types to derive the origin component type (problem, cause), to generate new solution automation workflows
      - given solutions (with associated error types solved by the solution), derive what problem types existed to trigger the application of the solution (can be constructed from those error types, where error types can cause/build the original problem or address sub-problems of the original problem or related problems)
      - example:
        - given that an agent delegates instead of trying to solve a problem, it is implied that: 
          - 'their previous alternate solution methods have caused error types rather than resolving them'
          - 'delegation has worked for them before'
          - the fact that either of these are likely explanations can be derived with additional information like:
            - their decision patterns
            - adjacent information like:
              - 'having more info about delegation processes'
              - 'more info about alternate solution method error types than delegation error types'
        - given an error type of "delegation problems (like 'misallocation', 'uneven distribution of work', or 'micromanagement')", we can infer that:
          - 'alternate solutions to delegations have been tried'
          - 'delegation was an adjacent solution at the time of solution selection'
          - 'this is a problem not suited to delegation'
          - 'excess work requirements is an origin problem type'
          - 'delegation has been applied as a solution to excess work requirements'


#### core interaction functions

    - identify & apply useful interface components for various problem/solution core interaction functions
        - 'reduce': identify functions that reduce the work of other functions if executed in a particular function structure
          - examples:
            - 'standardizing functions' reduce the work of 'comparison functions'
            - 'type identification functions' reduce the work of 'differentiation functions'
            - 'pattern identification functions' reduce the work of 'prediction function identification functions'
            - 'variable interaction identification functions', 'important variable identification functions', and 'cause identification functions' reduce the work of 'finding prediction function functions'
        - 'connect': identify connective/interactive functions for 'connect problem/solution' intents

    - identify structures convertible to input of specific core interaction functions (like connect/reduce) or associated solution automation workflows & apply those functions specifically to those structures in a structure like a function sequence/network, rather than:
          - randomly applying core interaction functions to problem/solution structures
          - applying a specific core interaction function & associated solution automation workflow
          - applying a core interaction function structure as a general static method

    - apply optimization or core interaction function structures/intents (like 'reduce') to optimize & generate solution automation workflows for solving the problem of finding interaction structures (like 'differences') between solution structures (like optimal structures) & default/input structures (like the whole solution space such as 'all possible combinations')
        - apply 'reduce differences' intent to fulfill intent of 'finding optimal structures efficiently':
          - differences between the solution space & ethical solution structures
          - differences between the solution space & abstract solution structures
          - patterns of differences or difference types between the solution space & optimal structures
        - this works bc of the definition of various definitions of optimal, like how 'ethics' means 'what should occur', as in 'unenforced rules for filtering a solution space of possible decisions to navigate complex decisions that are not governed by enforced rules', such as 'fulfill responsibilities' being an ethical structure that can guide system optimization

    - apply core interaction functions to relate problem/solution components, by applying core interaction structures (relevant to core general abstract-intent functions like apply/find/build/organize/derive)

      - core interaction functions include: fill, reduce, connect, remove, filter, identify, combine, merge, convert, define/structurize

      - the relevant (meaning core/causative/determining/abstract/invalidating) difference type between the problem/solution can point to an adjacent function to correct the difference
      - example for problem 'too many variables (too much complexity)' and solution 'method of reducing variables without losing accuracy or robustness'
        - a core difference type between problem & solution: variable count
        - a causative difference type: lack of understanding
        - a determining difference type: whether additional variables add accuracy or robustness
        - an abstract difference type: whether these function types (a complex prediction function and a variable reduction function) can interact without additional changes (a variable reduction function can be a generator of a prediction function)
        - an invalidating difference type: whether complex & simple solution types (function types) can both be useful for the same problem

      - core problem-solution interaction types:
        - organize
          - position
            - the solution is the problem components in the right position in a structure (like an object-function or variable network)
          - sequence: 
            - the problem is the solution with a 'sort' applied
        - apply
          - usage (space used vs. allowed by structure)
            - gap: 
              - the problem is the solution with a 'gap' error type corrected
              - the solution is the removal of the problem 
              - the solution resolves the problem of a lack
            - limit
              - the solution is some change applied to the problem that doesnt intersect with a limit or exist on a particular side of the limit
          - change
            - the solution is some structure of change applied to the problem
          - context
            - the solution is some context applied to the problem, so that the problem is not a problem
        - find
          - identify
            - inclusion/exclusion
              - subset/set: (partial/complete)
                - the solution is the problem with a 'filter' applied (a subset of the problem)
                - core structure
                  - the solution is the core components of the problem
              - group (combination):
                - the solution is some combination of problem components
            - fit (count/value)
              - reduce/expand
                - the solution is a subset/superset of the problem variables
                - abstract structure:
                  - the solution is an example/type of the problem
            - comparison:
              - equal (balance):
                - the solution is some change applied to the problem and/or solution that equates the solution to the problem (as opposed to 'connecting' the problem/solution)
                - connect (path): 
                  - solve the problem by connecting the problem & the solution
              - difference structure:
                - the solution is differences between the solution & the problem reduced/expanded or added/removed (as opposed to 'connecting' the problem/solution)
                - opposite: 
                  - the problem is the opposite of ('not') the solution
                  - the solution is different from error structures
                - invalid
                  - the solution is a lack of a valid version of the problem in the problem space (the problem cant exist in the problem space given a definition of 'valid' including validation rules)
                - undefined
                  - the solution is a lack of problem definition (the problem is abstract rather than clearly defined, or structural, in the problem space)
                - empty
                  - the solution is a lack of the problem (the problem has no possible value in the problem space)
              - similarity (alignment):
                - the solution is some change applied to the problem that convert the problem into a useful component (an alignment with a useful intent)
                - the solution makes the origin position more similar to the target position
                - the solution is some coordinating structure (like a complement) with the problem that converts the problem into a non-problem
        - build/cause:
          - input/output      
            - the solution is some change applied to the problem that produces or is produced by a structure (like an interaction)
            - origin/target structure (sub-structure of input/output)
              - the solution is some change that resolves the difference (reduces distance) between origin/target, connects origin/target, or makes conversion between origin/target trivial
              - the solution is changing the origin or target position/structure so the problem is more solvable or reduced
        - derive
          - abstract reverse input/output direction
            - the solution is the generalized path from an example solution to the problem definition

      - example of applying core interaction functions to relate problem & solution components
        - example problem: find a prediction function
          - reduce:
            - useful for solving problems of excess, like fitting over-sized shapes inside containers
            - reduce 'find a prediction function' problem to a problem of 'find variables that change output variable' problem
            - reduce number of data points or variables to solve related problems
          - remove:
            - useful for solving problems of excess, like over-prioritization or excess complexity
            - remove complicating/variance-adding attributes like nonlinearity of a standard prediction function created with various regression methods, until the prediction function is a set of linear functions, and combine variables to predict those functions for the relevant ranges
            - remove variables from data set until prediction function is found for each subset & apply weights to the subset functions to find the prediction function
            - remove randomness structures like outliers & corrupt points from data set to make the prediction function more representative
            - remove any neutralizing/opposite structures that counter each others' effects from the data set/variables
          - fill:
            - useful for solving problems of lack (like filling a template)
            - create local prediction functions to fill out the template leaving space for the whole prediction function
          - convert:
            - useful for solving problems of problem-solving inefficiency for the original problem, or lack of inputs to original problem solution
            - convert 'find a prediction function for data set' problem to another problem like 'find a representative/average function for data set'
          - structurize:
            - useful for solving problems of uncertainty that require applying structure to create certainties
            - connect variable/function/data structures (like a subset of functions, variables, or data points) to create a prediction function
            - create a template leaving space for a prediction function using filters as limits/boundaries of the template (like a rectangle or other shape within which the prediction function is likely to be)
          - connect:  
            - useful for solving problems of difference
            - connect variables with a line representing a majority of data points
        - some of these solution automation workflows applied to the problem may be equivalent/interchangeable and may generate equivalent/similar interface queries or solutions
        - some are more adjacent to the original problem format or the target solution format or both than others


### apply known useful structures for problem-solving intents

    - apply known useful structures like the following, to relate/optimize problem/solution components:
      - definitions
      - input-output connecting sequences/networks
      - implementation structures (of a more abstract/less certain structure)
      - solution/error structures
      - solution filters
      - relevance structures (alternates/proxies/substitutes/approximations/improvements/optimizations/adjacents/power)
      - generative functions
      - solution success causes
      - core interaction functions
      - interaction level structures between inputs/outputs
      - alternate/interim inputs/outputs
      - mapping functions between inputs/outputs or systems

    - identify the position/structure of certainties & uncertainties in the problem system & apply structures in the positions of certainties & remove structures in the positions of uncertainties to resolve their connections & apply changes until the structures fit the problem system and a solution is defined

    - apply solution automation workflows (like 'break into sub-problems & integrate sub-solutions') & useful interface structures (like 'adjacent conversions') to generate solution automation workflows
      - break the problem into related sub-problems, find a solution to a sub-problem, and apply that solution to the other sub-problems, adjusting as necessary to fit to the other sub-problems with adjacent conversion functions
          - this works indirectly bc of similarity of structures in a system which are similar so they can interact (they exist on the same interaction level, so one is likely to be adjacently derivable from the other as theyre likely to have common core components), or directly bc of similarities in interactive structures like related problems

    - filter interaction structures that dont contradict relevant interactions in the problem system or the solution system (or adjust solution system if not required to be in its original format), determining relevance by whether the components are interactive with or are vertex variables (causative/generative/descriptive) of the problem/solution components, and build possible solutions out of these filtered interaction structures

    - find vertex variables of differences (certainty/uncertainty, equal/opposite, structural/abstract) and apply as structures to fulfill problem-solving intents (like problem-solution core interaction functions or solution filters)

    - identify interaction structures between efficiently measurable interface components (like 'error structures' on the structural interface) and the efficient indicator that is an input to quick connections to solutions (error types, with which you can query for solutions associated with those error types & efficiently find a probably good solution)
        - solution input structures with adjacent/efficient connections to solutions
          - error types
          - problem/solution difference structures & difference types
          - problem types
          - problem-solution connection function structures (which is the set of core interaction functions, including 'reduce', 'remove', 'connect')
        - efficiently measurable interface components of solution input structures with adjacent/efficient connections to solutions
          - type input structures (group, difference)
          - problem input structures (difference, imbalance, mismatch, misalignment, lack/excess - and solution structures like requirements to identify what is a problem)
          - solution input structures (requirements, similarity/equalizing, connection, match, alignment - and problem structures like errors with available error-solution connection info or connection derivation function)
          - difference type input structures (adjacent structure capturing the most info of the difference that is different from existing different types)
          - problem-solution connection function structure input structures (sub-problem type structure like a sequence/network, relevant (adjacent) difference structures)
        - this works bc once efficiently measurable components are connected to efficient solution inputs, you have a reliable efficient path to a solution that works by combining efficiencies in a sequential structure to connect them & connect inputs/outputs

    - apply problem-solution interaction functions (like 'difference-reduction' or 'efficient path-finding' or 'organization' functions) to relate interface components (like efficiencies) which align with the connection function intents that can form a connecting interaction structures (like a function input/output structure) that can take problem structures as inputs & create solution structures as outputs

    - identify & apply functions to generate useful system components like efficiencies (or causes of these components) that help fulfill intents in general & apply to problem-solving intents
        - example of efficiency-generating functions to fulfill problem-solving intent of connecting problem/solution
          - function to position source/destination positions in a more adjacent position
          - function to reduce differences or their causes
          - function to remove differences or their causes
          - function to connect any differences efficiently, making a high or complete ratio of differences trivial

    - identify interaction structures between error structures (like difference structures) & the associated error types of those error structures, and use connecting structures to identify error types or error structures in a system/structure
        - example: 
          - error type: 'one incorrect difference type causes another incorrect difference type'
            - error structure: 'alignment in incorrect difference types'
            - connecting structure: 
              - 'alignment in incorrect difference types indicates a relationship between the difference types'
              - 'causes are one type of relationship'
              - generated error type: 'one incorrect difference type causes another incorrect difference type'
          - error type: 'one incorrect difference type has an error type of "extreme difference" from another incorrect difference type'
            - error structure: 'difference in possibly related incorrect difference types (related by possible unrelated connection, like adjacence or group membership)'
            - connecting structure: 
              - 'extreme difference in incorrect difference types indicates a possible error (incorrect difference type) between the errors (incorrect difference types)'
              - 'errors can have errors in their connections (they can be incorrectly different from each other, as in they should be aligned)'
              - 'error structures (of difference) include extreme differences'
              - generated error type: 'one incorrect difference type has an error type of "extreme difference" from another incorrect difference type'

    - apply 'interactivity' structures as a solution filter or solution component filter
      - predict interactivity & interaction output of structures to find interactive structures to use as components to fulfill problem-solving intents like 'core interaction function' intents (like 'connect') of problem/solution, without computing every interaction to quickly identify probable interactions & probable interaction attributes like their output
          - interactivity based on:
            - whether a component can use/identify/process/store structures of the other
            - whether structural alignments/similarities/matches exist between the structures so they can attain emergent attributes like position and form structures of coordination & combination
            - whether structures have variations on the same interaction level
            - interface components like cause (origin position) and intent (direction, destination position) of the structures leading to structures like angle/point of interaction
            - structural system-related attributes like stability of the structures
            - error types handled by the structures
    
    - identify useful structures (like interaction level structures between inputs/outputs, alternate/interim inputs/outputs, or mapping functions between inputs/outputs) of alternate solution tools (like ai algorithms or math like regression) and find/apply alternative solution structures that generate those useful structures to map original problem inputs to solution outputs
        - example: 
          - interaction level structures of ai algorithms include:
            - filters
            - functions
            - probabilities
              - apply structures that generate info about probabilities of input-output interactions and apply as info-filtering network structures between original problem input & solution output
                - a trained ai model gives data about probabilities of outputs given inputs
                - other sources of probability info of outputs for a given input structure (like an intent/context/function) can be generated from certainty & uncertainty-resolution structures (like patterns)
                  - example for predicting outputs like occurrence/usage/interaction, as a way of filtering structures for an intent:
                    - interactive structures are more likely to be connected in a 'system, integration, or combination' structure
                    - structures that follow common patterns or similarities are likelier to occur in structures for common intents
                    - simple/efficient structures are likelier to occur in a 'new, stabilized, or optimized system' structure
                    - structures that use the same core structures are likelier to occur in a 'system' structure
                    - stable structures are likelier to be used as a 'foundation' structure or 'building' intents
                    - standardizing structures are likelier to be used for 'info exchange' intents
                    - core structures are likelier to be used for 'generating' intents
                - this applies the ai workflow of 'assigning probabilities for outputs given inputs' to the solution automation problem of 'assigning probabilities to structures for a general output problem-solving intent (like filtering relevant structures) given input structures'
                - this works bc any general filtering method is a possible solution automation workflow bc 'filter' is a core interaction function between problems/solutions

    - identify alternate structures than info that can act as an input-output interaction structures (like 'connection' structures) or another core interaction function applied to problem/solution structures (or abstract or proxy versions of them like inputs/outputs) and solve the problem of applying core interaction functions (generating/connecting/filtering) to alternate structures instead & apply alternate structures to apply core interaction functions (like connect) to original problem inputs/outputs
        - examples of alternative structures to info:
          - probability
          - interactive structures
          - uncertainty-resolution structures 
            - including solution automation functions like:
              - 'convert to abstract interface to resolve uncertain connections & convert to original interface to resolve implementation once abstract connections are resolved'
          - logic/functions to connect inputs/outputs
          - info filters
          - info derivation/generation functions
          - info components
        - generate (or find & map) solution automation workflows that can generate these alternate structures & apply them to generate these alternate structures as a solution to map inputs/outputs
          - example of a solution automation workflow that can generate these alternate structures:
            - 'apply power of interactivity to find interaction structures of an info alternative structure (like probability) and connect them to connect problem inputs/outputs with the info alternative structures'
        - this works bc of the definition of 'alternate' applied to solution automation workflow inputs like info structures

    - apply structures of power (which tend to overlap with 'useful system components' bc of the definition of 'useful/relevant') to solution automation workflow components (like inputs, core interaction functions, or implementation variables)
        - structures of power include:
          - alternative structures
          - efficiency structures
          - organization/integration structures
          - connection/interaction structures
          - filter structures
          - distribution structures
          - alignment structures
          - certainty structures
        - these structures are powerful because they enable other components (like functions such as 'storage' by reducing need for storing other structures)
        - this works bc of the definition of 'power' (as an 'root or causal input' or 'input enabling (distributing power to) other components' or a 'resource-distribution function') applied to problem/solution interaction functions

    - apply useful structures (like 'optimization' structures) across problem/solution/interface structures with system optimization structures (like 'structural alignments', such as the 'structural alignment' between problem 'system' and optimal 'system' structures)
      - apply the structure of an 'optimal' system by fitting the problem system to the optimal system & identifying adjacent conversion functions between them to 'connect' them, given that they have a 'structural alignment'
    
    - apply structures of 'efficiency' to generate solution automation workflows
          - structures of efficiency include:
            - structural alignments (delay operations requiring iteration until the next required iteration)
              - generated workflow:
                - connect structures that are otherwise difficult to connect by creating efficiencies with structural alignments to connect problem/solution
            - low cost (low input, high output) structures
              - generated workflow:
                - find functions with low input & high output and apply where possible to connect/reduce difference between problem/solution
            - interactive structures like function sequences
              - generated workflow:
                - find interactive structures in solution automation workflow system components (solution space, problem definition, related problems, problem types) & organize them in their interactive structures
            - paths using fewer resources
              - generated workflow:
                - find paths between problems & solutions that use fewer resources and use those paths where possible
            - storing generative info rather than original info
              - generated workflow:
                - store generative info sets of a solution (or related component like solution input) instead of specific solutions to generate solutions as needed
                - store generative info sets (for alternate causal variable sets) of a problem to find problem causes quickly

    - generate solution automation workflows by applying useful structures (like 'optimization' structures) to interface structures (like 'systems') between interfaces or interface components to connect problem/solution components
      - generate solution automation workflows by applying system optimization structures (like efficiencies such as interactivities) between interfaces or interface components to connect problem/solution components
          - example: generate alternative abstract 'optimal' system structures to fit to a 'problem' system with adjacent core interaction function-fulfilling functions (like 'conversion functions' to fulfill 'connect' core interaction function)
            - this applies the potential (alternative), conceptual (abstract), system (optimized system), structure, (fit by structures like similarities, adjacence), change (conversion), and function interfaces in a way that allows them to interact to connect problems & solutions
            - this identifies the system containing problem/solution components (problem space, solution space, problem types) as a system to apply system optimizations to

    - interface query types can be an alternative to interface query design
      - use default patterns of interface query types, parameters (like origin interface & input problem type), & input-output connections to identify query types that are useful for solving specific problem types

    - apply default useful/optimal structures determined to be probable determinants of a solution
      - before running an interface query to 'design an interface query to solve the problem' or to 'solve the problem', run default interface queries to solve the problem of 'identifying problem-solution components on the problem interface to determine interface query solution metrics for designing the problem-solving interface query'
        - if the problem interface queries produce enough info, the problem interface may occasionally be the only interface required to solve the problem, like when known solutions are known to be optimal for the problem type & solve the problem when applied in a simulation of the problem space
        - problem interface contains rules to fulfill intents like:
          - 'identify when solution metrics need to change bc an assumption (whether an implicit assumption derived from implication of problem, or an explicit assumption) was built on false info type (like lack of info, incorrect object identities, incorrect format)''
 
   - identify & apply default useful/relevant structures of solution structures (like 'organization') that fulfill solution structure intents ('organization' intents like 'integrate interface objects for a problem type')
    - example:
      - default useful structures for solving a 'find variable connection' problem
        - variable structure in a common format or standard format with connection structures (network) 
        - applying structures like:
            - equal as a base function to generate the origin network structure differences (position)
            - causal direction
            - type
            - core functions as sub-components

    - how to generate a standard useful cross-interface structure of 'organization'
      - find connection change structures (variables):
        - type is relevant bc variable types have direct connections (like 'variable of one data type like boolean likely to be connected to another variable of a data type like condition')
      - find connection core structures (components):
        - core functions are relevant to build new connections where info is missing about a connection
      - find connection interface or structure structures (standards, filters):
        - equal positions of variables are likelier to find differences (distortions from equal) faster than starting from an extreme positioning function
      - find connection structures associated with interfaces (direction structure associated with intent):
        - causal direction is directly defined to be relevant in the 'connection' definition, which implies an input/output connection, inputs being liked to 'dependency', which is linked to 'cause'
    
    - filter components by uniqueness in structure & usage to derive default reliable/useful structures to apply as an 'apply default interface structures' solution automation workflow
      - derive a set of functions to solve all problems by:
        - generating a 'difference type-handling function' selection function
        - identifying unique difference/error types & generating functions to handle those difference types, so when one fails, another can be selected
        - generating a function to identify new difference types (in the set of functions, in itself, in solution metrics, and other component combinations)
      - this function set & its alternate versions will reflect possible versions of the forces of an accurate (effectively predictive) physics model
      - which function set is the real function set (or the function set describing or determining reality) is probably an invalid question, as different function set versions are relevant in different contexts having different probabilities that may even change if function set versions have forces governing them so they change over time, as may the central origin function set representing the base for distortions, and different function sets may have different roles in generating/determining/describing reality
      - the 'true' format of reality may not involve just a function set, but rather a function set with other structures (like specific inputs/outputs, a network of function sets, a set of change functions to the function sets, a set of usages of the function set, etc)

    - identify structures of specific solutions (like 'complexity-reduction' or 'ambiguity-resolution') to specific error types (like 'complexity', 'ambiguity') & apply to fulfill problem-solving intents (like 'core interaction function' intents between problem/solution components)
      - example structures of 'complexity-reduction' or 'ambiguity-resolution' include 'functions with complex inputs & simple outputs'
        - identify complex inputs of simple outputs by injecting a specific interaction rule structure
        - when outputs are simple (lower-dimensional), but can have many different inputs, the outputs will not accurately be usable to determine the inputs without relevant interaction rule structures to inject understanding of input metadata (input interactions, input probabilities, input causes & intents, input contexts, input context interactions/probabilities/causes/intents)
          - examples:
            - if parameters of a function follow a wave function structure, knowing that input structure can help determine the outputs (direction & probable position on the wave), to predict the adjacent/extreme/probable/origin/possible/alternate values of parameters & inferring the wave function parameters
            - low-dimensional outputs like demographic crime stats can be decomposed with a useful interaction rule structure of power interactions
              - power interaction rule structure
                - powerful groups oppress powerless groups
                - powerless groups tend to remain powerless or decrease in power
                - powerful groups try to maintain power but rely on powerless groups as suppliers
                - powerless groups tend to be common, which is an alternate form of power
              - rules about power interactions inform demographic crime data, once the concept of 'power' is inferred as relevant in determining low-dimensional outputs like crime stats
              - inferring the concept of power can take the form of interface queries like:
                - an application of common standard useful concepts like power, efficiency, and balance
                - an application of logical structures like 'implication' & a logical derivation path connecting determining variables of resource distribution differences, which is an implied variable by the position of the data (crime definition routes imply 'lack of resources'), which leads to power difference causes (like simplicity (in visual differences & maintaining the status quo), historical resource transactions)
                - applying definition, structural & error interfaces to identify errors like 'missing structures' to infer the 'lack of specific groups' in crime demographic distribution, and given the negative definition of crime & implied punishment, infer the power of those specific groups to avoid it

          - particularly relevant to deriving inputs from low-dimensional outputs:
            - interaction rules of alternate variable sets or variable value sets
            - interaction rules between causes & alternate variable/value selection

          - how to identify the relevant interaction rule structure (like power interaction rules, or parameter wave function structure interaction rules, or alternate variable set interaction rules) that will quickly help identify inputs to low-dimensional outputs
            - identify when common outputs would benefit multiple intents, where at least one of the multiple intents has a related intent of obscuring inputs
              - power can obscure itself (as well as its input power sources)
              - ambiguity of repeated function structures (like wave function curves, which may obscure the identity of which curve a particular parameter point occupies) is a potential benefit through obscurity

          - solution success cause: this works bc there is usually a minimal number of vertex variables that determine a particular variable interaction, except in extreme cases where inputs are extremely complex alternatives with minimal differentiating variables

    - apply useful structures to problem/solution components (like input sequences & possible implementation structures) to problem/solution components
      - example of identifying useful interface structures (like useful concepts) to apply to problems with specific error types
        - example: 
          - bitcoin and ai both benefit from integrating the concept of time into existing inventions (transaction history, weight updates)
          - solution success cause: why is time (or the structure of sequence) a powerful concept in those problem systems
            - the concept of 'time' applied to problem system structures (historical info integrated into current & imminent info) was a pre-existing 'gap' error type in relevant info structures of the problem system
              - the usefulness of historical info wasnt identified or wasnt identified as integratable into existing inventions
            - related alternative concepts to 'time': 
              - 'connection' could have served as a replacement for 'time', indicating relevance/meaning of previous info once integrated/connected to new/derived info, as states should be connected by the 'state' definition that states are 'different versions of the same object'
              - 'position' could have also replaced 'time' or 'sequence', given the relevance of 'position' as a predictor of financial transactions and connecting one info state to another, given data that can access the destination from that origin
              - 'sequence': its also inherently relevant to know how space-times (states) connect (like in a 'sequence' structure) in order to predict relevant ('adjacent' or 'imminent') space-times (or states) as relevant members of the 'sequence' structure
          
          - solution automation workflow of applying 'input sequences' & 'possible implementation structures' to find solutions
            - identify this solution (of "apply 'time' to generate an improved system to solve problems like 'optimize transactions' or 'automate learning/prediction'")
              - identify relevant structures (like 'input sequences') to target solution structures
                - identify input variables of implementation inputs of target solution structure (like 'prediction function-automating function' or 'transaction-optimizing function')
                  - identify possible implementation inputs of target solution structures
                    - 'learning function sequence' is a possible input of a 'prediction function-automating function'
                      - 'time' is a base input to 'learning function sequence' structures
                    - 'funds verification function' structures are a possible input of a 'transaction-optimizing function'
                      - 'certainty' is an input to 'funds verification function' structures
                        - relevant info that is an input to decisions (such as 'conducting a financial transaction') is connected/stable across adjacent time sequences or adjacent states, creating 'certainty' structures (for which 'stability/consistency' are identifying attributes)

    - apply relevant (interface-generating) structures

        - apply structures (like alternates) relevant to structures that are important bc they generate core/primary interfaces (composability, simplicity) to problem/solution components (apply these structures to solution metric filters, solution automation workflow variables) to generate new solution automation workflows

          - core/primary interfaces are important bc of the core structures that are their generative concepts/structures
            - 'core' interface's generative concept 'simplicity' and related attribute 'composability'
            - 'interface' interface's generative concepts 'interactivity' and 'balance' (how does info from each interface integrate or interact to produce meaning, balancing influence of interfaces in a way thats indicates contribution)
            - 'cause' interface's generative concept 'power' (ability to trigger other components)
            - 'concept' interface's generative concepts 'uniqueness' and 'applicability'
            - 'info' interface's generative concept 'stability' producing info
            - 'intent' interface's generative concepts 'functionality' and 'direction' (functionality develops when there's a reason for it to develop, like a direction of change)
            - 'function' interface's generative concept 'connection' (connecting inputs/outputs)
            - 'pattern' interface's generative concepts 'similarity' (powerful patterns are repeated and patterns develop in similar ways, producing similarities across interfaces)
            - 'logic' interface's generative concept 'alignment' (aligning logical connections with info as a supportive foundation)
            - 'change' interface's generative concept 'difference'
            - 'structure' interface's generative concept 'info' (info about other interfaces with potential for structure)
            - 'potential' interface's generative concept 'adjacence' (what is probable is more adjacent)

            - the generative attributes (simplicity, interactivity, balance, power, uniqueness, applicability, stability, functionality, direction, connection, similarity, alignment, difference, info, adjacence) reflect core structures (unit, value, force, direction, equivalence, distance, rate, ratio, input-output, type, dependency, constant) are fundamental across interfaces

        - apply interface-generating structures like simplicity/normality as a filter to identify relevant insights to apply as filters of problem/solution components like solutions/errors
          - how to identify that more normal language is likelier to contain factual statements
            - multiple connected reasons, from the insight path
              1. facts often have simpler connections
              2. language patterns have intents
                3. agents apply language patterns to achieve intent
                  4. linguistic intents are often to change meaning until its false (out of the full set of intents to 'communicate info')
                  5. agent often over-think how to emphasize/reduce language components and it creates unnatural language patterns
                  6. agent-changed language (newly created patterns) is rarely more efficient than normal language patterns (inherited patterns)
                    7. when it is more efficient, it is quickly adopted until its normal
                    8. more efficient language patterns are likelier to be true, bc of the normally simpler connection patterns of facts 
                  9. it takes work to make a set of falsehoods or mix of falsehoods & facts seems like a fact, and the work has side effects like lack of normality (sounding unnatural in structure) or simplicity (using fewer resources to connect components)
            - relevant concepts
              - the concept of 'simplicity' interacts with connections 1, 5, 8, & 9
              - the concept of 'normality' interacts with connections 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9

            - these concepts can be used as almost interchangeable alternatives in generating the interface query generating this insight path

            - despite their differing definitions, simplicity & normality are connected by the concept of efficiency, because what is simple often becomes normal because of the efficiency of simplicity, so efficiency can be used as an interchangeable concept of both of these in some cases

            - interface query to generate the insight path to 'derive an attribute to identify facts'
              - apply concept interface
                - identify important concepts (simplicity, efficiency, emphasis, reduction, falsehood, change, connection, pattern, normality, agency) of the problem system of 'identify facts'
                - apply relevant concepts to problem system
                  - agents change language to achieve intents
                    - apply intent interface by mapping to intents ('change info' for intent of lying, or 'false similarity to fact')
                      - connect intents to original relevant concepts
                        - connect problem system component derived from intent interface of 'agent-changed language' to concepts of normality & falsehood

    - apply relevant/useful cross-interface structures as problem/solution interaction structures

        - neutralization structures
          - if a problem's outputs neutralize its functionality, that may not be a problem if the neutralizing outputs can be triggered

        - function structures of core interaction functions
          - equalizing/connecting/conversion/comparison structures

        - understanding structures
          - empathy (as a prediction tool bc its an output of understanding)
          - language (as a structural approximator of meaning)
        
        - sufficient/threshold or partial/subset structures (vs. completely aligning structures)
          - requirement structures
          - similarity (approximation/alternative) structures
            - as not all inaccuracies are errors & some level of error can be acceptable in some cases, structures like similarities, proxies, approximations & aligning/adjacent alternatives can take the place of the original problem/solution structures
            - error types that can be useful for more optimal solutions for a metric
              - false similarity
                - where a sub-optimal method has false similarities with an optimal method (like similarities inputs/outputs of another solution, even though its logic differs and other metadata like the reason why it works differs), but the false similarities are all that matters for a particular metric (like having resources to use the sub-optimal method) and it doesnt create side effects that contradict other methods, it can be a temporary/contextually optimal method
        
        - change/learning inputs
          - standard structures
          - cost structures
            - the patterns of costs/benefits as a way to determine investment structures (what alternatives to invest in, for what cause/reason/intent, to what degree, etc) as a way of determining uncertainty resolution
              - investments (exploring a possibility) are a structure of resolving uncertainty problems, like 'exploring very different strategies until one pays off' as a way to find good solutions when selecting between solutions is ambiguous or other structures of uncertainty like lacking in info
              - when an object 'earns' their resources (does the work necessary to acquire them), theyre likelier to be able to maintain those resources & acquire/generate new ones, so theyre likelier to have those resources, as opposed to random distribution of resources
                - if it's earned it's likelier to be a stable structure (a component of truth) bc everything has a benefit/cost (so when the right investment matches the right costs, its likelier to achieve the goal)
        
        - determining/relevance/causation structures
          - power structures
            - the location & interaction of sources of power (like importance, usefulness, interactivity)

    - apply logical interface (including logical component interaction rules & logical components like assumptions) to connect problem/solution components to generate solution automation workflows
      - interaction rule-determining rules
        - similarities
          - equivalents in connections: components of connected rules are equivalent by some metric (interchangeable, equivalent identities, sufficiently similar where differences are irrelevant, etc)
          - definition alignment: applies & aligns with definitions
          - equivalents in meaning: the meaning of a rule in one context (such as the interaction level) is equivalent to the meaning of the rule when applied to another context (it fits into the system the same way so the meaning is the same)
        - includes where possible, except as relevant/required
          - components & structures of certainty like facts where possible, and where not possible, certainty-deriving methods like math/stats & definitions
        - excludes where possible, except as relevant/required
          - uncertainty structures like ambiguities
        - example:
          - patterns are logically a relevant object to prediction functions, given the nature of the problem (predicting a variable with insufficient info, such as info building understanding about the actual variable connections)
    

### apply definitions to generate solution automation workflows

    - apply structures of general/specific solution automation workflow components based on definitions of the components
        - general components include: solution space, solution metrics, solution automation workflow variables, & core interaction functions
          - example:
            - apply a 'interaction space' or 'combination space' rather than a 'solution space'
        - identify relevant different structures for specific solution automation workflow components & iterate through combinations of them, filtering by relevance metrics (like reusability) 
          - apply alternate/proxy/difference structures of definitions of components & iterate through combinations of them
            - examples:
              - apply alternate definition routes of components
                - rather than 'input' structures, apply 'power' structures to solution automation workflows
                - rather than variable structures, apply 'difference' structures
              - apply abstract/specific structures of components
                - rather than 'connect' structures, apply 'sequence' structures
                - rather than 'cause' structures, apply 'inevitability' structures
          - then filter combinations of different structures by which can apply a core interaction function like connect between problem/solution inputs/outputs to optimize for a solution metric filter

   - apply attribute structures of problem/solution components to identify components like errors/solutions
      - attributes of solutions/problems can be used to identify error types & causes of errors
        - if something is unnecessary (not required), it is likely to produce more errors than something that is required
        - if something is highly variable, it is likelier to produce errors than more constant structures
        - if something is inefficient, it is likelier to produce errors than structures that are efficient
        - if something is not aligned with an interacting structure, it is likelier to produce errors than alignments (mismatches, imbalances, incompleteness)
        - if something is highly connective/interactive, it is likelier to produce errors bc it introduces other error-increasing structures like variability
        - if something is reusable, it is likely to be useful, so it has more attributes of a solution than of a problem

    - apply interfaces to generate alternate definitions of useful structures (like "format connection sequence" or "problem-solution interaction functions") to apply as alternate implementations of a solution automation workflow

      - identify attributes of useful structures, like:
        - type stack:
          - format sequence
            - type of structure
            - type of structure that is useful for connecting origin/destination formats 
            - type of structure that is useful for connecting problem/solution formats 
          - solution automation workflow
            - type of insight path
            - type of insight path that is useful for connecting problem/solution
          - insight path
            - useful rule to derive/find/generate insights in a system
          - reverse-engineer solution from problem requirements or opposite structures
            - specific example of a general insight path (like a structural strategy)
        - useful structure connections
          - a format sequence can be used to connect any structures
          - an insight path can be used to connect some structures relevantly/efficiently/usefully (like problem/solution structures, input/output structures, origin/destination structures)
          - a solution automation workflow can be formatted as a format sequence
        - meaning of connections between useful structures
          - 'because a format sequence can be a connecting structure, it can be used to implement functions with 'connecting' intents'

      - change variables to check/complete definitions of problem/solution component interactions
        - variables
          - components used:
            - structures: filters, sequences, formats
              - variables: variable selection sequence
              - structures: format sequence
              - functions: conversion/connecting function sequence
          - origin/destination points
            - connect context to problem/solution:
              - start from system in which problem & solution occur (given solution potential) and fit/connect systems gap structures to problem/solution structures, rather than starting from problem & navigating to solution or connecting them in the middle or working in reverse
            - connect solution components to solution
              - start from existing solution structures & apply filters or other structures to reach solution
            - general form of 'filter connecting sequence': 
              - apply structures of standards such as filters to both/either problem & solution until theyre equal (meaning connected, or similar in structure like position/variables)

    - apply alternate definitions of a structure given the different definitions of 'difference' to generate different solution automation workflows

      - definition routes of 'difference'
        - default
          - adjacence in value
        - proxy
          - adjacence to interim values
          - adjacence to similar values to the different value
        - subset
          - adjacence to different value type or other attribute value
        - opposite
          - lack of equivalence/similarity attributes
        - connections
          - varying adjacent values (adjacent values of one are different from adjacent values of the other)
          - differences in relative values (above/below threshold, near a constant/other number type)
        - potential
          - possible difference (how different can they be, while retaining original information)
        - structure
          - differences in different formats (as a sequence, function, set of determining points)
        - system
          - differences in different spaces (vectors, dimension sets, network graph)
        - change
          - as a unit of change
        - logic
          - as a core connection structure ('x is not y')
        - intent
          - default
            - differences in adjacent/neutral/specific/common uses
          - potential
            - differences in possible uses
        - cause
          - differences in cause

    - apply structures based on their definitions in relation to the definition of a solution/problem or the problem-solving process

        - depending on the solution automation workflow applied, it will involve various functions, like:
          - generate possible solutions & filter
          - break into sub-problems, solve them, & integrate

        - example with a particular solution automation workflow function 'filter':
          - the definition like 'filter' is 'remove items from set based on metric', so functions that support intents like the following sub-functions, which fulfill the 'solution filter' intent (identify if it's a solution or not) can fulfill sub-functions of the 'filter' function definition 'remove items from set based on metric':
            - determining difference
            - determining metric value

        - structures that fulfill the solution automation workflow function, like 'filter':
          - apply opposite structures as a solution filter structure (exclude what a solution is not)
          - apply error structures as a solution filter structure (avoid errors)
          - apply possibility structures as a solution filter structure (exclude impossibilities or improbabilities, include common solutions)

        - structures that fulfill the solution automation workflow function 'solve different problem'
          - apply similar structures as an alternative problem/solution structure or solution base structure (solve alternate similar problem, start from similar origin, base changes on existing solutions)

        - structures that fulfill the solution automation workflow function 'build solution' or 'solve for the components of a solution'
          - apply core structures as a solution subset or solution building structure (build solution from core components or solve subsets (core components) of solution)

        - apply structures of relevance given its definition to identify relevant components for a particular intent like 'solve a problem' or specifically 'generate solution automation workflows', given that relevance is by definition related to the solution automation workflow intent of 'solve a problem'
          - relevant components are:
            - adjacent in interaction degree/directness
            - controllable
            - low-cost to implement
            - specific to that context
            - required/unique
            - enforcing/robust (no matter what changes you make, it will always have an attribute/function)

    - apply definitions & interface structures to identify components that are relevant to solutions (other than primary interface components or interface query or solution automation workflow generating the query)

      - errors (opposite of solutions)
        - assumptions
        - ambiguities
        - mismatches (misalignment, imbalance)

      - connections between solution/problem components & their interaction rules & patterns 
        - patterns of these components' interactions can be used to find solutions
          - connections between:
            - problem & problem space
              - problems created by a problem space defined by a lack of a technology may be resolved by building an adjacent/possible/accessible version of that technology with components that can be replaced with more advanced versions as theyre built
            - solution/problem (the objects or their components/attributes/functions)
              - problem definition & solution metric filters derived from it
                - a problem definition like 'find a prediction function' implies a solution metric filter of 'predictive components of a function (like constants/coefficient values, operations)' so a solution will have components that add to the predictive nature of the variable assembly
              - solution & solution metric filters
                - the solution will fit inside the solution metric filters
                - the solution will fit inside the solution space or be equal to it
              - solution space & problem space
                - these are coordinating structures to generate opposite structures to the problem (the solution)
                  - a problem of 'a difference to resolve' in a problem space where 'difference-opposing structures are uncertain' & the solution space of 'possible methods to resolve the difference (convert it to an equality) given a solution metric', where the solution space is a subset of the problem space or equal to it (until/unless it's filtered)
                  - a problem of 'find a prediction function' (a 'lack of prediction function') in a problem space where 'variable interactions are uncertain' & the solution space of 'possible prediction functions or function-finding methods to equal dependent & independent variables with some accuracy value', where the solution space is 'a subset of all variable interactions, filtered by variables of the problem definition & by possible variable interactions', producing a solution that is the opposite structure of the problem ('a prediction function')
            - solution automation workflow (to design interface query) and actual interface query (to find/derive/build solution)
              - a solution automation workflow like 'connect problem/solution format sequence' has many possible interface queries but they will all be built from conversion operations between formats that connect the problem/solution, whether in a sequence/network or other structure
            - solution automation workflow & solution implementation (output solution generated by interface query)
              - a solution automation workflow like 'connection problem/solution format sequence' can have many possible solution implementations, like:
                - 'connect formats starting from point sets to continuous function format'
                - 'connect variable structures and function structures'
                - 'connect base, subset & combination structures'
                - 'connect prediction structures like clusters with prediction function filters like averages'
            - interface query & solution implementation (output solution generated by interface query)
              - an interface query like 'apply definition interface, then structural interface, then causal interface' can produce many possible solution implementations, like:
                = given the definition of variables/functions/predictions, find their interactive structures & the cause of error structures, and build a solution set that avoids error structure causes using interactive structures'
            
      - possibilities (solution space, alternate problem spaces)

      - uncertainties
        - questions
          - which questions to ask to find/derive/generate which info
        - errors
        - randomness
          - randomness structures must include:
            - contradiction/opposite/neutralization structures so there is an average value to temper extremities
            - many structures of difference so there is a source of difference in their interactions
            - high interactivity between variables
          - possible sources of randomness & variance
            - equivalents generating equal probabilities
            - alignment gaps generating variance injection points
            - alternatives

      - certainties (solution components & filters)
        - requirements (solution requirements as filters/limits)
        - inevitabilities
        - equivalents
        - constants
        - consistencies/stabilities
        - interactivities/coordinations (something is likelier to be true the more it coordinates with current info & adjacent versions of current info)
        - probabilities (approximations of certainty)
          - commonalities
            - averages/centers
          - adjacencies
          - ranges
          - distribution
          - patterns

      - just like you can use error structures to find solutions, you can use certainty structures to find solutions, because:
        - logic relies on certain/probable equivalents to make connections between rules involving equivalent components
        - 'filtering solutions with metrics' relies on calculations determining a certainty in the form of a relationship between actual solution implementation value & optimal solution threshold/filter value & a certain limit in the metric value (a requirement of the solution)
        - uncertainties are more often a source of error than a source of solutions
        - solutions add organization to systems with uncertainty/randomness/chaos, and organization relies on structure (certainty being a proxy of structure bc it is a generator/output of structure)
        - structures (certainties) act like a resource, producing info that can be used for learning
        - certainty is more related to equivalents than errors are (errors being an incorrect/sub-optimal value, or a mismatch between the actual & optimal value)
        - solutions must be built on understanding to be actually robust, and understanding can use certainties as an input
        - if you have enough certainty structures, you can rule out error structures in a system
        - certainty structures interact in a way that can produce other certainties
          - if applied in the right way, incentives can create a guaranteed outcome (where the cost of avoiding the incentives is too high and there isnt a reason to avoid them), generating a certainty, which can be used as a resource (like an assumption that can be relied on to build solutions on top of)
      
  - generate error structures to generate an identification function for a structure by applying the structure's definition to identify structure filters or applying interface structures (like variable interaction structures) to components of the structure's definition
    - example: 
      - generate error structures to generate an identification function (find 'exploit' structures) by applying 'exploit' definition (applying definition attributes as exploit-filtering attributes like 'anomaly', which is an 'unexpected difference given common/normal value patterns' or a 'requirement filter') to identify structure filters, or applying interface structures like variable interaction structures to components of the 'exploit' definition
        - general difference filter (anomaly)
          - non-standard/common data flows
            - 'does data normally follow this pattern'
        - requirement filter
          - 'is there a required basis for sending info'
        - interface structure (variable) interactions to identify possible 'exploit' structures
          - data * time/sequence * usage
            - 'state/content of a data flow intersecting with a possible access chain'
          - code * time/sequence * intent
            - difference in sub-intent & general intent
              - "state of a high-change function (like build) to check important vertex variables (determining solution success like 'function intent') or error types (like 'difference in sub-intent & general intent') multiple times during high-change function application to code (build phase with varying states of function interactions)"

  - apply relevance attribute filters to determine problem/solution component structures (like 'cause of a variable x')
    - exclusivity/specificity
      - could this component be the cause
      - what else also has this attribute/function/component without the cause (what else doesnt have the component but still causes x)
    - intent
      - does this component indicate agency or other direct/clear intent
      - could this component be accidental (not useful or not used) vs. intended (is it useful to some degree for some goal)
    - requirement
      - is this component required or optional
      - could the requirement be the cause
    - expectation
      - what is the expected/standard component
      - could the standard or the distortion from the expected/standard component be the cause
    - commonness/uniqueness
      - is this component common or unique
      - are unique components the cause, if common components don't cause x
    - input/output
      - is this an input or output
      - can the output be the cause, if the goal causes it
      - can the input be the cause, if another input wouldn't cause it
      - can the function be the cause, if any input would cause it
    - system context
      - can the system be configured to not need the component (is the system or system configuration the cause of x)
      - would the component be re-generated if you removed the component or the direct cause of the component
        - would the component be created anyway, even with a minor barrier
        - is the component incentivized in the system
        - how much work would you have to do to prevent the component from being generated in the system (it would be created unconditionally, or in what percent of conditions)
        - does that work change the system to an extreme degree (changing its identity/type/intent)
    - change.structure:
      - opposite: can the component be changed to not cause x
      - symmetry: do changes to the component still cause x
    - potential.structure
      - alternatives: are other structures like combined errors capable of causing x
      - are those structures possible in the system (do they exist in the system)
