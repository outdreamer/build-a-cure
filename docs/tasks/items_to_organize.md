- to do list items

    - example of resolving a conflict between structure/limits using a structural similarity between a structure (gradient of function) & its container/limits (gradient of constraints)
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier
      - also an example of a solution space (the whole function is the solution space of possible minima/maxima) and a filter applied to it (constraint)

    - make a function network of math domains (inputs/outputs of geometry, algebra, calculus that align)

    - resolve definitions of components so you can finish organizing useful structures like combinations of concepts such as "format sequence", "solution automation workflow", "insight path", "reverse-engineer solution from problem requirements or opposite structures", "connect problem & solution"

    - calculating a flow field numerically can be optimized by calculating:
      - possible/probable/fitting components of functions 
        - connections between prior calculations, to find connection structures that re-occur, as the output of a function
          - find core connection structures like waves, peaks, inflection points
        - connections between connection structures, to find: 
          - patterns in connections between:
              - identified patterns of difference, like degree of difference observed between adjacent points
              - structures of approximation & accuracy (what kind of structure could add prediction accuracy, in what contexts)
              - base functions & base function components & useful/stable functions
              - similarities in structures of difference, between function structures like variables & error structures like distortions
            - variables of & distortions to those variables common to connection structures & connections of those structures
          - connection components that coordinate for some intent
            - intents like calculation in an input/output sequence, or fitting into a structure that is efficiently compressed or retrieved
              - incentivized connections that are optimal for some calculation intent
        - generate & test predictions of future calculations, to find local/adjacent prediction functions
          - generate set of prediction functions to test predictions
            - apply operations & structures known to produce common connection structures to calculations in reverse to derive possible function components
          - generate set of prediction function filters (extreme prior connection structures) to select prediction functions
          - generate set of opposite structures (like non-adjacent points) to test predictions
      - filters of functions (reduce solution space of possible function & function components)
        - filtering functions by these connection structures & patterns, filtering out functions that wouldn't adjacently produce these connection structures
      - interaction structures of functions & function components
        - function components that can interact by coordinating, vs function components that invalidate each other & can't coexist absolutely or be adjacent locally/directly
      - function & function component causal structures
        - apply patterns of causation between functions (function of structure A causes function of structure B) to identify the level of cause a function is based at

    - example of how to generate monopoly case arguments
      - change variable 'location of power':
        - spotify is welcome to build their own app store with their own phones or team up with their coalition to do so
        - add variable 'time sequence' to 'location of power' change:
          - if spotify operates an app store someday, they will set rules to benefit themselves too, just like theyve done in the past
        - offer an alternative to charging app store rate
          - is there a one-click button to migrate from spotify to apple that could replace any difference in taxes on spotify
      - apply conceptual definition filter 'does concept of persecution (and related components of the definition like focus) apply to the behavior (does behavior have a specific target that is the focus of persecution)'
        - are apple's rules applied exclusively to spotify? if not, it's not anti-competitive behavior
      - apply intent filter
        - is spotify's mission nobler than apple's
      - apply system cost-benefit analysis
        - what features were improved bc spotify exists? are those features worth anything or required needs? did they develop those features better than competitors?
        - if spotify is just charging rent on a catalog, are they adding value to the market, so they should be allowed to dictate the market at all?
        - what products/features would apple develop if they didnt have to pay a fine, and what are those features worth, and are those features required?
      - apply logical fallacy filters
        - apply 'hypocrisy' filter
          - apply 'anti-competitive' conceptual definition structures & test if these structures fit the opponent
            - does spotify plan on raising prices at some point or will they keep prices low even if the app store rate holds? are they only keeping prices low to dominate the market & plan on raising prices later? isnt that anti-competitive behavior?
            - if they are so concerned about anti-competitive behavior, why arent they trying to compete by building their own app store? isnt there a risk that the apple app store is sub-optimal and needs to be improved with competition from spotify

    - value isnt created/lost by companies in the timespan of hype/short cycles, so stock market price swings aren't reflective of reality from a macro perspective
      - it takes years to build value, it doesn't happen overnight, excluding almost magical insights that create cascading efficiencies like my system
      - losing value also happens slowly, excluding extreme natural disasters, like the value of a community still being relatively high despite shared losses, bc of social network effects & organization/coordination effects
      - value can be calculated differently, using metadata like the lifetime & total possible value of a product
        - what is the total supply of the product inputs (fossil fuels)
        - what is the usability lifetime
        - what are the costs
        - what are the product intent alternatives (can intents fulfilled by the product be fulfilled by other products)
        - what is purchased with revenue from a product (research, insights, other more valuable resellable products, etc)
        - if this pricing method is applied to fossil fuels, oil companies would be paying people to use them

    - identify filters for definition routes

    - database polling/prompting user for update & predicting updates or searching for & receiving user-approved updates from other services, rather than being a passive receiver of input from user
      - based on local usage/change patterns or integrated usage patterns to identify expected transactions with other services
        - once a credit card is marked as lost in a banking service, a change of credit card numbers is expected by other services which can poll for updates to this flag
          - user option like 'yes, allow other approved databases containing my address poll to collect this update'
        - once a renters insurance policy is changed in an insurance service, a change of address might be expected by other services

    - make list of variable structure variables measured by algorithms & why they are measured by a network algorithm

  - make diagram of absolute reference connections with metadata structures like networks/paths
  - determine core graph variables (definition of adjacence/difference, connectivity, dimensions, info storage methods, interactivity of structures like sequences)
  - crypto as community consensus, where a decision can have value if backed by a community

    - examine connection between fractals, sequences, averages, origins, multipliers (self, as in power), & circles
      - fractals as a relevant structure for adding sequences of fractions (adding numbers similar to itself on a smaller scale, infinitely) as a way of producing inputs to circles created by transforming a fractal spiral, where the origin is the original number as a base for applying increasingly smaller scales
      - the set of points forming roots of an infinite negative number sequence (roots of unity, rather than roots of any negative integer number) as a way of producing a circle because of their common distance to their average (center) forming the radius
      - lines of equal length having a common average point (center/origin)
      - fractals & infinite sequences as a way of calculating area under a continuous line (increasing small subsets of structures with area calculatable with multiplication of x & y)
      - what continuous line segments would have an area equal to a circle of relevant proportions?

    - how to identify the killer counterpoint
      - point: 'election fraud claims'
        - counterpoint: you dont think the other party has members?
          - followup points:
            - how are they organizing? why do you even hear about them?
            - who's benefitting from investing massive funding in creating a false illusion, if its all fake?
            - why wouldnt they choose cheaper methods of doing so than an elaborate illusion?
      - identify most extreme false assumption of point by identify causes of the output metric (vote count)
        - the primary/basic false assumption of the point is that the other side doesnt have votes that are comparable in quantity
          - possible causes (inputs) of 'not having similar vote count' include:
            - not going to vote
            - not being able to vote
            - not having members to vote
          - the most extreme false assumption is the most extreme cause of 'not having similar vote count' (that the other side doesnt even have members (input of votes) that are comparable in quantity, let alone votes (output))
      - identify 'incentives', 'side effects of party/member/vote existence & size' as other relevant concepts to generate followup questions

    - the work of 'stealing my work' and 'pretending not to' doesnt produce efficient brains with a good grasp of concepts like 'meaning', so it emerges as an inefficiency bc the type of brains developed wont be good at finding solutions to output problems generated by granularly copying/pasting to a specific problem/solution & hoping it works better
            - 'understanding my work' is a better goal if you cant look away bc youre not done experiencing awe
              - once you understand it, you wont need to watch me work, youll be able to generate my work
  
  - apply nn to derive error types & bias incorporated into other nn data/parameters/algorithms/structures/models    

- examples

      - joke mapping insight paths
        - unlikely hypothetical
          - several degrees of assumption chains to generate an unlikely hypothetical (sequence of assumptions from a starting assumption/premise, generating a background story/context)
            - serious + petty + important: 'none of us can figure out why he tucks in his tie'
              - implies that the problem was so serious that a discussion happened to investigate & research it to fix it
              - implies that no one is allowed to ask him or has the courage to ask him directly, implying he's powerful in some way & cannot be questioned, which implies these are his subordinates who are not doing work in order to discuss this, which implies this could cause their work arrangement to be invalid 
            - 'none of us ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - repeated + important: implies that the discussion was repeated bc it was such an important matter
            - 'none of our lawyers or R&D staff ever figured out why he tucked in his tie'
              - important: adds another level of importance in that they hired an expensive legal team to investigate the matter for liability/indemnity/litigation potential as if it made the company look so bad they had to hire a legal team
            - "the tie-tucking survived ex-girlfriends' interventions"
              - important: it has ruined multiple relationships with people who cared about him who tried to stop him from doing this to himself
              - briefer than previous version & uses more evocative verb
              - different: 
                - add assumption: assumption that the audience is rooting for the tie-tucking to continue
                - add concept of 'agency': attributing personhood to the tie-tucking, which is fighting for its life against cruel monsters
            - 'even after being accused of being a double-tucker who tucks his tie but not his shirt, he persisted'
              - important + petty + similar: fashion is a petty thing to care about this much, and a special jargon term 'double-tucker' implies a whole community or sub-culture based on or caring about this issue or related issues, which he has caused controversy in, with added importance by association from term 'double-agent', typically reserved for high-stakes situations like foreign wars, as if he's betraying someone or his heritage or group or people who rooted for him, and rhymes with a curse word
            - 'the mysterious tie-tucker left the board of directors' 
              - important + reduced: condensing the entire story into a brief structure like a nickname and casually referencing it despite the importance implied in a problem that generates a nickname
        - topics
          - conspiracy theory (a muffling device to prevent the Chinese from listening to his balls chafe for blackmail material)
          - cults/ex's (definitely worshiping the wrong things)
        - total opposite: 'your fatal flaw wasn't so much all the excessive drunk online shopping purchases at the police store & the corporate sabotage so much as the curtains from korea that spied on us & posted our arguments to porn sites' (it was absolutely the excessive spending at the police store)
        - changing definitions to very different alternate definition
          - 'tucked in his tie' or 'used unnecessary protection' or 'packed heat'
        - resolving awkwardness
          - 'i dont hate your dick pics (introduces the problem, 'uh oh does she hate my dick pics'), I just think theyre (foreshadowing something that seems like a difference but is actually similar) more optimal when directed at enthusiasts (or professionals), such as doctors/researchers, who might appreciate it more than I ever could (optional: from a curiousity perspective)'
        - mixed contexts/styles
          - talking about an unimportant matter in the same terms used for important matters
            - 'his parents couldnt deal with the idea of confrontation so they gently let him lose touch rather than disowning him outright' 
        - adding relevant structures of meaning like:
          - aligning layers like double entendres
            - calling him a 'magician' bc they have a function of 'hiding scarves' which is similar to 'tucking a tie' bc 'tucking' has a related output of 'hiding'
        - defeating the purpose/self-defeating
          - listing all the manipulations youre using, while using them, to the target 
        - false dignity/over-generousity
          - calling him a 'international man of mystery' bc its a very dignified way to portray having mysterious fashion habits that defy analysis from subject matter experts
          - 'he must be doing it to scare away women bc theyre always chasing him'
        - injecting stupidity/extremes
          - he thought it would act like a talisman to protect him from rape or unwanted pregnancy
          - he was told by a foreign holy man (has association with 'wise foreigner' stereotype) that it would protect him from fertility like a 'cosmic condom' (repetition, catchy) 
        - removing a point/agency (its not an intent, he just had the clingiest underwear/reproductive organs known to mankind)
        - fitting with existing systems without obvious contradictions
          - 'using existing phrases in a new way with minimal distortions' is surprising bc its unlikely to find a new distortion of an existing component that someone hasnt tried, so the simpler the better for this type


  - ml explanation of finding coefficients of prediction function by applying distortions to coefficients & ruling out distortions that dont contribute to prediction accuracy
    - can be optimized with reductions like:
      - 'calculating the most different distortions that will reduce possible values the quickest & applying those distortions'
    - proof/determination structures
      - what makes something possible to determine/calculate
        - a solution structure where the solution metric is clearly defined (structural or having other structures of certainty like consistency or inevitability or requirement)
          - checking a path to see if it includes a node twice is clearly defined (it uses the structure of 'node visit counts' in the 'path' solution structure)
      - what makes something difficult to prove
        - where there are ambiguities (lack of certainty/structure/definition) between the input parameters & the output function value
          - ambiguities such as where multiple inputs produce the same output, like how different x-values can produce the same y value on a wave function
      - useful proof structures
        - apply possible components to create an absolute or scalable definition include components framed in terms of interactions with other components that can be used with a consistent measurement (like a stable structure across interfaces or dimension sets) & can also scale (boundaries), rather than framing them in terms that can have different meanings at different parameters (closed, hollow)

    - add to causation variables
      - ability to change (if a variable cant be changed, it is less causative for problem-solving intents)

    - give examples of identifying vertex variables
      - general vertex variables: topic, origin/destination, reason/cause/point/intent, errors, variables, types
      - comedy vertex variables: sincerity, stupidity, stakes, tension-resolution/expectation-subverting pattern variation
      - music vertex variables: tone, tension-resolution/expectation-subverting pattern variation, lyrics
      - optimization metric vertex variables: solution metric patterns (what other solutions optimize for, to determine optimization metrics to apply)

    - when is it optimal to store a mixed structure of varying specificity (like a type, intent, cause & a specific example)
      - when there are potential uncertainties to resolve, like whether the example represents a new error, type, or variable, bc the example doesnt fit known structures

    - all primary interfaces can act like the problem-solving interface (start solving problem from the concept or structure interface and integrate all info back into that interface & frame the solution in terms of that interface) but the meaning interface (the interface interface) is the most powerful

  - visualizing higher dimensions with changes in a network of visualizable variable subsets like:

    - dimension subsets: displaying dimension subsets in groups of sizes that are already visualizable (from 1 - 4 dimensions), where orthogonality is preserved across the network of subsets
    - dimension groups: grouping similar dimensional changes into a change type across a dimension subset, to visualize the change types
    
    - relevant (robust) dimensions
      - dimension invalidations: grouping invalidating/neutralizing change types
      - causative dimensions: just visualizing higher-impact/causal dimensions
      - vertex dimensions: graphing variables as differences from vertex variables
    
    - mapping dimensions: group value sets as other structures like points or networks in a space where change types like 'continuous change' are supported
      - embedded dimensions: dimensions graphed visually using extra dimensions as parameters
      - base dimensions: dimensions standardized to a base and graphed in alignment, like multiple functions on a graph with a common base
      - mapping other dimension metadata: interactions between dimensions units/change types/limits/definitions are graphed
      - abstract dimensions: abstract value structures are graphed ('a point on a line') instead of specific values in a dimension
      - constant dimensions: adjacent limiting constant dimensions are graphed instead of dimensions of change

    - dimension interactions: 
      - interactive dimensions: dimensions that interact are condensed into an input/output of the interaction structure, and input/output dimensions are graphed instead
      - dimension interaction structures: structures of interactions between variables (like direction/circuits/networks) are preserved, where values may be lost
        - dimensional difference: difference between dimensions is graphed instead of different dimensions & values, where dimension values are structures associated with graphed dimension interactions
        - conversion requirements: conversion requirements to a visualizable shape are graphed instead of actual dimensions/values
        - interaction structures between value structures like positions on dimensions when graphed as a standardized shape
          - example: with dimensions formatted as a standardized form like 'lines of equal length, & values as points on these lines', the interaction structure would be the lines connecting the points on the dimension lines, when arranged in any order
