original proof:

x = 0.999 (continuing digits to infinity)
10x = 9.999
10x - x = 9.999 - .999
9x = 9
x = 1

frame both sides with coefficients

1 * x = 0.999 * 1
10 * x = 9.999 * 1
(10 - 1) * x = (9.999 - .999) * 1
9 * x = 9 * 1
x = 1

frame both sides with variable a as coefficient in place of 1

1 * x = 0.999 * a
10 * x = 9.999 * a
(10 - 1) * x = (9.999 - .999) * a
9 * x = 9 * a
x = a

frame both sides with equivalent integer coefficients

1 * x = 0.999 * a
(1 * 10) * x = (.999 * 10) * a
(1 * 10 - (1 * 10)/10) * x = (.999 * 10 - (0.999 * 10)/10) * a
9 * x = 9 * a
x = a

standardize both sides to language

coefficient * x = adjacent_coefficient * a
(coefficient * number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction) * x = (adjacent_coefficient * number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction) * a
(coefficient * (number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction - the fraction of itself based on this number, to give other side an integer)) * x = (adjacent_coefficient * (number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction  - the fraction of itself based on this number)) * a
integer produced by integerizing number (* 10) and subtracted fraction (/10) * x = integer produced by integerizing number (adjacent_coefficient * 10) and subtracted fraction (9 + adjacent_coefficient)/10 * a
x = a

problem to solution intent:

	- alternative intent using insight path
		- find a number b (9.999) so that 1/n of itself is equal to the original adjacent_coefficient (0.999) so an adjacent integer (9) divisible by the repeating digit (9) to produce an integer (1) (after moving one decimal to produce the integer) can be achieved by subtracting the adjacent_coefficient, given that 1/n of b will be the decimal after the integer, where n is a coefficient of the other side of the equation indicating only a multiplication operation has been done (requiring that no change has been done to the number type of the other side, as multiplying 1 by an integer = an integer)
			- b * 1/n = adjacent_coefficient = (b - adjacent_coefficient) * 1/n * (infinite sequence of 1/(10 ^ 0), 1/(10 ^ 1), 1/(10 ^ 2) ...)
			- 9.999 * 1/10 = 0.999 = (9.999 - 0.999) * 1/10 * (infinite sequence)

	- frame with infinite sequence as coefficients
		0.999 = 9 * [1/(10 ^ 1) + 1/(10 ^ 2) + 1/(10 ^ 3) ...]
		0.999 * 10 = 9 * [1/(10 ^ 0) + 1/(10 ^ 1) + 1/(10 ^ 2) ...] = 
				   = 9 * 1/(10 ^ 0) + [1/(10 ^ 1) + 1/(10 ^ 2) + 1/(10 ^ 3) ...]
				   = 9 + [1/(10 ^ 1) + 1/(10 ^ 2) + 1/(10 ^ 3) ...]
	    9.999      = 9 + [1/(10 ^ 1) + 1/(10 ^ 2) + 1/(10 ^ 3) ...]
	    0.999      = [1/(10 ^ 1) + 1/(10 ^ 2) + 1/(10 ^ 3) ...]

	- other insights
		- equalize 0.999 and 1
			- comparison intent
				- standardize (reduce difference)
					- base
						- each repeating digit is an element with the same numerator coefficient in an infinite sequence of formula 9/(10^n), so 10 is a relevant number by default
					- coefficients
						- of infinite series: the repetition of the numerator indicates a value that can be extracted as a coefficient of the series, so the numerator can be standardized to 1
						- for coefficient value difference reduction intent, for comparison intent
					- number types for value difference reduction intent, for comparison intent
						- dont use division to change values, unless the output is an integer to keep values in integer number type (as target value to achieve from source value 0.999 is an integer, 1)
				- isolate variables on either side (after optionally framing 1 as variable a)
			- connect comparable values once standardized
				- find adjacent operations producing target number type or value
					- producing an integer 9 on the x side is adjacent with multiplication, and doesnt involve a number type change to the other side with either multiplication or subtraction, just a scalar change, which keeps it as an integer
					- producing an integer 9 on the x side is adjacent with multiplication & subtraction, and does involve a number type change at the subtraction operation
				- filter adjacent operations by restrictions
					- dont use division or operations that change to a decimal rather than an integer

	intent: show that 0.999 and 1 are equal
		sub-intent: equalize coefficient of x and coefficient of 1 (a)
			sub-intent: equalize one side with integer (9)
				sub-intent: show coefficients of both sides
				sub-intent: find coefficient (10) that will equalize the side with repeating digits to an integer + original quantity with repeating digit (0.999)
					- this has to be a number (10) that will produce an integer (9) from the fraction 0.999, after a subtraction of itself (- 0.999), by moving the decimal one place
				sub-intent: equalize both sides to an integer (subtract 0.999)
					sub-intent: find x value in remaining formula (9x = 9)
