original proof:

x = 0.999 (continuing digits to infinity)
10x = 9.999
10x - x = 9.999 - .999
9x = 9
x = 1

frame both sides with coefficients

1 * x = 0.999 * 1
10 * x = 9.999 * 1
(10 - 1) * x = (9.999 - .999) * 1
9 * x = 9 * 1
x = 1

frame both sides with variable a as coefficient in place of 1

1 * x = 0.999 * a
10 * x = 9.999 * a
(10 - 1) * x = (9.999 - .999) * a
9 * x = 9 * a
x = a

frame both sides with equivalent integer coefficients

1 * x = 0.999 * a
(1 * 10) * x = (.999 * 10) * a
(1 * 10 - (1 * 10)/10) * x = (.999 * 10 - (0.999 * 10)/10) * a
9 * x = 9 * a
x = a

standardize both sides to language

coefficient * x = adjacent_coefficient * a
(coefficient * number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction) * x = (adjacent_coefficient * number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction) * a
(coefficient * (number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction - the fraction of itself based on this number, to give other side an integer)) * x = (adjacent_coefficient * (number giving other side an integer accessible with a fraction subtraction  - the fraction of itself based on this number)) * a
integer produced by integerizing number (* 10) and subtracted fraction (/10) * x = integer produced by integerizing number (adjacent_coefficient * 10) and subtracted fraction (9 + adjacent_coefficient)/10 * a
x = a

problem to solution intent:

	- alternative intent using insight path
		- find a number b (9.999) so that 1/n of itself is equal to the original adjacent_coefficient (0.999) so an integer (9) divisible by the repeating digit (9) to produce an integer (1) (after moving one decimal to produce the integer) can be achieved by subtracting the adjacent_coefficient, given that 1/n of itself will be the decimal after the integer, where n is a coefficient of the other side of the equation indicating only a multiplication operation has been done (requiring that no change has been done to the number type of the other side, as multiplying 1 by an integer = an integer)
			- b * 1/n = adjacent_coefficient = (b - adjacent_coefficient) * 1/n * (infinite sequence of 1/(10 ^ 0), 1/(10 ^ 1), 1/(10 ^ 2) ...)
			- 9.999 * 1/10 = 0.999 = (9.999 - 0.999) * 1/10

	- other insights
		- each repeating digit is 9/10, so 10 is a relevant number by default
		- standardize number types for value difference reduction for comparison
		- standardize coefficients for coefficient value difference reduction for comparison
		- isolate variables on either side (after framing 1 as variable a)
		- producing an integer 9 on the x side is adjacent with multiplication, and doesnt involve a number type change to the other side with either multiplication or subtraction, just a scalar change, which keeps it as an integer
		- producing an integer 9 on the x side is adjacent with multiplication & subtraction, and does involve a number type change at the subtraction operation

	intent: show that 0.999 and 1 are equal
		sub-intent: equalize coefficient of x and coefficient of 1 (a)
			sub-intent: equalize one side with integer (9)
				sub-intent: show coefficients of both sides
				sub-intent: find coefficient (10) that will equalize the side with repeating digits to an integer + original quantity with repeating digit (0.999)
					- this has to be a number (10) that will produce an integer (9) from the fraction 0.999, after a subtraction of itself (- 0.999), by moving the decimal one place
				sub-intent: equalize both sides to an integer (subtract 0.999)
					sub-intent: find x value in remaining formula (9x = 9)
