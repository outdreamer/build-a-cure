# Causal interface definition sample

	- interface definition

		- conversion function

			- standardize to the cause object definition
				- default conversion operations:
					- mapping objects that can be converted
					- adding/deriving missing objects required for the interface
					- removing irrelevant objects

				- conversion operations that apply other interfaces on top of the causal interface
					- structure-function interface: linking inputs & outputs for causal functions that have structure (sequential functions, hub functions, etc)
					- concept interface: identify dependency, state, adaptability, & agency
					- structure-type interface combination:
						- identifying causal types, such as ambiguous cause, structured as multiple alternate similar routes or multiple unenforced rules/variance injection points

			- the conversion function can be formatted with many different formats (like filters/limits/routes/combinations) to achieve conversion intents (like add/derive/change/remove attributes, or apply metrics)					
			- the intent of the conversion function is to represent each component in the problem space (or data set) as a component of cause (attribute, structure, concept, related object, etc)
			- the conversion function will attempt to standardize to related interfaces, if the minimum information for the current interface is not met
				- adjacent causal interfaces (interfaces acting as inputs/outputs or with similarities to this interface, like how information, math, and structure are related interfaces)
				- alternate/proxy causal interfaces (interface combinations/embeddings that can act in place of this interface)

			- a structure with a causation attribute (standardizable to the causal interfacee) can have:
				- causal attributes (causal inputs/outputs, function variables, causal metrics, and descriptive attributes like direction, ambiguity, relevance, uniqueness, directness, inevitability)
				- causal types (root, direct, hub)
				- causal functions (converge/diverge, catalyze, depend, isolate)
				- causal structures (vector, tree, loop, network)
				- related objects (related concepts like dependence, ambiguity, relevance, agency)

			- you can look for cause in structures by prioritizing:
				- known causal structures & causal patterns
				- causal vertex variables (like dependence)
				- variables that are often found with cause
					- combinations of identifying objects/attributes/functions, like ambiguous-direction or inevitable-unique structures
					- causal function inputs/outputs
					- related objects to cause
					- preceding/determining/generative structures of these components (generative structures of related objects, causal function outputs, inevitable-unique structures)
		
	- cause converted to the object interface

			- attributes

				- identification/description variables

					- direction
						- describes direction of control between nodes

					- ambiguity
						- occurs with multiple alternates that are not clearly different in their input/output

					- directness
						- adjacency of cause

					- uniqueness
						- describing whether multiple causes can be ruled out

					- inevitability
						- pre-determination of cause, which occurs from structure

					- relevance

				- types (apply attributes with varying values to generate core types)
					- root cause: an origin cause of a causal branch
					- catalyst: triggers cascade of causes
					- hub: a causal node where causes aggregate, are generated, or connect (like a structural or information cause)
					- indirect/inevitable/ambiguous/unique cause
					- relevant cause: cause on similar interaction layer or in similar position as:
						- agents ('describe the problem' has relevant causes like direct cause)
						- agent intents ('intent to invalidate the problem' has different relevant causes, like the root cause)
					- alternate cause
					- interface causes
						- structural cause
							- cause from position
							- cause from interaction layer
						- concept cause
							- balance/power as a cause (balance/power attributes/functions caused the output)
					- causation bases
						- decision-based cause (from an agent)
						- time-based cause (the cause is the default/natural progression from a prior state)
						- random cause (from lack of agents or organization)
				- inputs
					- interaction
					- adjacence
					- similarity
					- cooperativeness
					- potential
					- structure
					- change
				- outputs
					- determination
					- influence
				- description attributes
					- causal structure
					- causal type
					- cause-generation potential
					- randomness
				- generative attributes
					- system context
						- change rules
						- object identities
						- interaction iterations
				- metric attributes
					- number of steps between causal nodes (measures directness of cause)
					- number of possible causes (measures uniqueness/ambiguity of cause)
				- function parameters

			- function interface
				- patterns
				- functions
					- core functions
						- inherits structural core functions (combine, merge, rotate, convert, format, limit, enforce)
					- change functions
						- change structure
						- change intent
						- change cause metrics
						- change cause attributes or attribute values
						- change causal direction
						- dis/ambiguate (clarify) cause
						- distance/connect cause
						- apply/inject cause
						- intend cause (use a cause to fulfill an intent)
						- require/invalidate cause
						- assume cause
						- depend/isolate
						- converge/diverge

					- boundary functions
						- cause is not:
							- lack of a resource that couldnt be expected (divine intervention, meaning/reasons/incentives, connection across distant systems)

					- condition/context functions

						- cause of the same event can have different structure across contexts, such as:
							- being poisoned by a plant while lost on a hike (evolution, randomness, lack of information, low agency injection) has a different cause than taking the substance for a research experiment (high level of agency injection), and this will impact the causal structures activated by that substance (being eaten by bears, receiving antidote)

						- conditional cause functions assess the conditions/context of a cause, to determine contextual (system-fitted) cause
							- accidentally taking luggage on a plane that someone planted drugs in often has a different cause than agreeing to do it
								- unless the only reason they accidentally didnt check their luggage was fear of gangs, and if the agreement would also occur bc of fear of gangs

						- functions include:
							- determine causal position relative to other causes (like context or system structure)
							- determine range of possible structures of a cause, with other conditions/contexts applied
							- apply context/condition to a cause

					- connecting functions
						- combination functions
							- these functions determine how causes of different attributes/types/change states interact, answering questions like:
								- how does an agent cause combine with a structural cause?

				- related objects

					- information interface
						- definitions
							- cause: input, power, excess unhandled energy, lack of organization
						- strategies
							- 'abstract rules create causal ambiguity the best'
						- insights
							- 'causation is a relative term'
						- questions
							- 'which causal relationships should be checked first when finding variable relationships?'
						- context
							- system context
							- problem space context
							- dimension set context
								- spaces where cause is measurable (dimensions maximizing or displaying differences)

					- intent interface
						- causal intents
							- outputs (direct/combined/emerging)
							- side effects (indirect side effects of outputs, processing side effects like locking inputs, opportunity cost of processing)
						- intent vs. incentives: an intent without an agency cause is an incentive
							- incentives are usually considered less causal than intents, from the agent perspective: 
							- agents cant be expected to go against incentives every time, as theyre generated by system structure
							- but agents can usually inject agency into the system, to change its structure & the intents resulting from it
							- intents exist outside of the system, which can motivate agents to change a system
							- so structure of a system is not the cause of all causes, but it is an important interface to apply on top of the causal interface
							- if there is an absolute root cause, it may be change rules (how systems change)

					- concept interface
						- core causal concepts
							- state: important for identifying sequential causation
							- structure: important for identifying inevitable causation
							- agency: injection of intent into structure (like with organization)
							- adaptation: important for identifying causal potential (an organism that can learn/change is likelier to be causal)
							- dependence (structure: causal links)
								- mutual dependence (structure: causal loop)
							- ambiguity vs. determination/uniqueness (reducing possible alternatives)
						- determining concepts
						- adjacent concepts

					- type interface
						- attribute sets differentiating objects
						- attribute sets without types
						- type hierarchy

					- system interface
						- causal system
							- system objects
								- symmetries/efficiencies/similarities
								- definitions (difference, power, direction)
							- system functions
								- core system function (apply, inject, combine) definitions on the causal interface

					- structural interface
						- structures
							- structure network (links between causal & other structures)
							- causal structures
								- causal structure network (links between causal structures like sequence, hierarchy, tree, network, etc)
									- structures (filters, limits, maps, networks, trades, sequences, links, circuits)
							- determining structures
								- input/determining structures
									- filters
									- functions
							- structures identifying cause
								- tree origin (root cause)
								- adjacence (causal degree)
								- layer (alternative cause on layer)

					- combined/applied/injected interfaces

								- intents identifying cause
									- aligned intents (compounding cause)

							- pattern-structure interface
								- 'a causal tree often has multiple layers & may converge to fewer nodes'
