# Causal interface definition sample


	- interface definition

		- cause object definition

			- attributes

				- direction
					- describes direction of control between nodes
				- ambiguity
					- occurs with multiple alternates that are not clearly different in their input/output
				- directness
					- adjacency of cause
				- uniqueness
					- describing whether multiple causes can be ruled out
				- inevitability
					- pre-determination of cause, which occurs from structure

				- types (apply attributes with varying values to generate core types)
					- root cause: an origin cause of a causal branch
					- catalyst: triggers cascade of causes
					- hub: a causal node where causes aggregate, are generated, or connect (like a structural or information cause)
					- indirect/inevitable/ambiguous/unique cause
					- relevant cause: cause on similar interaction layer or in similar position as:
						- agents ('describe the problem' has relevant causes like direct cause)
						- agent intents ('intent to invalidate the problem' has different relevant causes, like the root cause)
					- alternate cause
					- interface causes
						- structural cause
							- cause from position
							- cause from interaction layer
						- concept cause
							- balance/power as a cause (balance/power attributes/functions caused the output)
					- causation bases
						- decision-based cause (from an agent)
						- time-based cause (the cause is the default/natural progression from a prior state)
						- random cause (from lack of agents or organization)

			- functions

				- function types

					- core functions
						- inherits structural core functions (combine, merge, rotate, convert, format)

					- change functions
						- change structure
						- change intent
						- change cause metrics
						- change cause attributes or attribute values
						- change causal direction
						- dis/ambiguate (clarify) cause
						- distance/connect cause
						- apply/inject cause
						- intend cause (use a cause to fulfill an intent)
						- require/invalidate cause
						- assume cause

					- boundary functions

						- cause is not:
							- lack of a resource that couldnt be expected (divine intervention, meaning/reasons/incentives, connection across distant systems)

					- condition/context functions

						- cause of the same event can have different structure across contexts, such as:
							- being poisoned by a plant while lost on a hike (evolution, randomness, lack of information, low agency injection) has a different cause than taking the substance for a research experiment (high level of agency injection), and this will impact the causal structures activated by that substance (being eaten by bears, receiving antidote)

						- conditional cause functions assess the conditions/context of a cause, to determine contextual (system-fitted) cause
							- accidentally taking luggage on a plane that someone planted drugs in often has a different cause than agreeing to do it
								- unless the only reason they accidentally didnt check their luggage was fear of gangs, and if the agreement would also occur bc of fear of gangs

						- functions include:
							- determine causal position relative to other causes (like context or system structure)
							- determine range of possible structures of a cause, with other conditions/contexts applied
							- apply context/condition to a cause

					- connecting functions

						- combination functions
							- these functions determine how causes of different attributes/types/change states interact, answering questions like:
								- how does an agent cause combine with a structural cause?

			- related objects

				- intent
					- incentives are usually considered less causal than intents, from the agent perspective: 
						- agents cant be expected to go against incentives every time, as theyre generated by system structure
						- but agents can usually inject agency into the system, to change its structure & the intents resulting from it
						- intents exist outside of the system, which can motivate agents to change a system
						- so structure of a system is not the cause of all causes, but it is an important interface to apply on top of the causal interface
						- if there is an absolute root cause, it may be change rules (how systems change)

				- concepts
					- state: important for identifying sequential causation
					- structure: important for identifying inevitable causation
					- agency: injection of intent into structure (like with organization)
					- adaptation: important for identifying causal potential (an organism that can learn/change is likelier to be causal)

		- conversion function

			- standardize to the cause object definition

			- a structure (combination & sequence) applied to filters (to remove attributes or apply metrics), other distortion functions (to enhance or operate on attributes), & limits (to reduce attributes)

				- given the definition of cause, converting a system to the causal interface would include logic like linking inputs & outputs on function sequences, standardizing to dependency relationships, and identifying areas of ambiguous cause explaining a pattern

			- represents each object in problem space (or unconverted query) as a component, attribute, structure, related object, etc of cause

		- related interfaces

			- adjacent interfaces (interfaces acting as inputs/outputs or with similarities to this interface, like how information, math, and structure are related interfaces)

			- proxy interfaces (interface combinations/embeddings that can act in place of this interface)

	- interface implementations
