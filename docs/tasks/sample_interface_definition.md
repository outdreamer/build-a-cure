# causal interface definition sample


	- interface definition

		- cause object definition

		- conversion function

			- standardize to the cause object definition

			- a structure (combination & sequence) applied to filters (to remove attributes or apply metrics), other distortion functions (to enhance or operate on attributes), & limits (to reduce attributes)

				- given the definition of cause, converting a system to the causal interface would include logic like linking inputs & outputs on function sequences, standardizing to dependency relationships, and identifying areas of ambiguous cause explaining a pattern

			- represents each object in problem space (or unconverted query) as a component, attribute, structure, related object, etc of cause

		- related interfaces

			- adjacent interfaces (interfaces acting as inputs/outputs or with similarities to this interface, like how information, math, and structure are related interfaces)

			- proxy interfaces (interface combinations/embeddings that can act in place of this interface)

	- interface implementations

	- system interface

		- causal system

			- system objects

				- symmetries
				- efficiencies
				- similarities
				- definitions (difference, power, direction)

			- system functions

				- core system function (apply, inject, combine) definitions on the causal interface

		- object interface

			- cause components

			- attributes

				- inputs
					- interaction
					- adjacence
					- similarity
					- cooperativeness
					- potential
					- structure
					- change

				- outputs
					- determination
					- influence

				- description attributes
					- causal structure
					- causal type
					- cause-generation potential
					- randomness

				- generative attributes

					- system context
						- change rules
						- object identities
						- interaction iterations

				- metric attributes
					- number of steps between causal nodes (measures directness of cause)
					- number of possible causes (measures uniqueness/ambiguity of cause)

				- function parameters


			- function interface

				- patterns

				- functions

					- core functions

						- depend/isolate
						- converge/diverge
						- interact
							- combine/merge/collide

					- structure functions

						- limits
							- enforcement
						- interactions

				- relationships

					- related objects

						- information interface

							- definitions

								- cause:
									- 'input'
									- 'power'
									- 'excess unhandled energy'

							- strategies

								- 'abstract rules create causal ambiguity the best'

							- insights

								- 'causation is a relative term'

							- questions

								- 'which causal relationships should be checked first when finding variable relationships?'

							- context

								- system context

								- problem space context

								- dimension set context
									- spaces where cause is measurable (dimensions maximizing or displaying differences)


			- type interface

				- types

					- attribute sets differentiating objects

					- attribute sets without types

					- type hierarchy


	- intent interface

		- causal intents

			- outputs (direct/combined/emerging)
			- side effects (indirect side effects of outputs, processing side effects like locking inputs, opportunity cost of processing)


	- concept interface

		- core causal concepts

			- causal links

				- dependence
				- mutual dependence (causal loop)

			- direct vs. indirect cause

			- ambiguity vs. determination (reducing possible alternatives)

		- determining concepts

		- adjacent concepts


	- structural interface

		- structures

			- structure network (links between causal & other structures)

			- causal structures

				- causal structure network (links between causal structures like sequence, hierarchy, tree, network, etc)

					- structures (filters, limits, maps, networks, trades, sequences, links, circuits)

			- determining structures

				- input/determining structures
					- filters
					- functions

			- structures identifying cause

				- tree origin (root cause)
				- adjacence (causal degree)
				- layer (alternative cause on layer)
				

	- combined/applied/injected interfaces

			- intent-structure interface

				- intents identifying cause

					- aligned intents (compounding cause)


			- pattern-structure interface

				- 'a causal tree often has multiple layers & may converge to fewer nodes' 


			- structure-function interface

				- functions as structures (filters, limits, maps, networks, trades, sequences, links, circuits)

				- structure functions (traverse, combine, find, build)


			- cause-concept-system interface

				- causal concept system

					- system objects

						- symmetries
						- efficiencies
						- similarities
						- definitions
						- structures (networks, trades, sequences, links, circuits)

					- system functions

						- core system function (apply, inject, combine) definitions on the causal-concept interface
