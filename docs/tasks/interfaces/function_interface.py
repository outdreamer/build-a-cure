'''
- example of the analysis for this interface: 
  - the function interface can include patterns, logic, strategies, rules, and any other set of operations/objects that has order 
  - a function can be any of the following general types: 
    - rule: a static function 
    - function: rule tree, composed of: 
      - conditions (if/for/while/validation/organization) 
      - assignments/relationships (equate an attribute with a value) 
      - processes (an altering process like format, a routing process like return, etc) 
    - intent: purpose for a function (at granular layers or in strict environments, purpose can be tightly aligned with the function logic, with no side effects) 
    - role: function & a position in a system 
    - pattern: sequence or other relationship structure of specific/identified objects (like a sequence of rules, filters, or values) 
    - connection: causal relationship (some type of interaction occurs) 
    - insight: important/relevant/new/unique/abstract/cross-system relationship 
    - strategy: insight & a plan intent on how to implement it, usually to achieve a specific goal intent 
    - this interface extends the core function definition of the object format, which refers to any logical rule, and applies a comprehensive definition that can standardize & describe the function potential of other objects 
- attributes (state, complexity, context, environment, optimization/automation/alternative potential, function type (core/boundary/abstract/change/potential) 
  - alignment: enforced/optional, core, required, emergent/output (built from core functions, with or without associated intent) 
  - interaction: cooperative/conflicting 
  - intent: generative, filtering, grouping, organization/delegation/ distribution/matching/grouping/filtering, classification, differentiation/ transformation 
  - scope: use case, context, range, host system 
  - related objects (like host spaces/systems & object positions in those) 
- functions: 
  - interface-specific functions (find logical fallacy, organize, solve a problem, derive an intent, find dependencies, inject variance, maximize potential, conceptualize) 
  - automation functions 
  - math functions 
  - interaction functions 
- objects (errors, assumptions, side effects, input/output parameters, parameter types, definitions of concepts like equivalence specific to a function) 
- structures 
  - formats (core functions, filters, sequences, limits, network/tree representation, probabilities, attributes) 
- concepts (contextual fit: a function is not completely defined without usage contexts) 
- answers questions like: 
  - are there multiple directions to approach function derivation from? 
        - can patterns in metadata-generators (difference generators) be used to derive the function generators (core functions)? 
        - does it loop around to the start, just like lowest math/structural interface (symmetry, equivalence) loops around to highest conceptual interface (balance, power, random)? 
        - the shape of the interface nexus should be a circuit feeding itself  
          (fractal inputs to itself, where input interfaces are similar in that they can both generate & be generated by the current interface) 
        - this means you can select an optimal interface to start from & a direction to navigate in on the standard order of interface traversal, and an optional interface-organizing metric (like difference) to order interfaces to traverse 
  - how to evaluate change with respect to function/intent or other function metadata: 
    - as change increases, does functionality/intent change and in what direction?
