- apply interaction structures to:

	- problem-solving intents
		- filter solution space
		- reduce problem
		- solve different problem
		- change standard solution
		- check if solution metric is fulfilled

	- common functions
		- find input/output sequence

	- general info existence functions
		- find
			- filter
				- fit
			- identify
		- derive
			- connect
		- generate
			- combine
		- apply/create
			- merge

	- core interaction functions
		- connect
		- reduce
		- combine

	- solution automation workflows
		- trial & error
		- break problem into sub-problems & merge sub-solutions

	- useful structures
		- symmetries
		- ambiguities
		- requirements
		- efficiencies
		- intersections
		- solutions/errors & other primary interface structures (causes, intents)
		- concepts
			- power/balance as useful concepts, indicating usefulness when translated to other interfaces
		- inevitabilities
		- differences/opposites/change types
		- similarities/alignments
		- input/output sequences
		- vertex variables
		- definitions
		- certainty
			- reliability, consistency, stability
			- patterns
			- probabilities

	- important attributes 
		- solution success/failure cause
		- solution/error requirements/defaults/inputs

	- interaction structures
		- functions
		- interactions not designed with intent, as a function
			- errors
			- randomness (random collisions, coincidences)

	- solution automation workflow variables
		- related object network position (workflow fit)
		- generative structures
			- function to generate the workflow
			- solution success/failure cause
		- alternate variations of the workflow
			- generalization
			- simplification

    - interaction levels
    	- interface
    		- primary interfaces (function interaction level, variable interaction level
    		- specific attributes/structures on interfaces
    			- input/output interaction level
    			- time interaction level
    	- abstraction-specification mix
    		- cross-interface mix of some specific structures & some abstract structures
    	- attribute mix
    		- mix of consistency, randomness, balance, etc
    	- interface structure mix
    		- mix of priority, problem, type, structures, intents, etc
