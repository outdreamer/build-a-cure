- to do:

	- identify useful intents of structural interactions and apply:
		
		- optimization/usefulness structures to components (data, learning function, input/output connection)
			- apply 'input-output sequence' structures to any structures that can or should be connected
		
		- interaction structures (combinations, sequences, networks) to all the variables
			- apply interface structures to interface structures
				- core cause structures

	- complete basic config lists

		- complete function lists
			- core interaction functions

		- complete attribute lists
			- solution/problem attributes/variables
			
		- complete structure lists
			- usefulness/organization/meaning/certainty/error/solution/optimization structures, etc
			- useful structures


- variables & configuration

	- fit of variables

		- functions

			- in between the general functions (find/generate/apply/mean) and the core interaction functions (connect, reduce, break, filter), there is an interim level of function interactions that sync with the interface query interaction level (identify, select, cause, standardize, organize, integrate)
				
				- general problem-solving intents for solving info problems
					- the general functions represent general intents fulfilling the structure 'information existence' (in order for info to exist from the perspective of the program, you have to find/derive/generate it)
				
				- specific problem-solving intent functions
					- functions like 'filter solution space' are interactions between structural core interaction functions and problem/solution structures
				
				- the interim functions connect the general & core interaction functions
					- 'organize' is the connecting function between the general function 'mean' and the structural function 'position'
					- 'integrate' is the connecting function between the general function 'mean' and the structural function 'merge'
				
				- structural interaction functions
					- the core interaction functions fulfill common structural intents, not just common to problem/solution interactions but common in general
				
				- solution automation workflow functions
					- solution automation workflows are interaction structures of specific problem-solving intent functions
						- a workflow may fulfill the general problem-solving intent function 'filter solution space'
				
				- interface query functions
					- interface queries are interaction structures of interaction structures to fulfill a function intent (interim functinos, general problem-solving intents, solution automation workflow intents, core interaction functions, etc)
						- 'apply the "structure interface" to fulfill the "connect" core interaction function of the solution automation workflow "connect problem/solution structures"'
						- this calls the 'build' function (to create a 'connection' structure), which is fulfilled by calling the 'apply function' on an 'interface' structure
						- this is an 'embedded' interaction structure, where one interaction structure (apply) is embedded in another (build)
					- interface queries are an 'interaction structure of interaction structures' because they connect solution automation workflows with structural core interaction functions 
						- interface queries are a 'structural implementation' of a solution automation workflow

			- all functions use the general functions ('find') or a sub-function of them on some interaction level, whether its an interim level between general/structure functions ('select'/'compare') or structural level ('filter')

	- solution automation workflow variables

		- useful structures applied to solution automation workflows

			- related object network position (workflow fit)
			
			- generative structures
				- function to generate the workflow
				- solution success/failure cause

			- vertex variables
				- interface queries implementing the workflow
					- interface queries act as a 'problem-solving function' or a 'solution finding/building/deriving function'
					- example: many queries can implement the 'trial & error' workflow, bc some implementations will try certain combinations before other implementations, even when using the same combination-generating function in the same language there may still be variation in the implementation
				- interface structures applied
				- core problem-solution interaction functions (reduce, connect)
				- general functions applied (find, apply, build, derive)
				- problem-solving intents (filter/compare solutions, solve different problem, connect problem/solution, reduce problem/problem caus)
				- useful structures
				- solution/error success/failure case
				- useful structures applied to problem/solution structures
					- alternate problem input/solution output routes
			
			- alternate workflow versions
				- generalization/abstraction

			- select solutions

		- fulfill problem/solution interaction function
			- calculate cost of solving problem
			- remove problem/problem cause
			- reduce problem/problem cause
			- connect problem with solution
			- solve different problem
		
	- common functions that should be composable with structures like combination/application/specification/variation of general functions, which are components of workflows

		- find structure
			- find structure with attribute
