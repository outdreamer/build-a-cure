- to do:

	- identify useful intents of structural interactions and apply:
		
		- optimization/usefulness structures to components (data, learning function, input/output connection)
			- apply 'input-output sequence' structures to any structures that can or should be connected
		
		- interaction structures (combinations, sequences, networks) to all the variables
			- apply interface structures to interface structures
				- core cause structures

	- complete basic config lists
		- complete function lists
			- core interaction functions
		- complete attribute lists
			- solution/problem attributes/variables
		- complete structure lists
			- usefulness/organization/meaning/certainty/error/solution/optimization structures, etc
			- useful structures


- variables & configuration

	- problem-solving intents
		- filter solution space
		- reduce problem
		- solve different problem
		- change standard solution
		- check if solution metric is fulfilled

	- common functions
		- find input/output sequence
		- find alternate route
		- find filter to differentiate solution/error
		- find cause/intent/structure
		- identify type
		- apply interaction function to structures
		- differentiate/change
		- integrate/organize/fit

	- general alternate info existence functions (functions that find, derive or generate info, which can be used as alternate general problem-solving intents to resolve an info problem)
