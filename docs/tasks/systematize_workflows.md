- to do:

	- finish variable fit of how all the workflow variables fit together
		- functions
			- core interaction functions & interaction structures ('connect', 'combination')
			- general functions ('find', 'build', 'apply', 'derive', 'mean')
			- interim functions ('organize', 'standardize')
		- general problem-solving intents (not all intents need to be fulfilled for a given workflow, sometimes one intent is enough to qualify as a solution automation workflow)
			- 'filter solution space'
			- 'apply change to standard solution'
		- general useful interface structures
			- 'generative functions'
			- 'alternate routes'
		- solution automation workflows
			- 'break a problem into sub-problems & merge sub-solutions'
			- insight paths & other relevant structures to workflows (insight paths include all workflows which 'make finding solutions easier', but insight paths generally 'make finding insights/info easier' in some way)
				- 'apply cross-system insight patterns to other systems to predict insights'
			- interface queries
				- 'apply causal interface to identify cause of problem and solve alternate problem of "reducing problem cause"'
		- solution automation workflow attributes
			- 'solution success cause'
				- 'inputs to info like certainties/energy can be used to generate other info'
			- 'related object (workflow) network fit'
				- 'generalization of a workflow'
		- useful structures of solution automation workflows
			- 'generative functions' of 'solution automation workflows'
			- 'generative functions' of 'solution success cause'

		- fit

			- general functions are used for 'info existence' intents
				- before other functions can be applied, info has to exist (it has to be found, derived, generated, have structure from changes applied to other existing info, or have meaning in order to exist)
					- these functions can be used to find/derive/generate/apply/mean info in:
						- an interface query:
							- a problem type like 'find structures to solve an "info asymmetry" problem type'
							- a specific problem like 'find a structure'
						- a solution automation workflow:
							- problems in general like 'find info to solve info problems'
							- problems in a particular general format like 'find a function' or 'avoid errors' or 'find connections'
						- any function that finds/derives/generates/defines/applies info:
							- 'find a string matching another string'
							- 'find a solution having this attribute'
				- these functions are interchangeable
					- different general functions can be applied to solve a problem, like 'find a prediction function'
					- find: 'find a prediction function'
					- apply: 'apply changes to prediction function interface structures like prediction function patterns or components until the target prediction function is reached'
					- derive: 'apply interface structures like limits/requirements/errors to derive a prediction function, given what a prediction function is not'
					- generate: 'apply components of prediction functions to build a prediction function by combining/merging components of prediction functions'
					- mean: 'define the meaning of a prediction function (absolutely or in a given context) and filter possible prediction functions based on this definition'
			
			- interaction functions & structures ('connect', 'combination') can be used to specify/structure the implementation of a function

				- using specific interaction functions/structures creates a specific structural intent to fulfill when implementing a function
					
					- 'connect a problem/solution' is more specific & structural than 'relate a problem/solution', so using 'connect' is useful to get all the useful info associated with the 'connect' function, like:
						- the definitions of how it can interact with other objects, any related logic already defined for the function, clarity in how it can be applied
							- the definition of 'connect' implies a sequence of conversions linking states of the input/output, so applying it to a problem/solution indicates that the problem can be connected with the solution using a sequence of conversions
							- this provides a specific structure to look for (a 'sequence of conversion functions'), which is useful info for fulfilling the 'connect' intent & implementing the function
						- what its useful for, what inputs it can use & what outputs it can produce
							- 'connect' is useful for intents like 'equate', when objects should be equated bc theyre different by default (a problem is different from a solution)
							- 'connect' has outputs like a 'sequence of conversions/states/formats' and the target output (in this case, the target output is the 'solution')
				
				- this is generally useful for generating any function automatically

					- a requirement to generate functions may occur in an interface query, where sub-problems & corresponding sub-solution intents are identified, and a new function may need to be implemented automatically to fulfill that sub-problem-solving intent
					
					- example: if a component of an interface query such as the intent 'find the cause of a structure' is not an existing function, a function will need to be implemented automatically to fulfill that intent in the interface query
						- an example of how this would be implemented is a sub-interface query implementing a solution automation workflow that would be called by this interface query if a function is not found for this intent, to solve the problem of 'missing info' in the form of a 'missing function'
							- sub-problem: 'missing info of a function to connect cause & structure'
								- sub-problem: 'missing info about cause'
									- apply the 'connect problem/solution' solution automation workflow
										- output:
											- function to connect cause & info about cause: 
												- 'connect' 'definition' with 'cause'
								- sub-problem: 'missing info about the connection between cause & structure'
									- apply the 'connect problem/solution' solution automation workflow
										- output: 
											- function to connect cause & structure: 
												- 'connect' 'definition' of 'cause' with 'structure'
							- sub-problem: 'missing info about specific cause of the original problem structure'
								- apply function output by the query above to 'connect definition of cause with structure' to the 'specific structure' in the original problem
									- output:
										- 'specific cause' of 'specific structure' in original problem

	- apply interaction structures (combinations, sequences, networks) & interaction functions (embed, connect, reduce) to all the workflow variables
		- 'reduced' 'combination' of 'connections' between 'solution automation workflows' (reduced to unique values)
		- 'reduced' 'combination' of 'patterns' between 'solution automation workflows' (reduced to unique values)

	- identify useful intents of structural interactions (connect, optimize) & interactions of workflow variables where they would be useful
		- 'connect' useful for 'equating' which is useful for 'equating a problem/solution'

	- apply interface structures to interface structures & interaction structures (embed, connect)
		- default combination: 'core' 'cause' structures
		- embedded interface applied to default combination: 'intent' of 'core' 'cause' structures
		- connection between interfaces: common interaction structures like general function structure of 'merge' across interfaces 'meaning' & 'structure'

	- apply structures of each type
		- learning structures
		- relevance structures
		- interaction structures

	- apply structures for each core interaction function
		- reduce structures
		- embed structures
		- connect structures
			- apply 'connection' structures to structures that require connecting
				- apply 'input-output sequence' structures to any structures that can or should be connected

	- apply specific useful interface structures to workflow variables
		- requirements
			- requirements of workflow variables
		- efficiencies
			- workflow variables that make a task trivial (commonly useful workflows/functions)
		- ambiguities
			- the ambiguity present in variables like core interaction functions mean that any of the functions can be selected for a given workflow/interaction
		- related object network position (workflow fit)
		- generative structures
		- vertex variables
		- alternate workflow versions

	- complete basic config lists

			- useful structures


- variables & configuration

	- fit of variables

		- fit of functions

			- in between the general functions (find/generate/apply/mean) and the core interaction functions (connect, reduce, break, filter), there is an interim level of function interactions that sync with the interface query interaction level (identify, select, cause, standardize, organize, integrate)
				
				- similarity in interaction levels indicates various connections across these hierarchies

					- solution automation workflows ('filter solutions by what structures are not known errors'), having various general problem-solving intents ('filter solutions', 'differentiate solutions from errors')
						- interim functions ('compare/select solutions')
							- structural core interaction functions ('check if a solution is equal/similar to an error')

					- interface ('system')
						- interface structures ('conflict')
							- interface structures on other interfaces ('intersection' or 'diverging direction' or 'resource inequality' on the structural interface)
			
					- hierarchy connections
						- interim functions often use interface structures like contradictions bc interface structures represent interim structures between the abstract concept defining the interface (like cause or logic) and the structures in other systems that correspond to that interface's structures

				- general problem-solving intents for solving info problems
					- the general functions represent general intents fulfilling the structure 'information existence' (in order for info to exist from the perspective of the program, you have to find/derive/generate it)
				
				- specific problem-solving intent functions
					- functions like 'filter solution space' are interactions between structural core interaction functions and problem/solution structures
				
				- the interim functions connect the general & core interaction functions
					- 'organize' is the connecting function between the general function 'mean' and the structural function 'position'
					- 'integrate' is the connecting function between the general function 'mean' and the structural function 'merge'
					- these interim functions can be used to design interface queries to fulfill solution automation workflow core interaction functions involving general functions, if they dont use specific structural core interaction functions
						- example:
							- a solution automation workflow like 'find the meaning of a structure and check if it invalidates other meanings or is consistent as a way of finding possible structures to solve a problem in that system' has an interface query involving 'organize or integrate the structure with other structures to see if a contradiction can be created'

				- structural interaction functions
					- the core interaction functions fulfill common structural intents, not just common to problem/solution interactions but common in general
				
				- solution automation workflow functions
					- solution automation workflows are interaction structures of specific problem-solving intent functions
						- a workflow may fulfill the general problem-solving intent function 'filter solution space'
				
				- interface query functions
					- interface queries are interaction structures of interaction structures to fulfill a function intent (interim functinos, general problem-solving intents, solution automation workflow intents, core interaction functions, etc)
						- 'apply the "structure interface" to fulfill the "connect" core interaction function of the solution automation workflow "connect problem/solution structures"'
						- this calls the 'build' function (to create a 'connection' structure), which is fulfilled by calling the 'apply function' on an 'interface' structure
						- this is an 'embedded' interaction structure, where one interaction structure (apply) is embedded in another (build)
					- interface queries are an 'interaction structure of interaction structures' because they connect solution automation workflows with structural core interaction functions 
						- interface queries are a 'structural implementation' of a solution automation workflow

			- all functions use the general functions ('find') or a sub-function of them on some interaction level, whether its an interim level between general/structure functions ('select'/'compare') or structural level ('filter')

			- vertex variables
