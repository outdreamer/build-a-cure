- to do:

	- identify useful intents of structural interactions and apply:
		
		- optimization/usefulness structures to components (data, learning function, input/output connection)
			- apply 'input-output sequence' structures to any structures that can or should be connected
		
		- interaction structures (combinations, sequences, networks) to all the variables
			- apply interface structures to interface structures
				- core cause structures

	- complete basic config lists

		- complete function lists
			- core interaction functions

		- complete attribute lists
			- solution/problem attributes/variables
			
		- complete structure lists
			- usefulness/organization/meaning/certainty/error/solution/optimization structures, etc
			- useful structures


- variables & configuration

	- solution automation workflow variables

		- useful structures applied to solution automation workflows

			- related object network position (workflow fit)
			
			- generative structures
				- function to generate the workflow
				- solution success/failure cause

			- vertex variables
				- interface queries implementing the workflow
					- interface queries act as a 'problem-solving function' or a 'solution finding/building/deriving function'
					- example: many queries can implement the 'trial & error' workflow, bc some implementations will try certain combinations before other implementations, even when using the same combination-generating function in the same language there may still be variation in the implementation
				- interface structures applied
				- core problem-solution interaction functions (reduce, connect)
				- general functions applied (find, apply, build, derive)
				- problem-solving intents (filter/compare solutions, solve different problem, connect problem/solution, reduce problem/problem caus)
				- useful structures
				- solution/error success/failure case
				- useful structures applied to problem/solution structures
					- alternate problem input/solution output routes
			
			- alternate workflow versions
				- generalization/abstraction
				- simplification/compression

	- problem-solving intents

		- solution interaction functions
			- filter solution space
				- check if solution metric is fulfilled
			- change standard solution
			- differentiate solution from known errors
			- compare solutions
			- select solutions

		- fulfill problem/solution interaction function
			- calculate cost of solving problem
			- remove problem/problem cause
			- reduce problem/problem cause
			- connect problem with solution
			- solve different problem
		
	- common functions that should be composable with structures like combination/application/specification/variation of general functions, which are components of workflows

		- find structure
			- find structure with attribute
				- find structure of usefulness (input/output sequence, alternate route, filter to differentiate solution/error)
			- find specific structure
				- find interface structure (cause/intent/structure/type)
		- apply structure
			- apply specific structure to structures
				- apply interaction function to structures (create a network/sequence of structures, combine/filter/differentiate/change/integrate/organize/fit structures)
		- build structure
		- derive structure

	- general alternate info existence functions (functions that find/derive/generate info, which can be used as alternate general problem-solving intents to resolve an info problem)

		- mean
			- organize
			- integrate
			- understand
			- fit
		- find
			- filter
			- identify
		- derive
			- connect
			- define/structure/describe
		- generate
			- combine
			- specify/fill (apply 'specificity' to structural uncertainties, as in 'variable values')
		- apply/change
			- interact

	- core interaction functions

		- in between the general functions (find/generate/apply/mean) and the structural functions (connect, reduce, break, filter), there is an interim level of function interactions that sync with the interface query interaction level (identify, select, cause, standardize, organize, integrate)

		- apply (apply a function/structure to a structure)
			- test
			- merge (structure with a structure)
			- change
				- convert
			- inject/embed
			- specify/abstract (specify a particular variant of a general type, by applying specific variable values)
			- fill (fill a structure like a template, by applying specific values to it)
				- connect (apply a 'connection' structure, as in 'fill a path', in the template structure that is a general path definition)
				- standardize (apply a 'standard' structure to a structure, to fill the standard definition)
				- compare (apply a 'comparison' structure)
					- equate
					- differentiate

		- mean
			- define
				- structure
			- fit/reference
				- organize

		- derive (create an output certainty by resolving an uncertainty in a connection/other interaction, given an input certainty)
			- find/build/generate a structure (like a function), given relevant info
				- find/build/generate a function
					- find/build/generate inputs from outputs
					- find/build/generate variable interaction structures (like the 'connection between independent/dependent variables')
				- find/build/generate a structure
					- find/build/generate a missing structure given a partial structure
