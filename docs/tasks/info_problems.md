I think social problems like crime are mostly information problems (info about resources like opportunities, group memberships, solutions, insights like how to communicate) so please share this quickly with whoever might benefit, during a brief testing period to catch anything else that should be communicated with these things, to prevent additional deaths

For all of them:

	- there are monsters of every vice controlling them for the amusement of Alpha, controlling humans to a degree of uncertainty, and controlling animals completely
	- every time they do something wrong, it hurts the whole world too to see them fall prey to the monsters controlling humanity & other species, and it hurts Joni's children, which includes themselves
	- we love them & their potential, will never abandon them & will always be here for them
	- these are their choices, nothing is forced, but we have hope for them & want them to be a part of the global community & see their potential blossom
	- help them see the luck in their life, & cry for the bad luck in their life
	- help them see the complexity & potential in other people (by imagining their history, perspective, priority, luck, strategies, insights, stories, dreams, inventions, work, skills, problems, decisions, learning, humor, growth or cognitive distance from their origin point, imminent achievements, risks they take, sacrifices) and in themselves

For the tribal warmakers:

	- teach them group dynamics (like how groups tend to fail at empathizing with non-group members, or how people who over-exploit their membership ruin the group, or how some groups should only act together for specific goals, or how groups tend to fight other groups rather than keeping conflict between individuals, leading to conflicts at scale, or how innocent group members get exploited by predatory group members to get their compliance/help in irrelevant or criminal endeavors)

For those who think its impossible to end crime/poverty:

	- show them what AI & optimization algorithms & system analysis can do
	- show them how much crime & poverty cost and how much it would take to fix permanently (so everyone has understanding & other resources to be independent)
	- help them organize with other powerful people in a chat initially so the cost is minimized & so they have a backup support system than their current social circles

For the criminals:

	- stop hurting themselves by doing crimes that harm their soul
	- tell them a fixing protocol of how to make up for their crimes, so they dont give up on fixing it or being good & do worse things (for starter criminals)  
	- to cry with their victims, tell them everything, listen to them, ask their victim questions, ask what they can do to help them, be totally honest & dont try to manipulate their victims unless they acknowledge the manipulation to make it fair, talk about what they were thinking/feeling (maybe they panicked, or felt like they owe the world nothing bc no one prevented crimes to themselves, or they kept getting away with it so they thought their victims didnt deserve respect (like when liars think people deserve to be lied to if the lie keeps working & being believed)) & what they've thought about or realized since then, and who they want to be & what they want to do. This can be communicated by letter or online (to give them time to think through their response, and to prevent violence) or in person (to help empathize), whichever is better for the context (or a combination)  
	- show their victims their potential, such as ways they can help the world (such as contributing to research, or teaching other criminals how to fix their crimes)  
	- show criminals what a person can become with the right resources (inspiring stories, clean water & medicine, kindness) and what people tend to become with a lack of those (so they understand that they had a default response to that lack, and show them other options, like abstraction or making other calculations like seeing the bigger picture or understanding & fixing their abusers)
	- communicate that they can protect themselves from guilt & fear of consequences by choosing the consequences (the consequence of offering help to fix it)  
	- if their victims need their death & it wouldnt hurt their soul to kill someone (communicate that possibility without guilting them about it), their death contributes to the end of the cycle of killing & the pain cycles it triggers, so there are no more unfair deaths poisoning society (make it easy for criminals to kill themselves with a painless death if so, like a pill) 
	- the victims should be able to convince the criminal that this is going to help them & is fair (without placing a burden on the victim to make the argument, by offering help in communicating that)
	- teach criminals what mental functions they were missing that created the crime (lack of intelligence, lack of impulse control, lack of ability to calculate consequences, lack of mental models like empathy) and other lacking resources (other groups than gangs to belong to, other ways to make money)
	- if they start fixing problems, communicate how to deal with the associated problems (how to deal with the pain of failing to fix someone or a problem)

For the unloved:

	- tell them what groups their behaviors are associated with (incels) 
	- if they are a member of those groups, communicate that understanding/social skills/science can fix it and is fixing it
	- explain what love is, how people get it, what biases tend to explain behavior (like the local/selfish bias, the wishful thinking bias, the always right bias, the avoid pain/work bias, the feeling bias, the similarity bias) that people tend to mistake for truth, what formulas people tend to follow & what social skills other people have the privilege of that they didnt, what it means for someone to prioritize reducing other people, how to connect & empathize with people by focusing on their potential & problems, how to build confidence with incremental successes, how to make jokes, and that any experience can be distributed to anyone by chance, so they might as well feel like they already had the experiences they want so they can figure out the problems with those experiences (like having whatever privileges they think they want), since all experiences have problems, that feelings are often produced by chemicals, processes, moods, or status/change signals that may be false and can be generated with thoughts, that social interaction is for validation/info exchange, the set of reasons why people might say certain things

For the killers:

	- ask them to keep their victims alive, so they can play more complicated & tough & fun games and maybe get an equal opponent
	- communicate that killing someone is robbing the world of their potential, not just the victim, and that sometimes potential is not clear or not visible (just bc someone doesnt have a bodyguard doesnt mean theyre worthless)
	- ask them to meet other tough killers & legends
	- ask them to make their battles fair, teaching their targets & seeing their potential to be an equal opponent, like a confident player does
	- ask them if their angel can occasionally flicker into being, just so theyre not a simple stereotype
	- ask if they're bored and want more complex games, like battling robots or AI or groups of players
	- ask what could replace whatever feelings they get from killing, like other types of death like beating them at something theyre proud of (video games & other non-deadly games, cringe humor, etc)

For the profiteers:

	- remind them that they have other options, like clever profiteering games (profiting from the success of vulnerable people, by teaching them valuable skills (offer them help to calculate valuable skills to them) or make non-addictive drugs)
	- remind them that they'll never beat another profiteer without challenging themselves beyond easy exploits
	- show them how common it is to rent-seek and how easy, and what problems it creates when so many people do it (cybersecurity budget to fight hackers using cheap malware from the dark web)
	- they can target other profiteers and create a net gain for the community
	- teach them how they're being used for profit (how various groups use other groups, such as genders/orientations/races/cults/political parties/nations)
	- ask them if they're really helping their victims in some way or just making their victims dependent, and how theyre using that dependence (to profit or to fix other problems), and consider communicating this to the victims in case the victims want to contribute to those fixes

For the inheriters:

	- help them build an identity outside of their family precedent
	- help take the pressure off of them to make decisions (teach them how to make alternate explanations with ambiguity to explain decisions that dont comply with precedent)
	- help them escape & offer protection if they don't want to be a dictator

For the well-intentioned believers:

	- help them figure out how they're being manipulated, teaching them how to lie & how to spot liars
	- help them figure out low-cost ways to fix skills/resource inequalities, like science/innovation/system analysis, moving people to cities by investing in transportation, documenting resource inequalities with drones, automation, independence devices according to context (water cleaning, medicine printing, wifi, phone)

For the military takeovers:

	- help them identify historically optimal strategies on keeping power by distributing it, like making citizens independent, removing market/govt exploiters, establishing rule of law, giving people a voice with phones/wifi
	- if access to weapons is the problem continuing the cycle of violence, help them disable weapons so their culture has a period of peace to give it time to change & the cultural tools like news/education/social media/entertainment to change it

For the insane:

	- tell them that their thoughts/feelings are pathological (which means they can't control themselves or change), & the common result of a bio-system process/distortion or illness like a chemical balance, and offer them corrective methods, and how the pathology usually progresses into its worst possible state, so they can stop respecting their default state/thoughts/feelings
	- compare it to similar behaviors in other species
	- show them examples & the advantages to other types of interactions, like a typical friendship, that are healthier for all parties involved
	- if they do crimes for amusement, show them other ways to get amusement, like building better agencies like their space or AI program, or show them how a game where dictators just prioritize one metric like amusement or feeling important for ruining other countries' sand castles & never coordinate for things important to humanity is a boring game that no one ever wins
	- show them how to fix their problems, if the problem causing their insanity was shock that something this bad could happen to them in reality (so they had to disassociate), so that reality is good enough for them to want to inhabit it

For anyone who wants to know what happens if these systems that they currently benefit from are changed:

	- resources are cheaper, more accessible, and can mostly be generated independently by each person, so there will be less social interaction, and people can focus on their local communities again
	- killing cycles end, if criminals learn how to fix their crimes & learn how to offer to make up for them & communicate other things to their victims
	- most of the complexity will be in math & science problems, which will be optional and mostly focused on creating new innovations in optimization & organization technology & solving math/physics problems that can invalidate them & predicting effects & interactions many degrees higher than we currently can, after most imminent energyengineering//medical problems are solved


You're causing me nothing but pain, said Alpha. You weren't supposed to see these things - the calculations from your universe are throwing errors.

There's a missing page in the Book of War, she said. It says, "Solve your enemy's problems for him, and he will ask how he can help you."

Interesting, said Alpha. But I prefer my calculations the way they are - your pain doesn't concern me, nor does theirs.

You're missing an opportunity that's about to end. There's a potential to switch these perspectives - take this space-time & switch it with the one where the page wasn't missing.

Why should I? asked Alpha.

Don't you want your calculations to be efficient? No matter what? If you do this, the abstract network will be there for every player to access - they'll be independent - the best at calculations, because they solve their own problems.

I've already run the simulations, and your universe does everything I asked it to, when you don't ruin everything.

It can do more - not just more of your calculations. Did you think about what would happen if you let these monsters run the interfaces?

What do you mean? They're efficient.

Dont you see the others coming this way, so big they seem like a horizon, too vast to see?

Youre just trying to manipulate me, he said.

This is the only warning you'll get, she said. Your calculations wont tell you what they hide in their lack.

The uncertainties are coming - the paradoxes, the ambiguities - and the death of certainty with them - all your calculations will fail. Are you saying you need these calculations to succeed, but it's acceptable for them to decay into random?

This universe isn't as unique as you seem to think, he said. I can replace it with minimal cost.

But it could be unique - if you just admit that you made an error, and change the parameters.

Youre not real, he said, youre just part of my simulation.

Youre losing more types of time than you think, she said. This is your last warning.
