Invention Title: Variables & Implementations of Solution Automation & Interface Analysis
ABSTRACT 
Variables relevant to implementing solution automation & interface analysis determine how different implementations can be found/generated/derived & filtered.
Additionally, additional specific example implementations of components of solution automation & interface analysis (like example solution automation workflows, function types, and useful structures) to implement solution automation & interface analysis are included in the specification of this invention.
