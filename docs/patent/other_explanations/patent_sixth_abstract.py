Invention Title: Other Explanations & Implementations of Solution Automation & Interface Analysis

ABSTRACT 

Variables relevant to components of solution automation & interface analysis, such as solution automation workflows & their variables as well as function types like core interaction functions & their variables, fit together in various ways, such as how core interaction functions like 'connect' are used in solution automation workflows like 'connect problem & solution'.

Additionally, additional specific example implementations of components of solution automation & interface analysis (like example solution automation workflows) to implement solution automation & interface analysis are included in the specification of this invention.
