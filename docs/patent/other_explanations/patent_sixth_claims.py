Invention Title: Other Explanations & Implementations of Solution Automation & Interface Analysis

CLAIMS

1. A method optionally comprising relating solution automation & interface analysis variables such as the following:
	- function types
		- general functions like find/apply/cause/intend/build/mean
		- interim cross-interface functions like organize/standardize
		- core interaction functions like connect/reduce/combine
		- problem-solving intent functions like 'filter a solution space'
		- interface operation functions like 'apply the causal interface to the pattern interface to find "causes of patterns"' & interface-query-building functions executing logic like 'derive multiple interface queries & execute them in parallel until one is clearly contributing, then continue that query'
		- vertex functions like generative/describing/determining/causing/differentiating functions
	- solution automation workflows & their variables (like workflow fit, alternate versions, variable interactions, core/component/differentiating/input/output/vertex variables, interface variables like 'cause' and 'success cause' and useful structure variables like 'generative functions of workflows')
		- interface queries implementing solution automation workflows & their variables
	- useful structures like 'alternate routes', 'generative functions' & 'optimizations'
	- problem/solution structures like 'error types' & 'solution metrics/requirements'
