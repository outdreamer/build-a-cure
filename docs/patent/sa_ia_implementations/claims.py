	- randomness problem format & organization solution format 
	- conflicting direction problem format & aligning re-routing solution format
	- reduction problem format & expansion/standardization solution format
	- lack problem format & generative efficiency solution format
	- identify problem format & uniqueness solution format

5. The method of claim 1, wherein example implementations of insight paths can be used to identify relevant problem/solution structures (like connections between variables) & exclude relevant problem/solution structures more optimally.

6. The method of claim 1, wherein example implementations of functions generating solution automation workflow insight paths (which connect problem/solution formats) may include permutations of structures of problem/solution components like variables/structures (such as formats, component/adjacent/proxy structures, origin/target position/state, connecting functions, definitions, workflows, attributes like complexity, etc).

7. The method of claim 1, wherein example implementations of query-building logic may include logic to select an interface to traverse, selecting multiple interface queries to execute in parallel, & organizing interfaces to traverse in a structure like a sequence.
