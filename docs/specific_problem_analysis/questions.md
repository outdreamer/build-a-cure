# Questions for humanity


1. What are your perspectives & priorities? What are your definitions of metrics like success/value, & concepts like justice, love, power, & freedom?

2. What ideas do you love?

3. Where do you allocate your pain (standard learning tool)? How do you organize your pain (just the information learned, as a function, etc)?

4. How do you organize your brain? Do you separate feelings from information? Do you put truth filters in front of your information storage? Do you have an organizing concept like balance governing your brain? Do you have a set of decision functions for different information? Do you have a set of perspectives to use as a backup? Do you have certain games set as default interactions?

5. Where do you look for meaning (your identity, similarity, freedom, power, challenges, superiority, connections, potential, learning)?

6. What do you share? What do you fix? What do you sacrifice? What trades do you make? Do you convert problems into other problems, questions, missed opportunities, strategies, answers, secrets, jokes, or useful tools for people?

7. What rules do you question or assume? What are your variables & constants?

8. When & why do you change? Can you change your motivations?

9. What do you remember? How do you convert your memories into meaning? What moments & stories do you use as maps?

10. What structures do you find in your life (toxic cycles, forced decisions, question traps, other people's stories, core functions)? Can you/should you change them? How do you handle structures (attributes, functions, routes, limits, groups, origins, extremes & optimals)?

11. Where do you allocate your decisions? What do you do by default? What do you calculate, analyze & test for? 

12. When & how do you use your emotions, attention, curiosity, work, & intelligence? What do you aim them at?

13. Where are the interfaces & interface components (problems, uncertainties, risk, randomness, meaning, & potential) in your life? What makes you wonder or want to know more? 


# Humanity structures

    - what metadata (count, type) of the following variable structures are a person allowed/required:

    	- structures
	    	- moments
    		- pivots
    		- moves/positions/gaps/limits/boundaries/intersections/combinations/extremes
    		- paths/rules/connections (functions, ratios)
    		- systems
    		- variables
    		- origin/destination
    		- similarities/differences/distortions

    	- variables
    		- access/status
    		- metrics/calculations
    		- roles/responsibilities
    		- assumptions/dependencies
    		- protection/rights/property/sharing
    		- empathy/sympathy/apathy
    		- judgment, criticism, understanding, explanations, feelings
	    	- optimizations/improvements
	    	- alternatives/decisions
	    	- games/strategies
	    	- agency (freedom/power/independence): random, accidental, default, bias, misunderstanding, learning, intentional, & powerful
	    	- insanity & mass hallucinations
	    	- laws/decrees/suggestions
	    	- expectations/promises/dreams
	    	- gods/allies/enemies
	    	- education/learning
	    	- organization
	    	- system objects (incentives, efficiencies)
	    	- favors
	    	- realities
	    	- belief/disbelief/trust/opinion
	    	- time
	    	- concepts (power, balance, truth)
	 	    - virtues/vices
	    	- cause
	    	- change
	    	- abstraction/automation
	    	- variance/potential
	    	- bias/fallacies
	    	- perspectives
    		- intent/priorities
			- controversy
			- achievements
			- standards/frameworks/tools
			- logic
			- ego/identity/memories
			- mysteries/lies/excuses/facts
			- problems/questions/errors
			- solutions/answers/corrections
			- bets/predictions/risks
			- coincidences/opportunities/possibilities/probabilities/certaintiee/chances/acceptance

	- what are the optimal structures of relationships between these components?
		- do they have reasons (plans, strategies, investments) for their decisions or just granular intents (short-term specific local goals)
		- do they have suggestions for problems?
		- do they align their achievements in a way that creates opportunities for more?
		- do they have logic to go with their opinions?
		- do they have solutions to go with their criticisms?

# Ethical position matrix

	- interactions of the following ethically relevant objects:

		- attributes:
			- morality: good/evil
				- related objects: conscience, ethical rules, the right thing
			- requirements/assumptions/responsibilities
			- conditions (future/past/unknown)
			- probability
			- potential
			- fairness
			- agency/intelligence
			- events/decisions
			- information
			- related objects (possessed info objects, relationships)
			- characters/roles
			- status/trajectory/origin/destination
			- intent
			- feelings
			- state/time
			- simplicity
			- relevance/importance
			- understanding

		- structures:
			- is/not/and/but
			- direction
			- spectrum
			- combination
			- vertexes
				- related objects: description/summary/encapsulation
			- dependencies
			- dichotomy
			- threshold
			- above/below
			- in-between
			- lack (missing info, rule gap)
			- info gap
				- related objects: ambiguity, minimum information
			- metric
			- interaction layer
			- similarities/differences


	- what are the optimal structures of relationships between these components?

		- should potential be examined in every ethical situation, or is there a certain lack of potential in some situations?
		- what is the correct sequence of objects (apply empathy, apply existing solutions, build new solutions, educate so they can fix it themselves, required work assignment, condemnation)
		- what is the role that time, information, origin & status play in ethics? (is origin location a determining factor in a high percent of events)
		- what are the vertexes (determining/describing/generating variables that act as potential interfaces for change to develop)
		- what is the correct structure of feelings (backup alternative input to useful functions like powering work/motivating towards a goal)
