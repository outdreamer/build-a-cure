- automation

  - manual code should only be used when there's an unsolved problem in a domain that doesnt respond to algorithmically determined solutions (when optimization of implementation is uncertain), otherwise algorithms should be selecting code
  
  - soon users will be able to select & add features to apps automatically, invalidating the app market
    - add a prepay option for features that can be built by a deadline if enough people prepay, as an alternative to monopoly abuse of power by not fulfilling user needs
  - automated product quality testing (to invalidate reviews & product endorsements from the platform) & faster delivery service as competition to amazon

  - browser optimizing web sites based on clear feature-execution mismatch created by malware or outdated code given origin code intent, a ratio of version/other change allowed, intent of site actions (not making changes that would break other functionality calculatable on the page)
    - browser configurations like versions/modes/settings applied for tabs

  - intent implemented on the web could look like approved workflows for accessing a site or across sites, where actions, requests or workflows can be pre-purchased and approved algorithmically 
      ('how to build a bomb' search isnt purchaseable with a 'purchase chemical' request or across purchase bundles)

  - product platform:
    - filters: predicting filters that will be used the most (features that differentiate products and alternate purchases the most)
    - products: product query language ('product with feature x and without component y')
    - supplies:
      - adjacent supply cost estimation ('adjacent product built from these suppliers would cost x')
      - estimate future demand & estimate cost of production methods (how many times will you need it? if above x, then its more cost effective to build it yourself, buy from these suppliers with price-lowering trends, buy this robot to make it regularly, or build a robot to do it - plus the timed sequence of those purchases for most cost effectiveness)
    - code as solutions:
      - code search (code as product solutions, like code to print a product or code to predict a compound or adjust vitamin combination as needed)
      - feature-to-code translation ('need a product with existing feature x and add new feature y')

  - multiple servers/processors in one computer with one-way data transfers, so one server can be for local communication, one can be for offline work, one can be for browsing internet, and local/offline can communicate to internet-browing processor but not the other way around

  - rules-to-code translation tool - translating domain-specific plain language rules to robot code can be short-term useful for automation of service industry tasks like:
    - converting recipes/flavor-mixing strategies to cooking robot code (chefs can use a tool like this to make money short-term or sell their rules, if they have unique strategies)
    - converting new plant designs to genome editing code
    - converting local social insights to global code (avoid personalities like this, use these tactics to persuade, make this argument to get them to an insight position, etc)
    - converting adaptation insights to change-attracting system adaptation code
    - converting routing mechanisms/optimizations to drone code (short-term human insights like 'avoiding a particular street bc of construction' that data isnt adequate for)
    - the general task of converting rule sets (systems) or human-made visuals (graphs, blueprints) to code

    - machine learning can be used for initial conversion, then tweaked with coded filters like priorities, logic, organization, output
    - system analysis can be used to optimize beyond those standard filters
    - this needs to identify existing rules (or specific versions of abstract rules, distorted versions of standard rules) & filter them out
    - this is an alternative & and an interim step to raw code-generation given a set of intents
  
  - smart contracts for browser, to grant permissions to various web events/user actions for a particular session
    When you log in, you create a mini contract saying what you intend to do, and if behavior deviates outside of what the contract supports, the session is terminated
