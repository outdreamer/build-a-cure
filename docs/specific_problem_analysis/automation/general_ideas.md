- code

  - anti-stupidity addiction counseling & meditation app, fixing addictions & related error types with incrementally slightly less evil replacements:
    - racism by convincing them there are non-racial groups that deserve hatred more ("hey Sharon, you're so right about the Jews, they absolutely cared about covering up their space weapons program enough to serve you that ad about fun outdoor non-genocide activities in your area, but you know who I hate more - wiccans with vegan pets" could be all it takes to wean Sharon off of her ethnic hatred so she can write manifestos about the behaviors she hates instead)
    - jealousy, by convincing them there are other people more deserving of jealousy, such as people who don't feel it bc they're the best ("my dearest Beatrice, rather than trying to criminalize your male coworkers complimenting someone else, dare I suggest developing intelligence so you can create any asset your heart desires" can fix Beatrice so she fulfills her destiny of being the recipient of increasingly & unnecessarily dramatic letters)
    - false hope that their new accessory, new dance move, brow grooming technique, or another just barely acceptable trait is giving everyone the jels ("have mercy Kevin, your false eyelashes are murdering our will to live, an asset that is literally necessary for life, which is technically murder" could inspire Kevin to dim his own light to let others shine for once, since absolutely everything is able to kill someone's will to live, if you just wish on a shooting star & believe & if theyre a total dweeb hurt by everything)
    - victim complex, convincing them there are actual problems, and that they have actual power to fix the illusory problems they think they're a victim of ("oh my god, are you ok? why is the red cross trying to help sex trafficking & genocide victims, when that cake just forced you to eat it?" could alert Pamela to the fact that she does in fact have superpowers instead of victimhood, powers like fixing her impulse control (the stronger she'll be to strangle us), or alternatively, her priorities (the better to crucify us with)
    - god complex, convincing them that they are not in fact allowed to murder other people who happen to exist, which they take as an intentional malicious reminder about their own mistakes ("no Lisa, someone else having something out of your intellectual price range is not justification for altering international human rights terminology just this once to justify what you did to them" could be the wake-up call Lisa needed to acknowledge her own limitations)
    - judging addiction, where they act like anyone trusts their judgment and thinks they're incapable of hypocrisy ("sure Chrissy, we'll punish all your victims youre jealous of who did nothing to you, we totally trust that you're not jealous of them, since you only told us to punish them bc you want the best for us, in your infinite wisdom, not bc you think that if we can't interact with them, we'll someday start to think you're great")
    - lying addiction, where they say stuff that is clearly false bc they think its "play pretend" time all the time and pointing out lies is "violating the social contract" in some way ("sure Chrissy, youre saying we should all have kids bc you think its the right thing to do, not bc you want every woman's body to be ruined" might trigger a thought in Chrissy's mind, like that she might not be great at hiding her intentions, which are a shade less complicated & interesting than she claims)
    - self-nominating sainthood of their own religion, where they act holy & concerned about their homicide victims so they make sure to check their email every day in case today is the day they need to act sad about their victims' deaths ("sure Martha, that bake sale almost ended all oppression & inequality - it's like you invented something that changed the world and made all problems trivial to solve, but slightly different in that your strategy didn't work bc people persecuted you for being better than them (at pretending decorating cookies is the only thing that has ever mattered)" might alert Martha to the possibility of other strategies to seem good, like actually being good)

  - assess fair use of copied code by:
    - how much effort it would have been to not copy (if its low-effort to not copy, there's no reason to copy)
    - ratio of value contributed by those lines (such as by the cost of bugs caused by distorting the line)
    - difficulty (cognitive distance) of inventing that product given what had been invented prior to that
    - ratio of total value that the code can generate (what other software can it generate, what can it automate)

  - function to convert article/listing/social posts into variables to enable queries (product with feature x in budget y that integrates with app z and has attribute independent)

  - authorized pick-ups/drop-offs by people in your social circle, extra keys for drop-off in lock boxes or cars, picking up packages from warehouses

  - vpn's & proxy servers to enable protection functions (viewing science research or medical info) by: 
    - automatically finding countries with laws allowing those protected functions & routing requests from servers in those locations
    - finding a version of an app that has target features so user is directed to download for that versions

  - grassroots citizen info tech & citizen journalism as an alternative to top-down govt law enforcement, where centralized/organized govt law enforcement is allocated when a metric threshold for citizen reports is reached
    - the correct position of govt is an automated tool usable by citizens to solve problems (prevent crime, enforce laws, exact justice)

  - usb that stores os/state/processes/files so when you take it out, all thats left is hardware, so secure portable destructible readonly sessions (or sessions allowing only one write at a time, from a user-facing process like a document editor, with regular approval requests to re-authenticate writes or session) can take place
  
  - solution investing app
    - Is the cost (implementation/opportunity/mgmt/bug-fixing costs & lost previous work/equipment value) higher than the benefit?
      It's a technology if its problems solved/created ratio & relative feature value is high enough; if not, it's just a tax/debt
      We don't need to create problems to create jobs, we need guaranteed scientist jobs to handle existing science problems
      Companies/agencies should exist to manage/build solutions to existing science problems (pay this company $x to get y% of pollution removed from outdoor air)
      Taxes are a relatively inefficient & obscure way to allocate funds to these public good solutions, compared to product purchase payment plans
      People should be able to see what their taxes are funding & opt-out to invest in other products/companies
      - example: "avoid a local road that needs local govt budget to repair, to decide where to route funds to more important projects"
      There should be an app to opt-out of taxes if they agree not to use local resources those taxes pay for
      Companies can have efficiency & problem-solving scores (problem-solution, solution metrics, cost/benefit, hidden costs, time to solution, problem solved/created metrics) in a solution investing app to win investments from citizen investors to solve problems relevant to them
      - identify which companies/traders have the right market signals or info by retroactively analyzing historical data about which agents' investments turned out to be correct in the intended investing timeframe

  - apply intents & other interfaces to other decision (transaction) types (code transactions, financial transactions, legal transactions)
    - code transactions (user action like 'clicking a button' or 'running a script' indicates what intents, according to relevant system contexts, like applicable laws/protocols)
    - resource transactions (financial resource trades), to manage intents of a transaction - money is deposited on resource delivery, otherwise in pending state for x days agreed on by agents
    - legal transactions (allow laws to be passed having any of a limited list of approved intents)

  - finding necessary forms for an intent subject to indexed rules like laws, filling them out, and optionally filtering info by regulations cited in forms, including relevant regulations applied
    - involves automated calls/faxes to request/send forms, where processes/forms arent online, like how calls to find appointments are automated
      - involves functions to:
        - derive steps to complete the task in the right sequence/decision tree/flow chart structure (fill out form, fax form, consult legal consultant, review auto-filled input)
        - derive steps in the digitized process (log in, submit form, schedule appointment)
        - find & apply relevant regulations
        - find related forms
        - auto-fill forms
        - derive & execute steps to complete sub-tasks (like 'send a form' or 'schedule an appointment')
        - identify & highlight input that needs manual review
        - find people with expertise to guide manual review (legal consultant, govt employee)
        - digitize process (auto-import to workflow management tool or multi-step form component)

    - alternatively an automated process to digitize a process/form with necessary security, search functionality, and integration with other services/processes as digitization tool variabless
    - the tool should be able to submit user-permitted/submitted input to a preliminary process (like 'apply for a license' or 'submit voter registration') form (like a wsdl, other api spec, url with html form, or just a form pdf template with unfilled fields) and guess the values based on accessible inputs (user address info), then lookup any relevant regulations or related forms & fill out those forms or apply the regulations, and then return suggested output, with highlighting for missing fields or predicted fields with certainty below threshold that user or a legal consultant can manually review, and a list of remaining action items, which can be triggered if the user is ok with the output or updates the output, such as faxing/sending/printing/mailing the form on remote servers or using task-running apps to find a person willing to run the errand, or scheduling a call/appointment (like a dmv appointment).
    - this should also be applicable to software updates (submit a current request to a current wsdl, and find/apply relevant or recent govt regulation updates as well as web protocol updates to generate updated wsdl/request/response as well as request/response wrapper/handling functions, like updating new field names or request structures in codebase)

  - search of local product supplies across exchanges

- search ideas

      - inferring useful search filters based on customer usage history & intent
        - linked searches/user data with type/intent identification - if they are in a location with a certain pathogen and they search for cleaners, theyre probably trying to clean that pathogen so cleaners should be specific or at least an optional search results set should be linked to
      - automated attribute extraction/addition to search as a filter
      - search results as graphs: variables entered in search to display relationships found in data or graph images or graphetized articles
      - processed (aggregated) results - find the average/combined or plain language definition when searching for a definition
      - predicting what questions theyll ask next and adding those search results (or a summary) on the side
      - intent-based search guidance:
        - usually people who search for an answer are studying for a test, so additional widgets like suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'study guides', 'summaries', 'tutorials'
        - people searching for recipes are hosting a party & cooking other things, so suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'flavor graphs'
        - people searching for symptoms are trying to diagnose themselves or someone else, so suggested content could include links to diagnostic tools or graphs of symptom set frequency for conditions

      - automatic aggregated information formatting queries as an alternative to unstructured/keyword searches pointing to isolated content in manually entered formats like:
        - 'show me stock/financial instrument/cryptocurrency popularity data in graph format' and the output would be a graph of relative usage statistics available, with suggested content links to definitions of the financial instruments since that's a related intent to looking up their popularity, which implies an intent to invest/profit
        - 'show me product search data according to demos in a table with sorts' and the output would be a table with product search data by age group, economic group, in a table format, with sorts to sort each column
        - 'show me insights from language tutorials' would return a list of insights about learning a language, which is a primary implied intent of that search, with suggested content links to music in that language which is one way to learn a language
        - this would be done by:
          - using previous queries & feedback on search results
          - auto-formatting
          - aggregated data from existing content
          - pulling definitions of keywords like 'demos' to determine what supported keyword they mean, or create a new term out of core functions (groups separated by attribute & attribute value)

      - graph search (with queries like 'show me relationship between time and gdp' or show me relationship between using lysol and cancer')
        - could scan studies related to graph for logical fallacies and adjust graph accordingly, then present a composite graph of data found
        - data from searches & product purchases can be integrated into graph (buying lysol followed by searches for cancer symptoms)
        - 'deploy an AI model to do tasks: find/predict relationship, categorize, or rank' option can be included to train on public data based on plain language queries like the above

      - search data + verified purchases can be used to assess the value of a particular product solution for a problem (like a supplement to treat a health condition), to offset fake reviews or faulty recommendation/removal algorithm or account for product fixes over time, as well as customize it to the user (avoid this product if you have condition x, this product has correlation with onset of condition y
        - customization can also be done for user groups like intelligence - so people likelier to believe a story without checking it like anti-vaxx stories can be shown true stories with more repetition
        - example of a system object being useful for customatization (a false categorization):
          - busy can look like stupidity under certain circumstances - what are those circumstances and when are they most important to avoid 
            (if someone's too busy to check a news site, send them a notification about a pandemic so theyre likelier to see it)
