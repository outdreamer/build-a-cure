- search ideas

      - inferring useful search filters based on customer usage history & intent
        - linked searches/user data with type/intent identification - if they are in a location with a certain pathogen and they search for cleaners, theyre probably trying to clean that pathogen so cleaners should be specific or at least an optional search results set should be linked to
      - automated attribute extraction/addition to search as a filter
      - search results as graphs: variables entered in search to display relationships found in data or graph images or graphetized articles
      - processed (aggregated) results - find the average/combined or plain language definition when searching for a definition
      - predicting what questions theyll ask next and adding those search results (or a summary) on the side
      - intent-based search guidance:
        - usually people who search for an answer are studying for a test, so additional widgets like suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'study guides', 'summaries', 'tutorials'
        - people searching for recipes are hosting a party & cooking other things, so suggested content could include snapshots of/links to: 'flavor graphs'
        - people searching for symptoms are trying to diagnose themselves or someone else, so suggested content could include links to diagnostic tools or graphs of symptom set frequency for conditions

      - automatic aggregated information formatting queries as an alternative to unstructured/keyword searches pointing to isolated content in manually entered formats like:
        - 'show me stock/financial instrument/cryptocurrency popularity data in graph format' and the output would be a graph of relative usage statistics available, with suggested content links to definitions of the financial instruments since that's a related intent to looking up their popularity, which implies an intent to invest/profit
        - 'show me product search data according to demos in a table with sorts' and the output would be a table with product search data by age group, economic group, in a table format, with sorts to sort each column
        - 'show me insights from language tutorials' would return a list of insights about learning a language, which is a primary implied intent of that search, with suggested content links to music in that language which is one way to learn a language
        - this would be done by:
          - using previous queries & feedback on search results
          - auto-formatting
          - aggregated data from existing content
          - pulling definitions of keywords like 'demos' to determine what supported keyword they mean, or create a new term out of core functions (groups separated by attribute & attribute value)

      - graph search (with queries like 'show me relationship between time and gdp' or show me relationship between using lysol and cancer')
        - could scan studies related to graph for logical fallacies and adjust graph accordingly, then present a composite graph of data found
        - data from searches & product purchases can be integrated into graph (buying lysol followed by searches for cancer symptoms)
        - 'deploy an AI model to do tasks: find/predict relationship, categorize, or rank' option can be included to train on public data based on plain language queries like the above

      - search data + verified purchases can be used to assess the value of a particular product solution for a problem (like a supplement to treat a health condition), to offset fake reviews or faulty recommendation/removal algorithm or account for product fixes over time, as well as customize it to the user (avoid this product if you have condition x, this product has correlation with onset of condition y
        - customization can also be done for user groups like intelligence - so people likelier to believe a story without checking it like anti-vaxx stories can be shown true stories with more repetition
        - example of a system object being useful for customatization (a false categorization):
          - busy can look like stupidity under certain circumstances - what are those circumstances and when are they most important to avoid 
            (if someone's too busy to check a news site, send them a notification about a pandemic so theyre likelier to see it)
