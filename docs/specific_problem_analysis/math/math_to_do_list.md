    - identify core graph variables (definition of adjacence/difference, connectivity, dimensions, info storage methods, interactivity of structures like sequences)
    - make a function network of math domains (inputs/outputs of geometry, algebra, calculus that align)

    - examine connection between fractals, sequences, averages, origins, multipliers (self, as in power), & circles
      - fractals as a relevant structure for adding sequences of fractions (adding numbers similar to itself on a smaller scale, infinitely) as a way of producing inputs to circles created by transforming a fractal spiral, where the origin is the original number as a base for applying increasingly smaller scales
      - the set of points forming roots of an infinite negative number sequence (roots of unity, rather than roots of any negative integer number) as a way of producing a circle because of their common distance to their average (center) forming the radius
      - lines of equal length having a common average point (center/origin)
      - fractals & infinite sequences as a way of calculating area under a continuous line (increasing small subsets of structures with area calculatable with multiplication of x & y)
      - what continuous line segments would have an area equal to a circle of relevant proportions?

    - example of visualizing higher dimensions with changes in a network of visualizable variable subsets like:
      - dimension subsets: displaying dimension subsets in groups of sizes that are already visualizable (from 1 - 4 dimensions), where orthogonality is preserved across the network of subsets
      - dimension groups: grouping similar dimensional changes into a change type across a dimension subset, to visualize the change types
      - relevant (robust) dimensions
        - dimension invalidations: grouping invalidating/neutralizing change types
        - causative dimensions: just visualizing higher-impact/causal dimensions
        - vertex dimensions: graphing variables as differences from vertex variables
      - mapping dimensions: group value sets as other structures like points or networks in a space where change types like 'continuous change' are supported
        - embedded dimensions: dimensions graphed visually using extra dimensions as parameters
        - base dimensions: dimensions standardized to a base and graphed in alignment, like multiple functions on a graph with a common base
        - mapping other dimension metadata: interactions between dimensions units/change types/limits/definitions are graphed
        - abstract dimensions: abstract value structures are graphed ('a point on a line') instead of specific values in a dimension
        - constant dimensions: adjacent limiting constant dimensions are graphed instead of dimensions of change
      - dimension interactions: 
        - interactive dimensions: dimensions that interact are condensed into an input/output of the interaction structure, and input/output dimensions are graphed instead
        - dimension interaction structures: structures of interactions between variables (like direction/circuits/networks) are preserved, where values may be lost
          - dimensional difference: difference between dimensions is graphed instead of different dimensions & values, where dimension values are structures associated with graphed dimension interactions
          - conversion requirements: conversion requirements to a visualizable shape are graphed instead of actual dimensions/values
          - interaction structures between value structures like positions on dimensions when graphed as a standardized shape
            - example: with dimensions formatted as a standardized form like 'lines of equal length, & values as points on these lines', the interaction structure would be the lines connecting the points on the dimension lines, when arranged in any order

    - proof/determination structures
        - what makes something possible to identify/calculate
          - a solution structure where the solution metric is clearly defined (structural or having other structures of certainty like consistency or inevitability or requirement)
            - checking a path to see if it includes a node twice is clearly defined (it uses the structure of 'node visit counts' in the 'path' solution structure)
        - what makes something difficult to prove
          - where there are ambiguities (lack of certainty/structure/definition) between the input parameters & the output function value
            - ambiguities such as where multiple inputs produce the same output, like how different x-values can produce the same y value on a wave function
        - useful proof structures
          - apply possible components to create an absolute or scalable definition include components framed in terms of interactions with other components that can be used with a consistent measurement (like a stable structure across interfaces or dimension sets) & can also scale (boundaries), rather than framing them in terms that can have different meanings at different parameters (closed, hollow)
