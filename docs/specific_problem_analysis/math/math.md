  - questions that a computer may not be able to answer even with unlimited memory/computation capacity, without trial & error or other memory-based approach (simply storing methods that worked & incrementally building on that info) to determine system analysis methods
    - what calculations will prove to be optimal (faster/more accurate), before or during processing

  - find meta-math structure: 
    - which would allow/incentivize/generate the changes in info functions/variables (change types: interaction, aggregation, structure-filling, gaps, convergence, similarities) of known math operations
    - is it a metric like efficient stability that allows info to develop into a measurable structure in the first place (possibly changeable interaction), or is it enforced by a system of a set of limits forcing info to interact those ways (definitively inevitable interaction)
    - 'the information amount/type/variance stored in this definition/structure can only take form in or interact with these other structures/to these degrees/in these spaces/on these interaction levels'
      - information = certainty = definition = structure
      - 'this certainty/structure can only interact with or be formatted in these certainties/structures'
      - can you calculate the set of math relationships more quickly by examining opposing structures of uncertainty/randomness, by applying operations to existing certainties, or by finding a common differentiating standard in between, like abstraction'

- math (information-probability interaction) metadata

  - whats the reason for number relationships (numbers being a definition of value, math having a set of relationships between values)
    - can one number have a limited number of properties before its overloaded - whats the reason properties are distributed across intervals & sequences of numbers
    - is it so awareness of a particular number gives you adjacent numbers near it that together cover a wide range of number properties, so the rest can be derived?
    - are there intervals of numbers that are property dense or sparse?
    - are properties denser in numbers that are more measurable or calculatable?
    - do properties have similarities (type), symmetries (function & series), coordinations (orthogonality & area measure), & efficiencies (translating to a space with computations reduced or embedded) that mean they'll accrue into particular property sets more than other property sets?
    - which properties are never observed together (which numbers cant be combined in any space)?
    - which properties could be changed without changing the net or general behavior of the system?
    - what is the full set of possible difference or change types (generated with components of difference & change), and is there a gap in descriptions for them? (usable as a filter)
    - what type of information is not structurable?

  - with information representing the constant vertices of a system, by representing information a certain way, efficiencies are gained in other information, like related calculation outputs 

      - what does the efficiency provide to uncertain/uncalculatable objects external to information?
      - with certain concepts as priorities or embedded in the structure (like orthogonality generating intersection spaces for mapping interactions), certain efficiencies in calculations are created
      - what filter set or subset of possible concepts can explain the information description system?
        - what other objects are explanatory, in addition to concepts (a slice of a system with a similar object or pattern), filters, core/generative functions, limits?
      - what connects the constants in this system, representing information behavior descriptions - are there system objects like validation/formatting filters, efficiencies aligning between information & uncertainty objects, or other objects beyond the conceptual layer of discoverable information systems?
      - given that information attracts information differently in different structures, what intents can those structures & the information rules be used for?
      - if paradoxes are representable as holes in logical value connections (gaps or jumps in the information system, like asymptotes are for values), what type of information values can occupy those holes, or do they act like a symmetry to connect different spaces?

      - does information withdraw into a superposition (structure with multiple potential information states) or an abstract generalization (generative structure of information or concept network trajectory of the information) or a compression (retaining some attributes of the information), once you remove its structure or remove it from a space where it can stabilize enough to attain a structure?

  - what happens when you stress information (injecting change/difference variables, adding assumptions, using it as a dependency)?
      - it vibrates under stress, and breaks into objects of potential (like a superposition), objects of change (adds a variance/expands in dimension, crosses a phase shift threshold)
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space#/media/File:Standing_waves_on_a_string.gif
      - what makes it stabilize into measurable values?
        - common assumptions, intents, efficiencies, matching structures (coordinations)

  - guaranteed information (like a connection/interaction) acts as an interface (foundation for change), allowing other information to aggregate on the foundation of the guaranteed information, limited by the scope of the guarantee (it can only develop change on variables that wont invalidate the guaranteed information, exceed its scope/ability to handle randomness)
    - entanglements develop around symmetries, symmetries attract other symmetries (leading to interaction layer filled with symmetries, all regulating each other, producing randomness)
    - information is converted into potential as randomness

  - to do: test 'path integral' concept for space-time positioning to identify path types (incentivized, adjacent, etc) once various interfaces are applied
  
  - problem types

    - missing concept
    - incomplete structure (combination, sequence)
    - causal structure mismatch
    - incorrect definition route

    - irreversibilities
      - change type traps (certain change types prevent changes of another type, like change toward a minimum may prevent change toward a maximum if gravitational forces apply to incentivize down directions, and the descent has progressed beyond a threshold indicating where the incentives are not desconstructable with resources like information & change types available at the minimum)
        - these can be identified as dead-ends when traversing an interface
  
    - radiation: fractal/cascading/distributed randomness across interfaces (systems & structures) - as opposed to concentrated randomness in a black hole

    - examine whether imaginary numbers are a structure of uncertainty (bc of structural unverifiability), producing reversals of info with application of self-similarity (like time reversals) when interacting with other systems like physics

  - gauge theory definition: field where the difference in kinetic & potential energy doesnt change locally from a symmetry in the form of certain continuous (differentiable) sets with multiplication/division operations
    - find interface boundaries by how its definition & structures break down
    - find gaps in interfaces by points of variation not covered by other interfaces
