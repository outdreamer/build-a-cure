- regarding a math problem-solving function such as:
    - 'Invariance under linear combinations / convex combinations / algebraic operations -> suffices to check basis elements / extreme elements / generators'

    - to solve the problem of:
        - 'how to determine whether a different permutation from applying a particular operation (linear combination) of the same type (linear combination) returns the same type'
    - this is basically a way of finding out information about a 'set of numbers changed using a particular function' by calculating an attribute of a 'number in the set'

- if you know information like the following, other information will be useful to calculate that
    
    - finding out any of the following: 
        - having info like 'number type of inputs' and wanting to find out 'number type of outputs after applying some operation like addition'
        - whether 'addition' operations can change some input data/number/other type
	    - 'whether there are interface structures like symmetries in the problem space that the input (linear) occupies regarding other interface structures like core functions such as addition, such as symmetries between input/output types'
    
    - requires information such as interface queries like:
	    - whether the input or operation applied can be simplified (multiplication can be simplified to a sub-component such as addition, so the 'linear combination' operation is 'addition of added values that only create constant change rates')
	    - what is the opposite (non-linear) of the input type (linear): 
	        - how to differentiate between them (sorting all inputs into the linear or non-linear class using some rule, and whether that rule indicates a connection traversible with addition)
	        - how to connect the opposite (non-linear) of the input and the input (linear) using that particular operation (addition)
	            - structures like 'limited range functions' when added in a linear combination can create a non-linear function
	            - can the opposite (non-linear) be created from the input (linear) using this structure without violating definitions
	                - 'limiting the range' is a violation of the definition
	            - are there alternatives to break the linear type using that operation or is it by definition impossible, given that one option has been filtered out
	    - whether addition has the functionality allowed within the range of its definition to alter the data type of input (linear function)
	        - whether the attributes related to addition like commutativity/transmutivity hold in all cases or if there are exceptions
	            - whether these attributes emerge from the definition or form it
	        - whether operations that can be constructed with addition have other attributes that can extend the functional range of addition to achieve other change types
	        - whether the definition of addition in a different space or with different inputs has other attributes
	            - whether converting example functions to another space (like a space with different bases) changes the relevant attributes of input/output data types or operations
	        - whether the definition of addition can sustain a change that doesnt violate existing definitions but supports a breaking of the input type (linear function)

    - these inputs (linear functions, addition) and the output information (all of the possible structures that a linear combination of a linear combination can take) are connected by relatively few interface structures
        - filtering the possible intents that could violate the sought structure of a symmetry by breaking the linear definition (converting the linear function into its opposite)
        - finding any way to fulfill the intent of building that breaking structure (linear functions of limited range to create non-linearity)
        - checking whether this way breaks the definition of a linear function or whether its allowed by that definition

    - this is a relatively high ratio of output information to input information required to find that output information
        - similar to how finding the average of a point set produces a high ratio of information gained by information input, or inputting params into an elliptic curve function produces a high ratio of information, the ability to use inference rules like 'type-breaking rules' or 'type-maintenance rules' to find other information offers a high input to output information ratio, making these functions useful for various intents

    - designing this type of solution from another perspective, the idea of finding the following seems possible to find automatically, by comparing these high variation functions with the attributes they calculate by similar interface queries (such as the interface query to find that 'linear functions' are the output data type resulting from 'addition applied to linear functions' which results from the interface query of finding the core component 'addition', the 'possible variations that could break the input data type', and 'whether these are possible with addition', which applies simple interface structures as filters in a useful sequence like 'core components (addition)', 'attributes of core components (additivity)', 'opposites (to test for symmetry breaking)', 'definition-breaking change types')
        - 'lattices of operations (like "addition on linear combinations") that are change-invariant on some input attribute where the non-lattice points represent violations of the invariance'
        - 'topologies of math structure attributes making finding structures supporting various attributes trivial'
        - 'information that would be useful to connect to some input that is likely to be related to that input by some relatively simple structure like a boundary of math limit rules'

    - asking questions like the following are useful in finding these useful problems to solve
        - what structures are applied when solving a problem, as interim structures to connect the problem/solution
            - what does the graph of the set of linearly connectible functions look like
        - can these interim problem-solving structures be generated from the problem definition/solution requirements
            - does this linearly connectible function graph serve any useful purpose (like 'find limits of the operation applied to these inputs') related to solving the 'input/output data type matching of linear functions' problem that can be calculated from its intent and implemented adjacently using interface queries with a small search space
        - are there other questions than the obvious problem question that are more useful to solve
            - is there an alternate question like 'can addition create a structure adjacent to non-linear functions, if not a non-linear function itself' which is more solvable and which can be derived from this problem question
                 - this question would produce possibly useful structures like a 'map of overlapping operation networks, where there is some operation in between non-linear-creating and linear-creating operations that can be used as an input to the question of "can addition be usefu to generate some interim structure adjacent to non-linear functions"'
            - are there overlaps/gaps in definitions that could be useful to apply as possibly more solvable variants of the original problem
                - do we know all of the number types in between the number types used as coefficients in these functions which could be more solvable cases, and is that a useful problem to solve for other problems
        - are there useful perspectives to apply when connecting these structures
            - is a 'information/variation function' a more useful perspective to apply to these functions than a 'value-mapping function' or a 'attribute-maintening function'
            - is there a format of this problem that converts it to a problem of finding local minimums/maximums with known functions, like by mapping the 'linear/addition' structures to a 'variation-creation' structure and finding the maximum of this variation-creating function and whether that maximum allows for converting the input linear function to a non-linear function or obeys some limiting boundary of change type/degree
