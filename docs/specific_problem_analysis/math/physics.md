# physics 

    - physics determines probability (of interactions), math describes certainty (of interactions)
      - map physics/math with structural connections like:
        - truth: organization, efficiency, stability, power to act as a foundation/filter, opposite of randomness 
        - power: energy
        - variation: structural interactivity, lack of limits/constants
        - time: lack of constants preventing change, lack of structure-invalidating conditions, difference between constants & interaction potential of structures

    - alternatives
      - a limit on potential energy in the universe, concentrated in space-time moves or symmetry violations, where all other changes align with the standard model
      
    - examine muons as a reflective surface or temporary boundary for electrons to use to avoid violating symmetry, where artificial experiment conditions or other muons can interfere with planned reflection, leading to an imbalance in particle ratios that would occur with distributed/isolated particle pairs

  - physics vertexes
    - potential energy collapses, cascades, & aggregates into structural information (like numbers) on efficiencies, in a way that maximizes difference
      - an example of a cross-interface insight
      - symmetries are an input of interchangeability, such as two functions that can be transformed into the other that perform a similar computation, creating an efficiency (if you have one function in the symmetry, you can generate another, in case the first function doesnt compute what or how you need it to)
    - black hole unpacking function (allows information to develop)
    - universe overlap/collision/combination
    - lack of universe-preventing conditions (like how information can develop if black holes are far enough away) or potential to avoid destruction mechanisms
    - variance injections & interaction rules allowing variance cascades to prop up a universe structure, allowing time to develop
    - upward arc on a wave or parabola (development of time marks the upward arc), where the downward arc is the unraveling of time back to the origin big bang (collapse into a black hole, eject variance, rebound universe), as material or structure allowing material of the universe is stretched temporarily to hold the variance injected via the entry point (whether black hole, universe collision, or something else)
      - what other types of universe are there, other than a universe allowing sequence between states (conditional/temporary truth) achieving/executing absolute truths?
        - other structures include:
          - similar rules but different origin position, different rules (including most extremely different rule set) but similar origin position, & other permutations of universe constants/rules & generative structures like filters/containing sets
            - universe defined as a set of possible trajectories from the various different generative structures, or a space between the various different limiting structures
          - state circuits/networks (illusion of time, but still on the same circuit/network, meaning the states are pre-determined in that theyre guaranteed to be on the circuit/network)
          - a universe of vertexes (generators/determinators/descriptors of other variables, like a set of constants such as identities of nodes on the abstract network), where the primary function is preventing change or routing changes to universes with the potential handlers to contain it in a stable way
            - a universe with a 'regulation' intent that prevents excess change from other universes
          - a universe with different fundamental definitions/dimensions of change/core components/interfaces
            - a universe that builds its foundation off of a different interface than the structural interface
            - a universe with a different definition of information/randomness/position/change
            - a universe with different dimensions of change than position/time/structure
          - universe with potential to switch off time with sub-interface alignment (coordinating changes on quantum interface like with a quantum chain reaction to prevent or reset variance)
          - universe with potential for extreme information states
            - at one extreme, truth can crystallize into a universe-determining input rule if not prevented from doing so, and at the other extreme, structures allowing guaranteed variance to develop first can prevent truth from developing at all
            - universe where information (stable states) is not allowed to develop (a universe requiring distributed randomness, or lack of information), and measurable information is an abstract concept that the universe structure can never create a sub-structure to contain
              - where every possibility is equally likely, invalidating the concept of probability
            - universe where noise/randomness is an intent rather than a side effect of intent alignment & development, so reversing the intent development process to be an input rather than the output of interaction rules allows certain types of information & randomness to develop
            - universe where the ratio & types of information/time allowed to develop allows/prevents certain types of information derivation about universe manipulation/traversal, which if combined with other types from adjacent universes on a certain definition of distance, would invalidate origin or other types of universes
          - universe where potential (in the form of variance injection points) is evenly distributed as a constant condition, so certainty cant develop (in any form, including time/structure/priority)
          - universe where some calculation types are conditionally/contextually possible, like at regular intervals where variance drops below a certain level because of passing adjacent universes
          - universe where information derivation-loss ratio makes calculations irrelevant because of the symmetry types present, which make info loss from info asymmetries trivial (where symmetries can be combined to offset every asymmetry)
          - universe where efficiencies develop in a way that certain priorities are incentivized despite universal constants exerting limits on direction change
            - prioritizing similarity or optimization contradicting a universe constant ratio of variance
            - prioritizing calculation types that prevent measuring information of a particular type
          - universe that involves trajectories between bases as a way to measure change (a changing interface network vs. change on an interface network)
          - universe where external universes are determining, rather than internal states or generative rules
            - coordinating rules in universe development have compounding effects on potential of universe interactions
            - universes where the generative rules, other constants/metrics, and position with respect to other universes are changeable from inside/outside (input/output sides, reversing causation)
          - the influence of one universe on another implies a notion of universe-external time (if a state change occurs, time has passed, even if the state is a change to the set of generative rules), where in reality, the universe relationships might not change (a static game), unless it's possible to coordinate/hook up their dimensions to influence each other
            - but this type of time may not exist, or may only exist conditionally when two universes interact, which doesnt change the absolute rules governing their interactions because the change stabilizes reliably enough to invalidate the idea of change of that type, so universe-external time can only exist in universe-to-universe interactions, but not in universe-to-universe relationship interactions
          - universe where time (in the form of potential or energy) is possible while the universe is being used for calculations, but decays & disperses when not being used, potentially being stored as variance in adjacent universes while not being used
          - universe where time is determined by calculation potential 
            - if something can be calculated from something else & vice versa (independent variables generating a dependent variable), time has not passed while that relationship is true
            - if something cannot be calculated from something else (asymmetry or information loss), time has passed
            - the set of time-independent calculation relationships may determine the amount of time a universe has until it either decays, compresses, changes its determining factors, or finishes its original intended calculation
          - time defined as the potential to calculate trajectories around a universe's singularities, or the ability to arrange calculations in a way that doesnt make all information calculatable
    - calculation trajectory (calculations possible in this universe or space-time used to calculate position in regard to the others, given intents possible with those calculations
      - calculating position (knowing if your space-time is a pawn/knight & the pawn/knight functions, and deriving the existence of other positions) & possible intents of that position (& the ensuing functionality) enables determining the set of possible moves on the board, the limits of the board, the point of the game, and the optimal positions/moves/states in the game, giving you a direction to move in if you can coordinate with other players
        - derive information with rules like:
          - if there is a universe that can destroy yours when adjacent, you know that its not adjacent to you
            - similarly, if there is another pair/set of destroying universes when in certain positions that are related to your universe (inputs/outputs/alternatives of yours, or cooperating with yours), you know theyre not in those positions
          - if there are rules that are invalidating to particular types of potential/information/randomness/change that have been measured or determined to be valid in some measured or possible context, you know those rules are not absolute

    - structure-information interface:
      entanglement, as the accretion of possible information into a core function (information generator, like the physical component of an assumption - a defined relationship, with its own definition of difference (reducing distance type of difference between entangled particle positions)
      polarity, as the accretion of information into a core function
      wave-function collapse, as the angle at which information appears to have one dimension of change

  - ways to navigate space-time
    - alternate routes to arrange spacetimes in a way that makes origin & target space-times adjacent or traversible
    - navigating by symmetries as a guide to reversible routes through space-times; where theres a window of opportunity to reverse trajectory (on a space-time tree branch ending with a dead-end leaf) if a structure of symmetries like a foundation or net or symmetry-generating structure is within reach

  - example of how the physics system has structures preventing certain cascading change types (local scope bubbling) & allowing others (nuclear chain reactions), partially through forces like gravity keeping objects at a distance: https://www.sciencealert.com/time-travel-through-a-quantum-world-has-nothing-to-fear-from-the-butterfly-effect
  
  - when physics rules stabilize, they attract & generate information, which gathers into measurable numbers
    - if the point of the universe is not to find the initial filters but to prevent that information from being discovered, that could keep open options for other change sources

  - an infinite series implies a stabilized symmetry (a platform for change that goes on forever) - clearly there are different degrees of stability - how do these different degrees of stability relate to different infinities like infinite sets given by number groups
    - the chain of events mentioned here implies a stability in the energy preservation with each successive event
      - https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-goes-on-in-a-proton-quark-math-still-conflicts-with-experiments-20200506/

  - type of chart: a map of the trajectory between low-to-high dimensional representations of a function

  - what attributes determine symmetries so you could differentiate between symmetries (distortion functions, origin)

  - each superposition contains components representing different possible filters for the physical laws they create at scale
    - some superpositions collapse into a particular attribute set
    - superpositions with different configurations may represent other interface queries or structures
    - knowing the internal structure of a superposition would mean we get to choose which queries come to life & become real
    - the design implies we shouldnt get to choose - but external forces (or unmeasurable/uncomputable forces inside the universe) should get to determine which configurations collapse & which differences are allowed
    - information has a lifecycle - its likelier to become more true the more its observed, up to a maximum - then it's likelier to erode as its depended on
    - observing a state (to produce the information of the observation) may initialize the static nature of that information, so other observers see either static information or lack of it depending on their perspective, as information becomes truer the more its observed, and they may focus on the lack of information or a different perspective than the initial state of the information

  - time may be a variance gap (a space where change is possible) to resolve a question/problem set - so not resolving it can preserve time, unless resolving it will allow for more potential or moving on to other variance gaps


# Quantum physics

  - processes with time irreversibility:
    - allow a state change within a symmetry's transformation space, without passing time (no change has occurred except law obedience) - a unit of required order
    - guarantees distribution of resources (energy)
    - guarantees destructibility of intelligent energy-hoarding systems (biological life)
    - prevents some powerful energy sources from being accidentally created by intelligent energy-hoarding systems (black holes)
    - allows for variance cascades
    - information increases potential for reversibility, so irreversible processes probably destroy information or evade information (never converge to measurability through alternatives)

  - independence (closed trade loops) as time storage

  - entanglement occurring from:
    - rotating around a symmetry
    - finding nearest unused/unentangled particle
    - same interface network query (same position in a system)

  - finding how to reverse historical filters (great filter) could reverse the initial filter, or create same starting conditions to go in a different direction, looping around to initial filter
  
  - examine a universe without differentiation (every particle containing universe has the same starting resource point & limits)

  - examine when randomness can masquerade as entanglement due to limited options of core function interactions due to the system development being in an initial phase

  - information organized by relevance & efficiency

  - useful for computing attribute & variance flow as well as flow between flow of energy into measurement delivery 
    (optimize energy distribution between particle position/spin attributes according to measurement limits)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation

  - look for new objects in inter-system physics - as an object occupies a current & target system as well as the space in between that isnt classifiable
    - what physics apply between systems (space-times here)
      https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/white-dwarf-causes-strange-relativity-effect-called-frame-dragging/

  - examine how info is being destroyed in black holes & in quantum physics - is this a process that can be used for encryption or is the info irretrievable?

  - scale transitions

      - give example of emergent effects of phase/scale transitions across threshold values that exert more variance than systems can hold

      - quantum scale transitions as delegation of information to optimal/efficient/low-energy positions
        - appears to be in multiple positions until it determines which position is more efficient or easier to maintain
      
  - quantum => info => energy dissipation:
    - when quantum superposition resolves into information, which resolves into efficiency & energy, how does it cycle back into enabling additional variance (more quantum uncertainties)
    - theres an element of dimensional collapse/compression/removal involved in these processes, releasing the variance from the structures that store it
    - the dimensions of potential in a superposition collapse into information about particle attributes
    - the dimensions of information collapse into energy, which can collapse into efficiency (path of least resistance that achieves an intent) if combined with enough other efficiency pathways
    - examine the pattern of high dimensional objects appearing to have lower dimensions at various points of measurement
      - this is similar to alternate paths producing the same output from the same input
      - as variance flows into various dimension sets, the overlap of output with other dimension sets is less likely but not impossible & may occur at predictable intervals,
        like how integers have more limiting attributes than numbers in between, so boundary physics applies to integers & they can act as a filter
    - examine when emerging attributes cant be contained within a space & leak into others


  - universe as a topology, where points are interface network queries

  - nonlocality is produced by similarities in interface queries, which output similar information (space-times that are linked by similarity)
    - the interface queries formatted as filters producing information allow similar structures to develop, and within those structures, information about the interface filters can be derived (creating an intrinsic link between any space-time produced by that query, given that they can understand their own space-time and infer the existence of similar space-times, putting them in the same observer position)
      - this information can then be used as a base/foundation for:
        - other information to develop, which may be useful to the other similar space-times (and energy can be allocated based on usage, so the space-times have a connection on this energy sharing (energy formatted as information), and may draw those space-times together as the connection is used more (possibly generating gravity or other forces that would draw them together, or a type of energy connecting the two space-times/information bits output by the query)
        - accessing other information, like the output of other adjacent interface queries, where the base acts like the first rung of a ladder
      - the sequence of information formats to get from the first rung to a higher position depends on whether adjacent space-times can be used to infer unknown interfaces not-derivable with the interface query of the origin space-time
      - can they get to another interface with a limit set (calculation limit), a calculation set (lossy algorithm), an information set (encrypted information, quantum information), randomness (lack of information) injections?
      - what efficient paths (wormholes) are allowed within a topology of space-times (with their limits, uncertainties, calculations, symmetries, etc)?
      - can a universe be converted to a boundary (pushed past threshold, breaking the balance between the universe & the boundary) & injected with randomness to use as a filter for information to get to other universe
      - can a universe be condensed/broken/formatted to be able to slip through the boundary (does the boundary need an input like energy, does its existence depend on the universe, does it have unenforced rules)
        - can energy be transmitted through the universe boundary
      - what happens to a universe or space-time with information removed, either by radiation or another method?

      - structure is aggregated information/certainty, which implies that if a structure exists, it can be calculated
      - structures can contain uncertainties if the space in the structure is not enforced enough (isnt filled with structures)
      - information (structure) is an energy format
      - in order for information to exist, there has to be structure (structure can be equated with information)
      - structures capable of holding information can exert an attractive force on that information (if it's imminent or exists in an adjacent structure & is looking for a way to preserve state)
        - what structures can hold the information of physics questions like how to:
          - connect space-times
          - preserve information in black holes
          - break a universe boundary (as mentioned here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end-20201029/)

        - this means that in order to hold/attract/preserve/calculate different types of information, you can generate new structures to hold the information you need (like a space-time sequence with uncertainties aligned to allow a certain energy/information type to develop)

      - in order for time to exist, there has to be other possible states (change has to be possible)
      - in order for space-times to be connectable, there has to be potential (a chain of uncertainties in the host system structure, in which a wormhole or connecting/attracting force or energy type can form)
        - which uncertainties, when positioned adjacently, can create a structure in which information possible in one space-time can be communicated to another?
          - uncertainties can be captured on interfaces and formatted as filters with unenforced rules
            - a sequence of space-times with coordinating uncertainties for a 'connection' intent may operate by linking uncertainty inputs/outputs in the sequence
              - which space-times would have these coordinating sequences in the same position that can align across space-times?

      - can a symmetry be injected into or generated in a system cascading irreversibly toward maximal entropy, without integrating it with another system?
        - can you break information in the system by overloading it (using it as a foundational interface out of scope so it cant hold all the information allocated to it)
        - can you break an irreversibility by integrating it with another irreversibility in the system
        - can you generate randomness from within a closed/isolated high/maximal entropy system

      - entropy can only be really measured once a system is used to calculate a known quantity to test if the system actually offers certainty, and this full calculation of entropy can never be totally measured (tested in all possible systems/states for all possible calculations in all possible structures like sequences)
        - for instance, when a space-time splits bc an uncertainty develops & two outcomes (microstates) occur simultaneously, resulting in an extra macrostate (multiple/both/either)
        - or when the system is about to lose the ability to capture the concept of 'sequence' or a change type or information about a previous value in the microstate in its structure (bc the states/usage interacted in a way that disrupted the system), in which case the microstates can not describe the system anymore
        
        - for instance, if two microstates being adjacent creates a higher probability of either occurring, or if different microstates exert an attractive force, or if microstates can combine or merge to create new microstates or interact similarly with macrostates
          
          - example: 'same', 'reversed', 'different' macrostates of a two-try coin flip microstate have different relationships (such as similarity) to each other
            
            - can state aggregate or be injected into a stateless process (information injection to the first or second flip, like probability or adjacent microstates)
              - for example, given the relative unlikelihood of equivalent states occurring in a sequence compared to different states occurring in a sequence, are differences, corrupted information, or uncertainties likelier to stabilize, or increase/compound/generate new differences?
              
              - can the events, probabilities (of states, probability distributions, conditional/independent probabilities, system equilibrium/lack of change), states influence the position (first, second), structure (sequence), or type (up/down) variables? 
                - do the symmetries between similar states (same, different, reversed) offer any influence on other symmetries (change types/range of other system params)
                  - is the system of symmetries also approaching maximum entropy if the host system is doing so?

            - randomness types, connections, sources: 
                
                - does randomness of each toss depend on lack of structure changing/aggregating through interactions of these parameters? 
                  - if randomness depends on that, randomness is not just an input, its also an output (of the condition that the system does not change)
                
                - can randomness be generated another way (using different metadata), and how does that randomness interact with the input randomness of possible outcomes of each flip
                  - how can structure be removed to reduce information (creating possible source of randomness)? 
                    - are the inputs to probability subject to randomness injection?
                    - randomness injection probabilities for metadata:
                      - objects: event
                      - inputs:
                        - states: outcome sequence, outcome sequence equivalence
                        - structures: symmetry, equivalence
                        - params: velocity, number of rotations, angle (highest probability of a randomness injection is here)
                        - interaction between probability types, structures, & bases

                      - interacting (aggregate) probabilities of states
                        - after getting tails in the first flip, the probability of tails in the next flip is still 50%
                        - the probability of a same outcome vs. a different outcome overall (macrostate) is 50% for a different type of equivalencee (50% for T-H & H-T and 50% for T-T & H-H)

            - can you equate one state (different) with a structure of another (same combined with reversed)
            - is the system capable of having its information corrupted (like if time parameter is removed), so information from different states may merge or otherwise change
            - does probability have physics favoring changes to a distribution in a vacuum?

            - probability types
              - probability trajectories across states
                - examine interaction of probabilities of states/outcomes at different times (before first toss, before second toss)
              - minimum tosses to measure probability of states/outcomes & other metadata like symmetries
              - emerging states at different scopes (superstates & atomic states)
              - emerging probability during flip as a function of motion trajectories (velocity, number of rotations, time)
                - what is the interaction space of different value sets of these parameters, and what probabilities are they associated with?
