# physics

    - examine deriving 'protein' & 'gene' & 'activation state' as the location, components, input & structure of functionality

    - examine association of energy production, mitochondria & ribosomes, with stressors/metabolism & immune exhaustion

    - what is the connection between entropy (which Ive been using 'variance', 'potential', 'uncertainty' in place of at various points) and temporary information (information that is temporarily true, like electron position, rather than conditionally true, like laws of physics which apply in universe contexts and at certain scales, or absolutely true, like rules governing quantum & standard physics interactions)
      - are black holes related to the output of accurate natural 'clocks' that formed
      - higher distribution of energy leads to higher entropy (possible states), but also a higher number of possible info interactions (which produce at least temporary certainties)
      - what is the relationship between entropy as 'possible' information, & 'probable' information
      - which of these possible states can be filtered out, either by probability, energy efficiency/stability, state connections, or other rules (how to add info of varying parameters to high entropy systems)
      - how to build a clock with consensus aggregated from various info sources that feed off each other in an input/output cycle
      - isolated systems are more useful for timekeeping
      - if the 'flow of time' is 'lack of organization', can 'organization' condense or connect or reverse time
      - if time is potential (ability to change), it is created by organizing info as a side effect in the form of entropy
      - whereas if time is lack of potential (certainty acquired as info, and entropy generated from it), there is a finite amount of it
      - if time is a system involving both info (lack of potential) & the entropy/potential generated from it, such as a ratio required to maintain for both to continue to exist
      - whether the ratio points to a convergence of one superceding the other is an open question
      - what is the connection between related concepts: 'randomness' as 'lack of info', 'potential' as 'ability to change', 'variance' as 'change injection points', 'uncertainty' as 'lack of certainty structures (like identifying/differentiating/determining/describing variables)', 'info' as 'specific stable connections, with varying time/scale/condition/position/state of applicability', 'entropy' as 'number of possibilities', 'possibility' as 'structure that isnt ruled out by other structures', 'energy' as 'change trigger/input, which can be stored/organized/formatted as info/potential', 'accuracy' as 'correct info measurement or info prediction/generation/finding function', structures like 'similarity/efficiency' as 'info inputs (which make it likelier that something will be proven true)'

    - what junk dna could be added that would enable production of the most useful types of RNA/proteins & other components for immune system functions, repair processes, & other anti-illness processes

    - https://www.quantamagazine.org/mental-phenomena-dont-map-into-the-brain-as-expected-20210824/

      - why memory sections might not always be necessary
        - bc complex memory structures might only be necessary to represent complex sensory structures like overlaps/ambiguities, or necessary to represent chromological/sequential structures

      - why might functions not be mappable to isolatable brain regions
        - bc they should be broken down or combined into other functions (general, interim, common, interchangeable, core, etc) than those on the interaction level theyre examining

      - why might movement info be stored instead of sensory info:
        - bc movement is a proxy variable of sensory info reactions

      - why might metabolic regulation & memory formation be connected:
        - relation to available energy used for forming memories (excess energy is prioritized for tasks like memory)
        - relation to rewards for using energy a particular way such as in forming memories
        - relation to regulatory schedule linked to sleep cycle & memory formation during sleep
        - distortions in metabolic function are prioritized in memory formation

    - "In the developing immune system, double-stranded breaks enable pieces of DNA to recombine and generate a diverse repertoire of antibodies"
      - examine how states that trigger useful functions like stem cell production or antibody production can be triggered

    - explore how much functionality can be developed by using incentives
      - if you create rewards like dopamine when a dysfunctional cell process is triggered or replicated artificially, does the system re-build or correct or re-learn that functionality
        - like when cholesterol prevents immune system from reacting to cell death, can you force the immune system to re-learn its original reactions, forcing it to react to cell death by associating that reaction with rewards or some other trigger like inflammation/pain that would correct its dysfunctional state?
        - if not, can you apply a change in the opposite direction (triggers of an 'over-reaction' error type to cell death, but only enough to move it back toward its original state)

    - check how much of the 'bio interactions' with a 'rules database' is available, to predict missing interactions from the rules database
      - this could be used to predict which combinations of structures (states like genetic mutations, bio system & cancer states, attributes like acidity, components like microbes/enzymes, functions like inhibitors, inputs like energy sources) will switch off cell proliferation processes & which will have the opposite effect
        - this should be able to identify when the immune system will hinder treatment, when oxygen deprivation will be an enabler of a disease, when pathogens will be synergistic/antagonistic, etc
        - it should also be able to identify which states are adjacent/accessible that the system can be converted to, which would have beneficial effects like 'neutralizing negative effects as defined in a particular state' 
          - conversions such as 'find a awy to standardize neoantigens so theyre similar to neoantigens targeted by an existing treatment' or 'find a way to standardize tumors/immune cells by giving them inputs that will trigger a state sequence that produces a more standard or more treatable tumor' or 'find a way to make tumors seem more like pathogens already defended in memory cells' or 'engineer microbes that feed off cancer cells and then travel to the gut or eat each other or are eaten by other microbes/enzymes' or 'find neurons that map to nerves around the tumor and stimulate those neurons' bc standardization takes the risk & the work out of applying immunotherapies & other customized medicine
          - standardizing immune cells could help reduce variation in immune responses to treatments: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-09-vaccine.html

    - autoantibodies as possible reaction to 'not having any actual pathogens to attack so they start attacking the immune system components which are just nearby or easier to attack than pathogens or have structural damage that disrupts their immune functionality' 
    - what alternate inputs have the outputs of useful structures that have antitumor or antimicrobial activity
      - what can produce components (enzymes/antibodies/t-cells), functions, or attribute states that eat cancer cells ('adapting to mct oil')
      - what combinations of structures are particular useful in general or specifically against a particular pathogen/condition
    - what other pathogens/conditions are synergistic with other conditions (do specific fungal/bacterial infections help cancer, and which ones if its a specific set)
    - what is required to make the body 'allergic' to a substance like a cell membrane attribute of specific cancer cell types 
      - is this the same as a normal immune response
      - is it similar at all to a 'pain' response alerting the immune system to a problem, and what can produce a 'pain' response if that response is useful
      - what other attributes could cancer cells have that make certain compounds likelier to bind to them or surround them to cut them off from energy sources or separate the tumor into attackable pieces (surface structures, attributes in various solutions like fat/water/mucus/blood, response to enzymes/pathogens)
      - what ratios (stress, acidity/alkalinity, enzyme ratios, energy ratios, cell distribution ratios, blood waste ratios, kidney/liver/pancreas/digestion function ratios, immune cell ratios) and other structures are associated with cancer progression/triggering
        - what ratios do some anti-cancer foods like almonds have that other foods do not

    - why can many functions be modeled with the heat equation?
      - diffusion by interaction:
        - bc variable interactions tend to occur on the same interfaces or in the same interaction levels/space, meaning variables will likely encounter the outputs of other variables, so when one variable outputs energy, another variable will be impacted by that
      - diffusion by adjacence (in some structural definition of similarity like similarity in position):
        - variable interactions tend to occur between adjacent structures (adjacent in some similarity, like similarity of position or similarity of inputs), meaning any energy outputs/overflows will be inputs to adjacent structures & will change those adjacent structures
        - functions having variables with similar standard inputs/outputs (like a common currency such as 'heat' or 'energy' or 'difference types') will be triggerable by those common inputs if they are also outputs of other functions, and functions frequently use common inputs bc repetition is a commonly useful structure
      - interaction & adjacence have as a consequence 'diffusion by additivity':
        - variables that are similar can likely be added or similarly combined and are likely to have similar inputs, so they are interactive with the initial change in this way as well
      - diffusion by requirement
        - change in a semi-closed or closed system has to go somewhere, because very few functions can absorb change forever, so any structures that dont have enforced/protected stability will be changed by a particular change that is not handled by a change structure that diffuses the initial change in a more orderly way than a system-wide change cascade

    - curvature implies momentum of change of a particular type rather than constant change, applying a structure of incentives toward various positions & connections
      - is there a set of 'time crystal' space-times where change could be stuck in a 'local minima' where momentum doesnt reward movement in any direction (are space-time spaces continuous and is a method like momentum applied to determine motion in this space of space-times)
      - time as a 'continuous overlap' of dimensions where change is still possible
        - the change of 'possible change' implies a change in the restrictions on change (its boundaries), like the intersection & overlap of restrictions on change
        - the interaction space of restrictions is a useful structure to determine possible change types (how various definition routes of dimension can interact without invalidating another definition or each other)
        - https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-mathematicians-guided-tour-through-high-dimensions-20210913/
    - examine differences in functionality in cancer cells, like why some cell types dont have the same problems from aging/inflammation/exhaustion that other cells do - is it enabling genetic configuration or other factors?
    - similarities between physics systems and math functions
      - this insight applies an interface query to implement 'finding similar alternatives' to 'replace nodes' in an 'input-output sequence'
        - examine 'inner product space' in relation to correlated universes (a 'similarity function' in the form of quantum entanglements producing an extra higher dimension)
      - the 'infinite tree' produced in the 'bulk space' by switching in p-adic numbers as an 'alternate/interchangeable structure with a similar attribute of holography' possibly has a connection to the 'infinite particle position probability field' structures in the quantum field theory of an 'equilibrium across universes' or 'composite hologram created by the intersection of multiple universes', the 'equilibrium' mapping to some combination of parameters of spaces, dimensions, number types, aggregation functions, similarity/adjacence functions, & other components of the theory that corresponds to a corresponding useful structure on a topography of universes intersections & combinations, where gravity determines adjacence of points on the lower-dimensional space & what information survives, and where 'position probabilities' are scrambled bc theres no 'required enforcement of adjacence' once quantum entanglements form
      - examine the holographic output of 'information' as the temporary past storage of energy used to provide a maximum limit on the entropy of the universe so it cant be completely chaotic
      - 'perfect calculatability', 'information generation', 'de-randomization' (creation of order) tools as 'time-reversal' tools
        - if you can calculate physics perfectly, and you know a past state, you can calculate a state in between the past and current state perfectly, and the 'information of how to get to a state' might as well be equivalent to 'traveling to that past state' bc it makes 're-creating that state' or 'following the trajectory to that state' trivial (adjacent, if not equivalent in position)
      - https://www.quantamagazine.org/one-labs-quest-to-build-space-time-out-of-quantum-particles-20210907/
    - what differentiates a time crystal 'infinite change for no energy' from an electron, which contains energy and maintains it in a stable state, assuming no interference from interactions

  - document time structures (concave time explaining compounding similarities up to a point of maximum concavity, a structure that can separate from the other space-times)

  - time as 'alignment' or 'connectivity' between multiple useful interface structures like 'change types/patterns' & 'connectible stable states'
  
  - time crystals are an example of a 'certainty' structure created by 'requirements'
      - there is no other possibility allowed by the 'interactions of those structures' which create 'requirements', so the behavior of the time crystal is 'inevitable', or 'required'
    - a quantum superposition is a 'lack of information' or 'semi-information' as in a 'lack of efficient stability' (or a mismatch between a structure and the space its observed in vs. the space its clearly defined in, like how imaginary numbers are partially structural in euclidean space in their reference to 1 & square roots and negatives) so that the interaction with the 'observation' function gives the not-information or semi-information of the superposition the efficiency/energy it needs to stabilize, like a template being filled with variable values according to a query, where the template represents 'partial/semi-information' and the values injected into it crystallize it into a more certain form
    - energy transfer from observer to observed in the form of certainty/structure allowing resolution of observed 'lack of structure' (as a variable) into a 'structure' (value)
    - how could you derive that 'light collisions generate matter':
      - core structures of physics interface include:
        - 'light'
        - 'matter'
      - core structures of structure interface include:
        - 'combinations'
      - core structures of system interface include:
        - unit
          - it makes sense that: 
            - 'fundamental structures are created from other fundamental structures'
            - alternatives/contradictions to this include rules like:
              - 'structures that seem fundamental may just be dissipated side effects of more complex object interactions rather than core components of a system'
        - interactivity
          - if 'the universe has boundaries preventing light from being emitted or destroyed in some form (like through black holes or other objects without complete understanding)',
            - it makes sense that 'light combined with interactivity & boundary structures leads to common light interactions, leading to a required handler making the output of light interactions useful'
              - 'light would be forced (required) to frequently interact with itself by being rebounded by universal boundaries'
                - a 'required common interaction' like this would be 'probably useful' in some way, or 'required to be useful' by its commonness
                  - its output, whatever that might be, would have to be handled or the side effects would cascade and cause errors
                  - you could frame 'matter' as an 'error', as in an error in the form of an 'imbalance' between antimatter & matter
      - either of these structures could connect 'light' with 'matter' with different routes

  - structures of 'adjacence' connecting structures of 'stability' as a source of 'certainty' structures that are alternatives to 'default certainty' structures like 'equilibriums'
    - remove 'connection structures' between 'adjacent states' with 'invalidating structures' to 'remove a variable' ('maintain a particular state')
    - possible error structures
      - is energy absorbed/emitted during laser/microwave application, like during traversal of particle sequence
    - alternative structures
      - structures of 'connection' like 'entanglement' are another source of 'stability' & 'certainty' structures
    - questions
      - do numbers represent the most efficient energy storage unit? (any physical structure can be described by any number if distorted enough, which matches the 'any particle can be in any position if moved enough' structure)
      - how would various structures of 'certainty' like 'stability' interact, and how would they interact with structures of 'uncertainty' like 'randomness'?
        - how would two contradicting structures of certainty (like two structures of certainty created from the same or different stability sources) interact - could they coexist in the same interaction space, or would they neutralize each other in some way, or would one structure at motion exert a destructive force on the other, removing its stability or dispersing its components?
        - can they be allowed to be adjacent or do they exert attracting forces, leading to structures of certainties
        - what happens if a structure of uncertainty is trapped inside a structure of certainties?
        - are uncertainties just occupying an adjacent state of matter in an unobservable structure (hidden behind other structures of uncertainty, or unconnectible to space-times where other structures can be measured/observed), like a certainty when above the surface of water and an uncertainty when below it?
          - if efficiencies & other stability structures allow energy to develop into structures above it, do the opposite structures allow energy storage below it (or inside it)?
          - how do quantum fields fit with interfaces? can each field be formatted as an interface, and their intersection is the interface/meaning interface?
            - is each point in the quantum field intersection an entry point to the interface interface or an implementation of it (potential particles)
          - is it a set of dimensions describing change types that is unconnectible to observable dimensions?
          - what are the directions of interaction/causality between interacting fields? how do attributes of each point interact/map/align with those of adjacent & non-adjacent points - is there organization to this mapping? can the fields exist across disconnected layers at each adjacent point, or do they have to be connected/continuous? what rules out position possibilities of a particle other than other particle positions? can all of the particles be measured at once?
          - when one structure 'doesnt exist' (loses structure), does it just move to these spaces involving uncertainty structures (like particles with opposite spin)
          - does there need to be some ratio like a balance maintained between the structures of certainty/uncertainty in these two positions?
          - do 'structures' as we know/measure them only exist in space-time points that are connectible with certainty structures, and between these points, uncertainty structures can develop
            - which of these is more stable? are uncertainty structures by definition less stable, or are they the default that energy always resolves into when left to its own devices, an attribute that is counterintuitive bc it would contradict the definition of uncertainty?
      - given that structures of certainty remove or invalidate time (time cant pass when something is certain), will these structures be capable of removing time in other locations? can time be added in locations/moments as well as removed?
      - will these certainty cascades destroy time necessary to solve other problems?
      - can these certainty structures be directed at uncertainty structures, like sources of randomness/risk/ambiguity/change/potential/energy to make them more certain?
      - can these also function as structures of efficiency and independence?
      - can randomness structures also disconnect/interfere with adjacent space-times?
        - what can connect space-times - can certainty structures connect them or would they do the opposite given that they remove/invalidate time?
      - if you created a barrier of enough time crystals preventing change (the passage of time) in the forward direction, would the backward direction be inevitable?
        - is that direction capable of handling the current energy storage or would it create problems?
      - if you disrupt stability structures like entanglements, absolutes, connections, continuities, inevitabilities, constants, time crystals, equilibriums & symmetries enough, do they disperse into components like energy stores, allowing other versions to form or allowing the adjacence of other previously non-adjacent alternate forms, or do they always disperse into disorder? can you 'skip ahead' to non-adjacent space-times with more information if you use more certainty structures, and does this decrease other useful resources like 'potential energy' & other uncertainty structures, reducing the number of possible paths?
        - are 'fractons' another 'certainty' structure to create 'certain connections in similarities in behavior across separate particles'?
        - is 'antimatter' an uncertainty structure that can only be approximated or theorized but not measured, like true randomness?
        - what else would explain this illusion of uncertainty vs. certainty dichotomy, if its an error?
        - does matter not exist for every possible state between stable space-times? how much can this interval be extended if so, without breaking the matter's probability of re-assembling in the next space-time it reaches stability in?
      - how can reflections & other distortions & structures of light be used to encode info about the original energy?
      - can you create connections between space-times by adding stability or efficiencies between states, so the original trajectory is higher-energy to maintain?
      - can you move structures of space-times like combinations (similar to a ship) to other positions in space-time fabric
        - are there gaps in space-time fabric and can they be crossed or filled with certainty structures
      - do certainty structures map to other interfaces, so that fractons/entanglements map to the logic interface in some structure that is robust to change on that interface, like 'exceptions', 'contradictions' or 'connections between equivalent components of rules' - can they create certainty or just reflect it, and where is it generated from if so?
      - what concepts allow for the existence of 'infinity': complexity, scale, change, interaction (combining these allows for the development of enough changes to allow an infinity to develop)

    - use certainty-identification machine as a certainty-generating machine if it can outpace some physical processes to generate/store/find information
      - quantum physics may be a system that can outpace the info-production/derivation methods of physics, so a certainty machine built on quantum technology could be capable of this, if connected to other quantum certainty machines more efficiently than those built on physics are

    - examine states of matter in wave/circuit structures as sources of time crystals
      - examine if some particles appear to be isolated but the isolation is an illusion and theyre dependent in the sense that theyre reflections of each other or another particle

      - maintaining an uncertainty sequence or an uncertainty pattern/degree at regular intervals can allow for multiple origins to merge or be relevant

      - to explain matter vs. antimatter, need to identify:
        - what structures are missing that would prevent matter from gathering
        - differences in strength & other attributes of mass aggregation vs. dispersion forces
        - what structures would produce patterns of mass aggregation (oscillation alignment, single position of origin particles, adjacence patterns) & output structures (when oscillations of adjacent particles align, what happens) 

  - the theory of 'the universe as a simulation' is only now getting popular bc our brain structures & functions are such that we are only now recognizing the influence of physics on human decisions, noticing that we can influence these decisions, and therefore fake them, which reminds us of computer simulations

    - examine temporary stabilized filter structures in ozone to push co2 out of atmospheric layers away from earth & forces to do that

    - example of aligning & standardizing to interfaces to identify optimal methods to solve a problem:
        - use of non-structural information (randomness, imaginary numbers, & other sources of uncertainty) as an input for intents like 'exploring rules of high-variation structures like energy, info, or space-time'
        - example accidental application of this: https://phys.org/news/2021-03-imaginary-quantum-resource-theory.html
      - examine peak/valley of space-time wave as flow between energy (info) storage/usage types, possibly acting as opposite ends of a spectrum representing a trade-off (on liquidity, direction & other attributes)
      - examine magnetic/gravitational/electrical/other forces determining relationships of space-times
        - forces allowing:
          - non-adjacent & multi-directional space-times to be connected
          - space-times that arent efficient enough to be used as input to be left behind/dissolved rather than crystallized/connected
        - finding structures of lack where forces arent triggered bc there arent particles or other structures of energy there, to allow for uncertainties to develop & be used as input

  - examine subatomic superpositions as such a fast aggregation of time that each possibility is occurring simultaneously
    - if superpositions are a core physical structure of uncertainty, examine whether they can be used as a base for the optimal neural network structure, where core problem types are handled by subatomic particle type structures & other structures relevant to superpositions
    - applications
      - anti-structures: enforced lack of structure to preserve lack of structure development to ensure scale of operations
        - performing calculations in places with less gravity to speed them up and send them back to places with more gravity to get answers relatively quickly
    - questions
      - what combinations of velocity/time/scale produce equal positions/perspectives, and are there stable paths between them
        - what differences in potential emerge in different perspectives (differences in potential like reversibility)
        - how many different perspective types are there, and do they stabilize to a particular perspective in a vacuum
      - which change measurement syncs the best with time progression
      - which metadata (scale) are the best sources of randomness structures found in
      - which structures can store one-directional time (aka information)
        - where info is measurable, leaves signals, and processes are irreversible
        - is there a structure that can permanently store information (unchangeable information)
        - what structures of cause (inevitability, certainty, stability, equivalence) exist at subatomic scales
      - time speed factors: 
        - more interactions have to happen at larger scales
        - fewer things change at large scales
        - there are more randomness injection points at larger scales
        - change-resistance (stability) occurs more at larger scales
        - change measurability varies across scales

    - physics determines probability (of interactions), math describes certainty (of interactions)
      - map physics/math with structural connections like:
        - truth: organization, efficiency, stability, power to act as a foundation/filter, opposite of randomness 
        - power: energy
        - variation: structural interactivity, lack of limits/constants
        - time: lack of constants preventing change, lack of structure-invalidating conditions, difference between constants & interaction potential of structures

    - alternatives
      - a limit on potential energy in the universe, concentrated in space-time moves or symmetry violations, where all other changes align with the standard model
      
    - examine muons as a reflective surface or temporary boundary for electrons to use to avoid violating symmetry, where artificial experiment conditions or other muons can interfere with planned reflection, leading to an imbalance in particle ratios that would occur with distributed/isolated particle pairs

  - physics vertexes
    - potential energy collapses, cascades, & aggregates into structural information (like numbers) on efficiencies, in a way that maximizes difference
      - an example of a cross-interface insight
      - symmetries are an input of interchangeability, such as two functions that can be transformed into the other that perform a similar computation, creating an efficiency (if you have one function in the symmetry, you can generate another, in case the first function doesnt compute what or how you need it to)
    - black hole unpacking function (allows information to develop)
    - universe overlap/collision/combination
    - lack of universe-preventing conditions (like how information can develop if black holes are far enough away) or potential to avoid destruction mechanisms
    - variance injections & interaction rules allowing variance cascades to prop up a universe structure, allowing time to develop
    - upward arc on a wave or parabola (development of time marks the upward arc), where the downward arc is the unraveling of time back to the origin big bang (collapse into a black hole, eject variance, rebound universe), as material or structure allowing material of the universe is stretched temporarily to hold the variance injected via the entry point (whether black hole, universe collision, or something else)
      - what other types of universe are there, other than a universe allowing sequence between states (conditional/temporary truth) achieving/executing absolute truths?
        - other structures include:
          - similar rules but different origin position, different rules (including most extremely different rule set) but similar origin position, & other permutations of universe constants/rules & generative structures like filters/containing sets
            - universe defined as a set of possible trajectories from the various different generative structures, or a space between the various different limiting structures
          - state circuits/networks (illusion of time, but still on the same circuit/network, meaning the states are pre-determined in that theyre guaranteed to be on the circuit/network)
          - a universe of vertexes (generators/determinators/descriptors of other variables, like a set of constants such as identities of nodes on the abstract network), where the primary function is preventing change or routing changes to universes with the potential handlers to contain it in a stable way
            - a universe with a 'regulation' intent that prevents excess change from other universes
          - a universe with different fundamental definitions/dimensions of change/core components/interfaces
            - a universe that builds its foundation off of a different interface than the structural interface
            - a universe with a different definition of information/randomness/position/change
            - a universe with different dimensions of change than position/time/structure
          - universe with potential to switch off time with sub-interface alignment (coordinating changes on quantum interface like with a quantum chain reaction to prevent or reset variance)
          - universe with potential for extreme information states
            - at one extreme, truth can crystallize into a universe-determining input rule if not prevented from doing so, and at the other extreme, structures allowing guaranteed variance to develop first can prevent truth from developing at all
            - universe where information (stable states) is not allowed to develop (a universe requiring distributed randomness, or lack of information), and measurable information is an abstract concept that the universe structure can never create a sub-structure to contain
              - where every possibility is equally likely, invalidating the concept of probability
            - universe where noise/randomness is an intent rather than a side effect of intent alignment & development, so reversing the intent development process to be an input rather than the output of interaction rules allows certain types of information & randomness to develop
            - universe where the ratio & types of information/time allowed to develop allows/prevents certain types of information derivation about universe manipulation/traversal, which if combined with other types from adjacent universes on a certain definition of distance, would invalidate origin or other types of universes
          - universe where potential (in the form of variance injection points) is evenly distributed as a constant condition, so certainty cant develop (in any form, including time/structure/priority)
          - universe where some calculation types are conditionally/contextually possible, like at regular intervals where variance drops below a certain level because of passing adjacent universes
          - universe where information derivation-loss ratio makes calculations irrelevant because of the symmetry types present, which make info loss from info asymmetries trivial (where symmetries can be combined to offset every asymmetry)
          - universe where efficiencies develop in a way that certain priorities are incentivized despite universal constants exerting limits on direction change
            - prioritizing similarity or optimization contradicting a universe constant ratio of variance
            - prioritizing calculation types that prevent measuring information of a particular type
          - universe that involves trajectories between bases as a way to measure change (a changing interface network vs. change on an interface network)
          - universe where external universes are determining, rather than internal states or generative rules
            - coordinating rules in universe development have compounding effects on potential of universe interactions
            - universes where the generative rules, other constants/metrics, and position with respect to other universes are changeable from inside/outside (input/output sides, reversing causation)
          - the influence of one universe on another implies a notion of universe-external time (if a state change occurs, time has passed, even if the state is a change to the set of generative rules), where in reality, the universe relationships might not change (a static game), unless it's possible to coordinate/hook up their dimensions to influence each other
            - but this type of time may not exist, or may only exist conditionally when two universes interact, which doesnt change the absolute rules governing their interactions because the change stabilizes reliably enough to invalidate the idea of change of that type, so universe-external time can only exist in universe-to-universe interactions, but not in universe-to-universe relationship interactions
          - universe where time (in the form of potential or energy) is possible while the universe is being used for calculations, but decays & disperses when not being used, potentially being stored as variance in adjacent universes while not being used
          - universe where time is determined by calculation potential 
            - if something can be calculated from something else & vice versa (independent variables generating a dependent variable), time has not passed while that relationship is true
            - if something cannot be calculated from something else (asymmetry or information loss), time has passed
            - the set of time-independent calculation relationships may determine the amount of time a universe has until it either decays, compresses, changes its determining factors, or finishes its original intended calculation
          - time defined as the potential to calculate trajectories around a universe's singularities, or the ability to arrange calculations in a way that doesnt make all information calculatable
    - calculation trajectory (calculations possible in this universe or space-time used to calculate position in regard to the others, given intents possible with those calculations
      - calculating position (knowing if your space-time is a pawn/knight & the pawn/knight functions, and deriving the existence of other positions) & possible intents of that position (& the ensuing functionality) enables determining the set of possible moves on the board, the limits of the board, the point of the game, and the optimal positions/moves/states in the game, giving you a direction to move in if you can coordinate with other players
        - derive information with rules like:
          - if there is a universe that can destroy yours when adjacent, you know that its not adjacent to you
            - similarly, if there is another pair/set of destroying universes when in certain positions that are related to your universe (inputs/outputs/alternatives of yours, or cooperating with yours), you know theyre not in those positions
          - if there are rules that are invalidating to particular types of potential/information/randomness/change that have been measured or determined to be valid in some measured or possible context, you know those rules are not absolute

    - structure-information interface:
      entanglement, as the accretion of possible information into a core function (information generator, like the physical component of an assumption - a defined relationship, with its own definition of difference (reducing distance type of difference between entangled particle positions)
      polarity, as the accretion of information into a core function
      wave-function collapse, as the angle at which information appears to have one dimension of change

  - ways to navigate space-time
    - alternate routes to arrange spacetimes in a way that makes origin & target space-times adjacent or traversible
    - navigating by symmetries as a guide to reversible routes through space-times; where theres a window of opportunity to reverse trajectory (on a space-time tree branch ending with a dead-end leaf) if a structure of symmetries like a foundation or net or symmetry-generating structure is within reach

  - example of how the physics system has structures preventing certain cascading change types (local scope bubbling) & allowing others (nuclear chain reactions), partially through forces like gravity keeping objects at a distance: https://www.sciencealert.com/time-travel-through-a-quantum-world-has-nothing-to-fear-from-the-butterfly-effect
  
  - when physics rules stabilize, they attract & generate information, which gathers into measurable numbers
    - if the point of the universe is not to find the initial filters but to prevent that information from being discovered, that could keep open options for other change sources

  - an infinite series implies a stabilized symmetry (a platform for change that goes on forever) - clearly there are different degrees of stability - how do these different degrees of stability relate to different infinities like infinite sets given by number groups
    - the chain of events mentioned here implies a stability in the energy preservation with each successive event

  - type of chart: a map of the trajectory between low-to-high dimensional representations of a function

  - what attributes determine symmetries so you could differentiate between symmetries (distortion functions, origin)

  - each superposition contains components representing different possible filters for the physical laws they create at scale
    - some superpositions collapse into a particular attribute set
    - superpositions with different configurations may represent other interface queries or structures
    - knowing the internal structure of a superposition would mean we get to choose which queries come to life & become real
    - the design implies we shouldnt get to choose - but external forces (or unmeasurable/uncomputable forces inside the universe) should get to determine which configurations collapse & which differences are allowed
    - information has a lifecycle - its likelier to become more true the more its observed, up to a maximum - then it's likelier to erode as its depended on
    - observing a state (to produce the information of the observation) may initialize the static nature of that information, so other observers see either static information or lack of it depending on their perspective, as information becomes truer the more its observed, and they may focus on the lack of information or a different perspective than the initial state of the information

  - time may be a variance gap (a space where change is possible) to resolve a question/problem set - so not resolving it can preserve time, unless resolving it will allow for more potential or moving on to other variance gaps


# Quantum physics

  - processes with time irreversibility:
    - allow a state change within a symmetry's transformation space, without passing time (no change has occurred except law obedience) - a unit of required order
    - guarantees distribution of resources (energy)
    - guarantees destructibility of intelligent energy-hoarding systems (biological life)
    - prevents some powerful energy sources from being accidentally created by intelligent energy-hoarding systems (black holes)
    - allows for variance cascades
    - information increases potential for reversibility, so irreversible processes probably destroy information or evade information (never converge to measurability through alternatives)

  - independence (closed trade loops) as time storage

  - entanglement occurring from:
    - rotating around a symmetry
    - finding nearest unused/unentangled particle
    - same interface network query (same position in a system)

  - finding how to reverse historical filters (great filter) could reverse the initial filter, or create same starting conditions to go in a different direction, looping around to initial filter
  
  - examine a universe without differentiation (every particle containing universe has the same starting resource point & limits)

  - examine when randomness can masquerade as entanglement due to limited options of core function interactions due to the system development being in an initial phase

  - information organized by relevance & efficiency

  - useful for computing attribute & variance flow as well as flow between flow of energy into measurement delivery 
    (optimize energy distribution between particle position/spin attributes according to measurement limits)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation

  - look for new objects in inter-system physics - as an object occupies a current & target system as well as the space in between that isnt classifiable
    - what physics apply between systems (space-times here)
      https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/white-dwarf-causes-strange-relativity-effect-called-frame-dragging/

  - examine how info is being destroyed in black holes & in quantum physics - is this a process that can be used for encryption or is the info irretrievable?

  - scale transitions

      - give example of emergent effects of phase/scale transitions across threshold values that exert more variance than systems can hold

      - quantum scale transitions as delegation of information to optimal/efficient/low-energy positions
        - appears to be in multiple positions until it determines which position is more efficient or easier to maintain
      
  - quantum => info => energy dissipation:
    - when quantum superposition resolves into information, which resolves into efficiency & energy, how does it cycle back into enabling additional variance (more quantum uncertainties)
    - theres an element of dimensional collapse/compression/removal involved in these processes, releasing the variance from the structures that store it
    - the dimensions of potential in a superposition collapse into information about particle attributes
    - the dimensions of information collapse into energy, which can collapse into efficiency (path of least resistance that achieves an intent) if combined with enough other efficiency pathways
    - examine the pattern of high dimensional objects appearing to have lower dimensions at various points of measurement
      - this is similar to alternate paths producing the same output from the same input
      - as variance flows into various dimension sets, the overlap of output with other dimension sets is less likely but not impossible & may occur at predictable intervals,
        like how integers have more limiting attributes than numbers in between, so boundary physics applies to integers & they can act as a filter
    - examine when emerging attributes cant be contained within a space & leak into others


  - universe as a topology, where points are interface network queries

  - nonlocality is produced by similarities in interface queries, which output similar information (space-times that are linked by similarity)
    - the interface queries formatted as filters producing information allow similar structures to develop, and within those structures, information about the interface filters can be derived (creating an intrinsic link between any space-time produced by that query, given that they can understand their own space-time and infer the existence of similar space-times, putting them in the same observer position)
      - this information can then be used as a base/foundation for:
        - other information to develop, which may be useful to the other similar space-times (and energy can be allocated based on usage, so the space-times have a connection on this energy sharing (energy formatted as information), and may draw those space-times together as the connection is used more (possibly generating gravity or other forces that would draw them together, or a type of energy connecting the two space-times/information bits output by the query)
        - accessing other information, like the output of other adjacent interface queries, where the base acts like the first rung of a ladder
      - the sequence of information formats to get from the first rung to a higher position depends on whether adjacent space-times can be used to infer unknown interfaces not-derivable with the interface query of the origin space-time
      - can they get to another interface with a limit set (calculation limit), a calculation set (lossy algorithm), an information set (encrypted information, quantum information), randomness (lack of information) injections?
      - what efficient paths (wormholes) are allowed within a topology of space-times (with their limits, uncertainties, calculations, symmetries, etc)?
      - can a universe be converted to a boundary (pushed past threshold, breaking the balance between the universe & the boundary) & injected with randomness to use as a filter for information to get to other universe
      - can a universe be condensed/broken/formatted to be able to slip through the boundary (does the boundary need an input like energy, does its existence depend on the universe, does it have unenforced rules)
        - can energy be transmitted through the universe boundary
      - what happens to a universe or space-time with information removed, either by radiation or another method?

      - structure is aggregated information/certainty, which implies that if a structure exists, it can be calculated
      - structures can contain uncertainties if the space in the structure is not enforced enough (isnt filled with structures)
      - information (structure) is an energy format
      - in order for information to exist, there has to be structure (structure can be equated with information)
      - structures capable of holding information can exert an attractive force on that information (if it's imminent or exists in an adjacent structure & is looking for a way to preserve state)
        - what structures can hold the information of physics questions like how to:
          - connect space-times
          - preserve information in black holes
          - break a universe boundary (as mentioned here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end-20201029/)

        - this means that in order to hold/attract/preserve/calculate different types of information, you can generate new structures to hold the information you need (like a space-time sequence with uncertainties aligned to allow a certain energy/information type to develop)

      - in order for time to exist, there has to be other possible states (change has to be possible)
      - in order for space-times to be connectable, there has to be potential (a chain of uncertainties in the host system structure, in which a wormhole or connecting/attracting force or energy type can form)
        - which uncertainties, when positioned adjacently, can create a structure in which information possible in one space-time can be communicated to another?
          - uncertainties can be captured on interfaces and formatted as filters with unenforced rules
            - a sequence of space-times with coordinating uncertainties for a 'connection' intent may operate by linking uncertainty inputs/outputs in the sequence
              - which space-times would have these coordinating sequences in the same position that can align across space-times?

      - can a symmetry be injected into or generated in a system cascading irreversibly toward maximal entropy, without integrating it with another system?
        - can you break information in the system by overloading it (using it as a foundational interface out of scope so it cant hold all the information allocated to it)
        - can you break an irreversibility by integrating it with another irreversibility in the system
        - can you generate randomness from within a closed/isolated high/maximal entropy system

      - entropy can only be really measured once a system is used to calculate a known quantity to test if the system actually offers certainty, and this full calculation of entropy can never be totally measured (tested in all possible systems/states for all possible calculations in all possible structures like sequences)
        - for instance, when a space-time splits bc an uncertainty develops & two outcomes (microstates) occur simultaneously, resulting in an extra macrostate (multiple/both/either)
        - or when the system is about to lose the ability to capture the concept of 'sequence' or a change type or information about a previous value in the microstate in its structure (bc the states/usage interacted in a way that disrupted the system), in which case the microstates can not describe the system anymore
        
        - for instance, if two microstates being adjacent creates a higher probability of either occurring, or if different microstates exert an attractive force, or if microstates can combine or merge to create new microstates or interact similarly with macrostates
          
          - example: 'same', 'reversed', 'different' macrostates of a two-try coin flip microstate have different relationships (such as similarity) to each other
            
            - can state aggregate or be injected into a stateless process (information injection to the first or second flip, like probability or adjacent microstates)
              - for example, given the relative unlikelihood of equivalent states occurring in a sequence compared to different states occurring in a sequence, are differences, corrupted information, or uncertainties likelier to stabilize, or increase/compound/generate new differences?
              
              - can the events, probabilities (of states, probability distributions, conditional/independent probabilities, system equilibrium/lack of change), states influence the position (first, second), structure (sequence), or type (up/down) variables? 
                - do the symmetries between similar states (same, different, reversed) offer any influence on other symmetries (change types/range of other system params)
                  - is the system of symmetries also approaching maximum entropy if the host system is doing so?

            - randomness types, connections, sources: 
                
                - does randomness of each toss depend on lack of structure changing/aggregating through interactions of these parameters? 
                  - if randomness depends on that, randomness is not just an input, its also an output (of the condition that the system does not change)
                
                - can randomness be generated another way (using different metadata), and how does that randomness interact with the input randomness of possible outcomes of each flip
                  - how can structure be removed to reduce information (creating possible source of randomness)? 
                    - are the inputs to probability subject to randomness injection?
                    - randomness injection probabilities for metadata:
                      - objects: event
                      - inputs:
                        - states: outcome sequence, outcome sequence equivalence
                        - structures: symmetry, equivalence
                        - params: velocity, number of rotations, angle (highest probability of a randomness injection is here)
                        - interaction between probability types, structures, & bases

                      - interacting (aggregate) probabilities of states
                        - after getting tails in the first flip, the probability of tails in the next flip is still 50%
                        - the probability of a same outcome vs. a different outcome overall (macrostate) is 50% for a different type of equivalencee (50% for T-H & H-T and 50% for T-T & H-H)

            - can you equate one state (different) with a structure of another (same combined with reversed)
            - is the system capable of having its information corrupted (like if time parameter is removed), so information from different states may merge or otherwise change
            - does probability have physics favoring changes to a distribution in a vacuum?

            - probability types
              - probability trajectories across states
                - examine interaction of probabilities of states/outcomes at different times (before first toss, before second toss)
              - minimum tosses to measure probability of states/outcomes & other metadata like symmetries
              - emerging states at different scopes (superstates & atomic states)
              - emerging probability during flip as a function of motion trajectories (velocity, number of rotations, time)
                - what is the interaction space of different value sets of these parameters, and what probabilities are they associated with?
