      - how to generate the target solution of 'a source of duplications'
        
        - start at the enabling structure of duplications (multiple sets having different final direction value):
          - find 'overlap' or 'combination' states (with sets including multiple different final operations) and find a way to connect them with standard objects (countably infinite sets with a final value determined by the final operation's direction) using allowed operations (rotation)
        
        - start at the standard structure (one set having same final direction value):
          - apply adjacent transforms like rotation to the standard structure (countably infinite sets that are complete, having their final value determined)
        
        - identify the highest-variation changes (like changes in final values between adjacent states - since one state has north/south/east nodes, the next state has only east nodes) as a possible source of changes for other values (a change in one value can produce a change in another value if theyre relevant)
      
      - generate the standard structure of countable infinite
        
        - use 'irrationality' to generate the standard structure of countable infinite sets in the first place (enough difference in rotation angles to not generate an uncountable infinity, but restrictions on the angles in that they remain static & restriction in movement avoiding the opposite of the previous direction)

        - during the creation of a set of points having the same previous final direction, there will be states where the previous directions of points in the state are maximally different (not every state will have the same previous direction) bc a countable infinite set is not a series of repeating the same rotation, and differences in corresponding rotations across sets are allowed

      - how to identify the standard structure (countable infinity) as a useful structure
      
        - its required to use the standard structure to base transforms off of (like a countable infinity) bc its a subset of the original, and you have to use the original structure as an input to generate the target solution structure
          - identify structures (components/attributes) of the sphere which can be used as components/inputs of the solution
            - subsets of the sphere
            - operations like 'rotation', 'repeat infinitely'
            - uncountably infinite points
          - apply 'structure' interface to find possible standard structures like 'differences' in these structures of the sphere
            - identify differences in relevant attributes ('number of points', 'location of points', 'generative method of points') that different structures ('subsets') of the sphere can have
              - attribute: cardinality of infinities
          - identify whether differences in those attributes would be useful (in producing a useful difference/similarity)
            - what is the relationship between countable & uncountable infinite sets
              - can one infinity type be generated from another
                - can an uncountable infinity be generated from a countable one
                  - this seems like it could be possible, identifying 'countable infinities' as a possible useful structure
              - what ways can countable infinities be generated that makes them exclusive (no repeated points)
              - what is adjacent to a countable infinity if generated a particular way that is not adjacent to an uncountable infinity
              - what functions does a countable infinity have that an uncountable infinity does not

      - question
        - how is 'infinity' related to 'all possible values of that type or other structure'

      - other relevant insights
        - infinity - 1 = infinity
          - applying adjacent operations like adding/subtracting values to infinity wont change it into a non-infinity object
          - this means adjacent operations are allowed within the definition while maintaining the definition
          - since 'countably infinite sets' are the structure involving infinity, apply this operation to the 'countably infinite sets'
          - what is produced by removing the defining items of a set (like start point, end point)
            - removing the start point changes the set into another set having the new start point
            - removing the end point by undoing the last rotation includes all sets with the second-to-last point as their endpoint
              - for a set with final rotation of 'east', this second-to-last set couldnt include the set with a final 'west rotation', bc a 'west rotation' immediately preceding a final 'east rotation' is disallowed by the rules where a rotation cant be immediately reversed by the following operation
            - the restriction of 'not undoing a rotation immediately after the rotation' is required to create a unique infinite set, but doesnt have to be applied across all operations (undoing a rotation is allowed after the set creation)
          - now we know that an adjacent state of the set with a final 'east rotation' includes at least three other sets (or have a implication of this to check with other definitions, requirements & operations)
        - we reached this insight by applying the insight path (which is also an interface query)
          - apply 'adjacent operations' (add/sum) to relevant objects in the problem definition ('infinite countable sets') to create 'interim structures' ('sets having a unique final rotation or point type')
          - apply 'rules defined in the problem space' ('no immediate reversals of rotations') to 'interim structures'
          - identify 'structural similarities' to the 'interim structures' or 'outputs of those adjacent operations' ('if a second-to-last set contains other relevant sets')

    - 'cellular automata' as a 'uniform function network state machine depicting interactivity (interaction space or convolution) between a function & itself'

    - structures of 'strictness' (such as 'always applying worst case scenario') as structures of 'truth' and 'relevance'

    - add to dimension definition routes:
      - 'adding an independent sequence/state change type to other change types, containing but not changing or limiting other change types of lower dimensions'
      - limiting a change type to two possible values requires a structure in the form of a value (line, or hyperplane) separating them

    - godel incompleteness
      - why would a proving system not be able to prove its own truth? if there are structures not generatable/provable in the system, and at least one of those structures is required to prove it
        - what structure would be required to prove a system:
          - guaranteed impossibility/lack of contradictory input-output connection violating the input-output connections allowed by the system
        - what structure would not be generated in the system
        - what structure would not be generated in the system & also be required to prove a system
        
    - a set of related change types (like a sequence of fourier/taylor expansion terms providing different polynomials) provides different change types that can be combined to produce the required changes to produce a function
    - example 'alternate connection' structure: wheels (rotations of circles) provide an alternate connection between waves & circles, in addition to trig functions
    - fourier transform is an example of energy from change stabilizing into a pattern of a new change type - https://mathlets.org/mathlets/discrete-fourier-transform/
    
  - what is the connection between fractals & randomness
    - fractals are self-referential, just like polynomial functions with non-1/0 exponential terms, which are frequently used to model dynamic/chaotic systems with many structures of randomness
    - fractals are composed of patterns that scale, like a pattern in a function can hold across varying parameters
    - fractals have incremental & incrementally decreasing change, like polynomial functions with non-1/0 exponential terms have
    - why would a term interact with itself in a dynamic/chaotic/complex system? bc its composed of isolated components that interact on the same level, or bc interactions result in effective boundaries forming where enough random variable interactions have a net effect of creating an interaction barrier, or bc different differences in an input should have different differences in output (differences in one section should produce small change, and differences in another section should produce large change) thus requiring a non-1/0 exponent, bc the two variables are not an exclusive relationship & are impacted by other variables, or bc there are emergent/threshold/sequential/value-specific effects of the input (like proximity to limit/inflection values)
    - the nonlinear curve exists between a standard connection function (constant sloped line) and an isolation self-referential (referring to its center) structure (circle)
      - what is the value of formatting a function with a non-1/0 exponential term as an arc/tangent on a circle - are circles useful as a unit structure forming polynomials (meaning other than sin/cos functions, like hyperbolic functions, parabolas, etc) that could replace the original polynomial terms in a useful way for visualization
        - what is the meaning of a circle unit term vs. the original polynomial variable (does the circle represent some isolated or unit change type of the variable)
