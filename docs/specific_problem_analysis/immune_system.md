  - immune function
    Innate immune cells (such as macrophages, neutrophils, and NK cells) 
      serve as the body’s first line of defense against pathogens. 
      are quick to respond to threats, innate immune cells carry out less specific responses to individual pathogens

  - adaptive immune cells (namely T cells and B cells) 
      are slower to respond but produce and respond to antibodies, which enables the immune system to remember past infections for future defense
      B cells develop antibodies against the pathogens they encounter, which enable them to respond more efficiently during a second encounter
      immune cells coordinate by secreting cytokines — molecules that attract other immune cells to the site of infection and regulate their activation or suppression

  - glutamine
      cell proliferation
      respiratory fuel
      enhance stimulated immune cell function
      effect of extracellular glutamine concentration on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production
      macrophage phagocytic 
      secretory activities 
      neutrophil bacterial killing

  - melatonin
      increases in macrophage cells
      increases in NK cells in the bone marrow
      stimulated innate immune cell activity

  - curcumin
      enhance the responses of antibodies
      promote the immune response of lymphocytes (white blood cells)
      increase B cell proliferation in the intestines
      reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines

  - vitamin d
    stimulating the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which are endogenous antibiotics (i.e., antibiotics that originate within an organism)

  - probiotics
      stimulate protective responses from intestinal epithelial cells
      enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of NK cells in the spleen
      induce the production of immunity-enhancing proteins in connective tissues
      reinforce intestinal barrier integrity through increased gene expression
      shift the composition of the gut toward specific beneficial bacteria

  - eha/dha
    synthesize potent signal molecules that help lower cell stress responses
    regulate the activities of macrophage cells, which play a critical role in the body’s innate immune defense by patrolling for invading pathogens and working to eliminate them 
    promote innate immune function
      increasing the number and phagocytic capacity of neutrophil cells—a process (where the cell destroys a virus or infected cell by binding to it and engulfing it)
    adaptive immune function
      promoting the growth and specialization of certain types of T cells
      increasing the number and percentages of B cell populations in different tissues

- other rules:
  - Dark leafy green vegetables, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, tomatoes, strawberries and carrots are all nutrient rich produce that may increase t-cells. 
  - Folic acid, vitamin B 6, riboflavin and thiamin are particularly important to the proper functioning of t-cells and their quantity


- out of this set of functions for each substance, derive the following indexed info & search patterns to find substances for an overall "immune system".function-enhancing effect:

  - search terms:

    - components:

      - primary component (cell) type: t-cell, b-cell, nk cell, neutrophil, macrophage, lymphocyte - white blood cell, cytokine, antibody, antimicrobial peptide, endogenous antibiotics
        - primary component function/input
      - host system (immune response) type: adaptive, innate, stress
        - host system function/input
      - sub-system type: intestinal, spleen, connective tissues, genes, beneficial bacteria, bone marrow, inflammation, stress
        - sub-system function/input
      - positive components: immune cells, bacteria, adaptive/innate immune response, anti-inflammatory, communication, response
      - negative components: stress, stress response, inflammation, pro-inflammatory, phagocytes, bacteria, microbes, pathogens

    - synonyms:

      - input: fuel
      - output: effect
      - immune: anti-inflammatory, protective, pro-
      - reduce: regulate, lower, destroy, fight, kill, -cytic, -cidal, anti-
        - conditions: regulate expression
      - increase: build/synthesize/produce/proliferate, help/promote/enhance, synergistic, induce/enable/activate/catalyze/stimulate/trigger
        - conditions: stimulate/induce production, reinforce, strengthen integrity, enhance immunity/activity
      - change:
        - conditions: shift toward

    - functions

      - negative change types
        - reduce count/function/input of positive components
        - increase count/function/input of negative components

      - positive change types
        - increase count/function/input of positive components
        - reduce count/function/input of negative components

    - aggregate terms:
        - component: function, attribute (type, input, output), sub-component
        - component set: primary component or sub-system or host system

    - search patterns:
      - increase positive primary components (t-cells)
      - reduce negative sub-system type components (stress signals, proinflammatory expression)
      - increase positive sub-system type components (intestinal protection/barrier, bone marrow production function)
      - component.name [immune response type, cell type, cell function] input
      - increase positive component set

- sample output should include: vitamin c, echinacea, astragalus, zinc
- subsequent queries can chain inputs (find input of input of component to enhance, find input of component with functionality of component that cant be produced, etc)

- this is an application of the interfaces to the immune system
  - interface application:
    - information interface (conditions)
      - object interface (components, functions, attributes)
        - abstract interface (types rather than specific implementations)
          - change interface (condense similar synonyms)
            - function interface (input/output (fuel/effects/functionality))
              - intent interface (positive/neutral/negative)
    - generate aggregate terms used for injecting multiple options (component)
    - identify relevant combinations (increase positive resources/effects/processes/states, reduce negative resources/effects/processes/states)
    - generate relevant patterns with aggregate terms

  - to produce an output on the pattern interface, to generate the set of queries to find the compounds that will fulfill the original input intent 'enhance the immune system functionality'
