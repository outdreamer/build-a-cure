## Prediction markets


  - definitions:
    - derivatives/options/other instruments: possible money if your prediction about future value is correct (where value is highly subject to risk & influenced by many factors & randomness)
    - insurance: future money from negative unlikely predictions occur
    - debt: temporary money/resources in exchange for possible future value of a prediction (like that your plan will succeed or that a resource will increase in value), & possible future debt if purchased resources or plans dont increase in value

  - diversification in that context means creating an investment portfolio/smart contract based on permutations of the insight powering the bet and the likely distortions of the insight, as well as permutations of related bet assumptions & other objects, such as a logical tree of conditions & tests to deactivate that investment
  
  - borrow from lenders with aligned incentives to borrowers' planned resource usage/investments
  
  - hedge the risk of borrowing by investing a ratio in alternatives/contradictory trends/products

    - example: borrow to start a delivery business vs. investing in local gardening or 3d printing, and be prepared with a plan for investing resources when delivery business turns into supply pipeline, logistics, auto-mining, or tech business


  - the logical flow of these objects given their definitions is to arrange possible prediction money, risk expectation, and temporary money/possible future debt in a way that creates a self-sustaining loop that keeps revenue streams active enough to keep the circuit accessible or convert it into a more profitable one

    - for example the combinations:
      - 'the risk expectation of possible future debt'
      - 'a prediction payoff of a risk expectation'
      - 'temporary money borrowed from a prediction funded by value prediction & risk expectation payoffs'

    - a three-item circuit such as:
        - predict future debt (default of a loan) to get a payoff if loan default occurs
        - insure against future debt (default of a loan) to get a claim payment if loan default occurs
        - invest temporary resources borrowed in prediction & risk analysis tools/methods or loan business dependencies

    - a one-item circuit: 
      - borrow from investors who already invested in dependencies of your plan or bought insurance from a company that did
      - go into debt to fund purchase of insurance against interest rate increase

    - a circuit based on randomness:
      - invest borrowed resources in projects/patterns/types that appear frequently in diversified portfolios - they may be uncertain in isolation, but given the frequency of their investment & bundling, they may be less uncertain

    - building a structure logically

      - system analysis:

        - given a set of contradictory predictions (a trade-off or where only one prediction can be true), you can buy insurance against:
          - the question of which one is true being invalidated
          - the predictions having a wrong assumption restricting it to two options & the third option being true
          - the prediction with higher investment having lower return
          - either or both predictions having no return
          - the assumption of them being mutually exclusive being wrong and both being capable of being true at the same time

      - causal analysis:

        - investing in something can increase the value of it
        - predicting an event can increase the probability of it
        - buying insurance against something can decrease the risk and the payoff value (bc the insurance company may invest in decreasing the cost of fixing it & change the terms)
        
      - structural analysis:
        
        - which structures (set, tree, loop, network) are useful to frame investing objects (stock, derivatives, price, product, purchase, loan, insurance, probability, value, payoff, risk, etc)

      - core analysis:
        
        - which core component combinations are already used (such as 'option to sell', 'promise to buy', 'periodic repayment of temporary borrowed at interest', etc) and what are the next combinations on other layers or filling in gaps on existing layers?
        
        - given core functions (sell, buy, bundle, trade, promise, predict, etc) and core objects (option, transaction, contract, etc) and core attributes (probability, dependencies, value), what useful combined objects can be generated?
          - value: initial value, combined value, potential value, conditional value


    - these structures like combinations, embeddings, and loops can be used to construct an optimal investment tree or network to allocate resources in a way that maximizes payoff potential

    - arranging these objects in a useful way can create exploit opportunities
      - example: if one risk is artificially increased by spoofers during risk expectation calculation

    - these objects can be arranged in optimal ways using system rules & filters like:
      - check for aligned intent (maximize profit) of combinations & other structures
      - check for adjacent interactions (a prediction can take information as input, so any object that generates information is one of the candidates for the preceding object to a prediction in a sequence)
      - check for compounding & cooperative effects, which generate efficiencies
      - check for false similarities to avoid side effects
      - use alternate definition routes to check for alternate similarities and routes between objects
      - standardize definitions to use same terms where possible to calculate outputs (frame prediction, risk, and resource investment objects in terms of payoffs, risk/probability, dependencies, & assumptions)

  - core investment attributes:
    - fundamental
    - abstract
    - produces a valuable attribute in relevant problem space
    - produces a proxy for work (trust)
    - can override fundamental rules (like those regarding power structures)
    - can increase interaction rate/space
    - produces attribute alignments & other important system objects that output change, stability, or other valuable system attributes
    - captures previously unhandled variance
    - interface good (an average/limit, a currency, an interim good)

  - risk based on key metrics like:

    - max price of a good, given its relative value cap, absent of extreme or phase shift conditions like war
    - 'risk caps' (worst case scenario as a standard) and 'potential caps' (potential value of good's attributes/components) in various market condition types (applying filters to avoid worst positions)
    - attribute combinations that create phase shifts (alignments, resolved conflicts)
    - intersecting interfaces that can override logical positions (social interface can influence even basic good prices like vitamins/food)
    - variance flow (adjacent input/outputs/systems compromised) & adjacent variance objects allowed to interact 
    - exploit potential (exploits can be assumed as guaranteed, so investments in easily exploited products should be either concentrated to guard against these, or distributed)

  - you can influence other people's predictions
    - providing prediction tools (algorithms, delivery platforms, APIs, tutorials)
    - tracking usage of those tools
    - indirect market manipulation, through trust established by making your prior predictions true
  - directly influence supply/demand & make bets on your influence

  - organizing the stock market similarly to insurance to inject agency, investors can influence the market so that objects like competitions/incentives are created in a way that maximizes gains (making industry players compete in an industry that your other investment is capable of invalidating if they stop improving customer service vs. certain product features), or creating platform/foundation tools that are necessary components of the industry (prediction tools, specifically claim-testing tools or price assessment tools), or evaluating agent interactions at scale (what are the obvious ways & distortions of those ways to manipulate/evaluate/predict the market, who has the ability to act on those manipulations, and what is the net effect if all agents who can act on that do so)

  - financial risk products

    - routes between nodes with different information perspectives can optimize for load-balancing of the payout liability, or maximizing asset flow/trades/distribution, or connecting outcomes (creating a circuit rather than a one-directional rule or decision fork)

      - allocating better decision information, models & tools to those with fewer assets or whose bets dont pay off can offset initial resource imbalances, offering better risk assessments & trades to those who need them

      - distributing info & tools (like probability/causal analysis, fallacy/incentive/insider trading identification) is one way to reduce risk across agents

      - exchange of funds should be tied to value creation by default, unless the funds are invested in useful high-value research, which has inherent necessary valid risk (as opposed to risk of buying a faulty product that cant be converted to something useful in an adjacent way, which happens frequently and is from bad design/implementation rather than necessity because of fast research)

        - value can be created by valuable attributes like convenience, speed, efficiency, minimized cost, quality, relevance, fairness
        - this value can be to agents in the transaction or to society
        - value creation isnt guaranteed, like when you buy property that breaks & is unfixable, but each transaction should have a fallback mechanism to create value, rather than relying on insurance
        - the fallback can be decision analysis tools, tax deductions, or insurance payouts, but it can also be built-in to the transaction contract
          - if your house is burned down, you can have a fallback default transaction designed to sell the data about what caused the fire, sell the property to someone who doesnt want to use any damaged infrastructure (pipelines, electricity) or to researchers who need fire byproducts to test with or a small business thats been trying to move in to that neighborhood but wants to do so at lower cost
          - this transaction would be designed by default with cost profiles for each option (cost/benefit of the transaction) based on specific demand for attributes created by the event - matching the negative event with the highest adjacent profit opportunities in the market by algorithm to minimize their losses
      
    - trading predictions for value & risk isnt always the trade being made

      - sometimes its trading predicting that the price will go up (buyer) for information that the price will go down (insider trading short seller)
      - or trading a prediction of price increase for market demand risk + disaster risk
      - the set of these trades can be optimized to make all agents better off most of the time
      - how do you arrange trades so the insurance company, supply company, homeowner, and future property owners are ok when a house burns down?
        - the attributes created by the fire include (depending on reason for the fire & damage caused):
          - adjacent houses are cheaper
          - land of house is cheaper
          - infrastructure repair costs may occur (power lines, pipelines)
          - byproducts are generated (heat, carbon)
        - there are agents that can benefit from most attributes created by the event
          - if you can find a buyer interested in moving in at lower cost or someone interested in the neighborhood (real estate developer), the fire might not produce a major loss for the homeowner, even without insurance
          - if repair costs are high, repair companies can purchase information of where new opportunities are available & what their possible profit is
          - if the house is near enough to a water source, it can be turned into a well or other natural resource supply, so the neighborhood could buy the property directly or with taxes
          - you can use the fire as a temporary energy source for the neighborhood which can be distributed with markets/taxes (whether they opt-in to buy the equipment to do that)
        - you can sell the risk of the house burning down beforehand, so that if the risk of it happening is 20%, you sell the risk of it not happening to people who need/earn money more (or people with existing incentives against the house burning down if its a higher cost than benefit across all agents, so no one has an incentive for arson) & sell the risk of it happening to people who dont need/earn money (or people with existing incentives against the house burning down)

      - similarly, other sources of systemic risks like natural disasters can be used for creating value 

        - if a flood happens, suppliers & researchers can pivot to using damaged wood as their building material (researchers can experiment on converting it to a useful resource & then its used as a default supply source, or researchers are assigned to convert dead wood into plants more efficiently)

        - product invalidation with tech produces obsolete tech, which can be allocated to neighborhood recycling centers rather than taken away so it can be used as a community supply for engineering & research

        - a pandemic produces either:
          - high demand for protective supplies (so people can still go out), medical service suppliers, cleaning services, delivery services
          - high demand for tech to invalidate protective supplies (buy computers/internet/robots/drones so people dont have to go out, and minimize quarantine time with medical solution tech investments)
          
        - the change in demand isnt likely to be accompanied by climate consciousness (people would rather buy gloves right away than wait for environmentally friendly gloves), so theres some increase in systemic risk bc of the requirements for fast solutions - companies with climate-friendly solutions can benefit if they can scale supply quicker, which will reduce risk for everyone
        - companies that adapt quickly, companies already in manufacturing business, companies building tech, and companies that host/enable trades will already be in position to benefit
        - companies building testing tools are another possible beneficiary, if people still need to interact (if you dont buy computers/internet/robots and medical solutions)

    - there can be a cap on financial instruments with better price/relative value assessments, so that someone cant buy something at a higher price out of irrational fear (someone whos afraid of fire is likelier to pay more for insurance, even if the risk doesnt match their price point given their irrational fear) or as a premium (charged more bc they earn more)

    - you can also calculate the fewest bets that are necessary (invest in a small business like an experiment automator printer, invest in a research project like determining cause of a systemic imbalance, invest in a particular solution like a farming technology) that will trigger the phase shifts necessary to produce an outcome (protect the environment from risk spirals or cascades or toxic causal shapes like tangled networks or one-directional trees)

    - taking the net outcome of all known bets (info/pattern/probability bets, industry bets, product bets, price bets, demand bets, tech bets, uncertainty bets) & bet patterns (diversify risk levels & timing in portfolio) can probably predict future risks (new incentives/priorities, new products/tech, new attribute sets, new alliances, new paradoxes (conflicting products becoming more popular), new trade loops, new financial instruments) - which can be used to adjust recommended price of a bet once the relative value is known, if that risk outcome is good across agents

      - example: 'if 50 people dont take this bet, another alternative tech will probably develop at lower cost' or 'if 100 people invest at this price, this product will enable investment in these fields given these company contracts'

    - load-balancing can also be automated between funds, so one fund isnt overloaded with liabilities - rather than one fund that made a bad bet bearing the cost, they get updates to their decision models (explaining why a price was false or why a natural event occurred), a small percentage is distributed to funds that arent as socially conscious (dont align their incentives with socially conscious intents, or create trades that prioritize value creation, or organize their trades to build loops so incentives are connected across agents)


## Loan markets

  - loan: represents belief in potential future relative value increase during loan term (potential value of their existing resources * work)
  - interest rate is supposed to reflect lower rate than borrower ROI
  - aggregate loans by purpose
    - borrowers contribute borrowed funds & price information (how much theyd pay for a solution) to finance research to solve malaria/water cleaning problems that generate problems leading to inability to pay
  - competition between loaners creates market for loans between loaners (tala owes m-pesa or vice versa)
    - so exploitative loaners become indebted to less exploitative loaners who offer more money/lower interest rates, bc borrowers have an incentivized out that loaners dont have
  - optimal transport can be applied to create repayment groups
    - which borrowers can team up to repay which loans in which order to reduce overall interest rate
    - which borrowers can trade work/debt/interest rates in a way that benefits both of them
    - which borrowers can trade resources to lower risk of repayment-preventing problems (borrowers with malaria medicine, borrowers with electricity) & how to distribute these borrowers in repayment groups
  - interest rates can be determined from local assessments
    - local traders can often better assess someone's ability to repay because they have information that the app does not, and might increase the likelihood to repay based on their relationship & by the investment in that relationship, whereas the app has no pre-existing relationship to bank on
  - high interest rate loans are only more valuable than normal interest rate loans if there is an ability to pay & a lack of competition between loaners
    - but if there is an ability to pay, high interest rate loans have value and can be aggregated like an asset
  - dead-end borrowers (resources arent used to create value, so they exit the economy, leaving only information about default data) can be connected with low-risk borrowers to reduce risk of default
  - borrowers shouldnt be borrowing to do things that dont benefit other borrowers & the economy as a whole
    - dead-end loans to buy food rather than food-production equipment (water cleaner, electricity source, seeds) arent as useful as loans to buy things that enable buying luxury inputs or efficiencies/reusable resources, so loans for higher distribution of asset contribution should have lower interest rates to incentivize them
    - loans to buy resources should occur in a certain order:
      - first buy necessary luxury (one-time) inputs (food, medicine)
      - then a round of value-creating or reusable inputs (seeds, equipment, business inputs, water-cleaning machine, electricity source, education, device)
      - then require viewing free educational materials to increase skills before a lower-interest rate or extra loan is possible
      - then more luxury inputs can be financed if necessary
  - prevent the money borrowed being used for high-risk gambling with app coordination
  - loaners can provide gambling apps to increase repayment rates

    - this is an example of:

      applying the combination of abstract strategies:

        - 'switching chains of outputs to inputs to check for quick optimizations'
        - 'applying function (switch/change/combine) object identities'

      or applying the alternative strategy:
        - change shape 'z' (loaners send money to borrowers, who send money to gambling app providers, who send money elsewhere) to shape 'circuit' (loaners send money to borrowers, who send money to gambling app providers, who are the loaners)
        - another variant of this is for the loaners to provide a service the gambling app providers want, so they make a profit from that transaction anyway and the money still comes back to them
        - another optimization is for the loaners to invest the money from this transaction to create lower interest rates & other perks for borrowers
        - loaners can provide the gambling app but store the money in a savings account until the borrower needs it & re-invest in goods/projects that would help the borrower, or directly apply it to the borrowers' account, or store it in one account & use it to help the borrowers most in need like an actual lottery

        - gambling & other vice apps (scam, hacking, drug dealing apps) can be used to fund social safety net programs, where scams are applied to white collar criminals and exploitative drug dealers who sell narcotics are 'robbed' regularly on the app where the money goes to social safety net funds

      with problem space metadata:

        - inputs: "borrowers' money"
        - target output: 'repayment of loans'
        - function of 'providing gambling app' takes borrowers' money as input
        - intent: "route borrowers' money to loaners"

      with strategy combination (solution) output:
        - if gambler & loaner objects are merged, 'providing gambling app' can route borrowers' money inputs to target output of 'repayment of loans'

  - gambling apps can be run by borrowers
  - calculate ROI of gambling apps & disclose who will get their money & what they typically use it for & publish data to users before they participate
  - lower interest rate option on loan if borrowers agree to spend ratio of loan on useful inputs, or purchase from other borrowers' businesses, or teach other borrowers skills, or convince other borrowers to uninstall gambling or other borrowing apps for x days or repay their loans
  - allow loans to buy certain goods that are in demand in their area
    - allow one borrower to buy a cow at a lower rate if their neighbor needs to buy milk
  - offer services estimating best use of resources (if they can make art, tell them which neighborhood cities will offer best price, given bus fare or cost of moving there)
  - allow borrowers to pay with information about what problems borrowers face or what problems prevent repayment or which tactics work best to secure repayment

 ## Economic impact/contribution


    I. Solution creation (Job creation from value creation)

      - takes the form of releasing stored funds (previously uninvested liquid savings) to laborers, ideally to build a new solution out of created value (innovation)


    II. Problem switching (Job switch incentivization)

      - takes the form of creating an incentive to move from one labor type (low skill, automatable) to another (high skill, more complex)

        - this is what companies usually mean when they claim they "created jobs" - most of their new employees were already employed in other jobs, but the company decided that a project would make them more money than it cost to build, and that the net profit was worth offering a higher salary to these lower-skilled laborers that would incentivize them to switch jobs

          - so the net impact was not actually adding jobs to the economy, but incentivizing job switches
          - however, if the previous lower-skilled jobs are automated, then the total number of jobs in the economy is usually reduced 
            (unless all of the workers in the lower-skilled jobs had a 1:1 switch rate to new higher-skilled jobs, meaning no lower-skilled workers are unemployed after their jobs are automated)


    III. Problem allocation (Job distribution)

        - problems can be allocated by market forces, by resource limits (info access, skills limits, location, convenience), by inefficiencies/variance, and by automation/innovation
        - they can also be allocated artificially by organizations like companies/govts
    

    IV. Problem reduction (Job invalidation/reduction)

        - product demand reduction:
          - trend phases (if gardening becomes a popular hobby among hikers, replacing hiking activity, so hobby equipment demand changes from hiking equipment to gardening equipment)

        - labor demand reduction:
          - automation (less labor is necessary to solve the same problem because the solution was automated)


    V. Problem creation (Job increase)

        - labor demand increase without value-creation:

          - solution problems (more labor is necessary to solve the same problem because the solution was sub-optimal or incorrect)

            - example: if a vacuum robot starts eating cats, the robot company may have to hire more devs to fix the cat-eating problem, if its complex enough to not be coverable by their existing labor resources

            - this incentivizes devs to create problems to reduce their workload or ensure they have a steady supply of work, and disincentivizes value-creation

          - labor demand for a new job category is artificially created (with sub-optimal logic) that doesnt add value to the labor market or value of the product (project manager)

        - rent-seeking

          - existing resource distribution incentivizes artificial marketing of sub-optimal goods that dont add value to the market but rather allow the suppliers to engage in rent-seeking to build competitive moats:
            - platform dependency
            - user base dependency (addictive drugs, product component & version dependencies)
            - ad dependency to reach customers, vs. direct optimal matching of problem (info demand) and solution (info supply)

          - rent-seeking behavior is only justifiable when the company uses profits to create more benefits than they require in rent (rent-seeking profits invested in successful societal problem-solving)


    VI. Value maintenace

      - money: stored labor 

      - value: relative (stored or potential) labor

      - relative-value potential: the relative profit potential that can be made in a particular labor type

        - this can also be framed as the potential gains added by acquiring skills/understanding in a problem space
          - low-skilled laborers cant add much profit potential in an automated problem space, but high-skilled laborers can
          - whereas even low-skilled laborers can add some profit potential in a non-automated problem space
            - low-skilled task example: "identifying problem type" (still in demand because its not automated yet)
            - high-skilled task example: "automating identifying problem type"

        - example:

          - automated labor (such as checking the chemical content of a product before shipping it) has low relative-value potential because its rules are well-understood, so the profit potential approaches 0, unless a high-skilled worker can optimize the existing solution or derive abstract problem-solving methods
          - non-automated labor (like problem-solving) has high relative-value potential because its rules are not well-understood, so the profit potential is high


    VII. Value creation

      1. automation

        - reduces the amount of work necessary to solve the total set of problems

          - example:

            - if a society has problems "find medicine" and "clean water" and someone automates "clean water", then the only work remaining to solve that society's problems is in the "find medicine" problem
            - so the people who created the "clean water" automation tech have power (can charge exploitative prices for it), unless they decide to use ethical pricing or if the tech is distributed to everyone
            - the cost of water-cleaning will likely go down long term (if the clean water tech company abuses their power, theyll eventually be overthrown unless they can create economic moats)
            - therefore the remaining relative-value potential is in the other problem space "find medicine"
            - the "clean water" problem only has potential relative value in the form of potential optimizations to the existing clean water automation tech (unless they develop automation of that automation method, such as abstract problem-solving methods, in which case the potential relative value of labor in that field is re-routed to potential relative value in the "abstract problem-solving" problem)
            - the "find medicine" problem will be where most of the remaining job opportunities in the labor market are

        - each problem type within a context has a limit on the number of jobs it can create, if labor is organized optimally:

          - optimal labor organization requires understanding, checking foreseeable impact on system context, & automation: 
            - derive rules, check impact on system, then automate 
            - derive rule-derivation, system impact checking & automation rules, then automate

          - example:
            - if software engineering labor was organized optimally, there would be very few jobs (in the thousands) rather than 100s of millions of jobs, and they would involve code automation
            - if everyone wanted to be a farmer, there would only be so many farming jobs possible (given land resource constraints), and the number of jobs would steadily reduce as more farming tasks were automated
          
          - however abstract problem types (vs. specific jobs in a context like software engineering) create almost unlimited jobs, such as:
            - incentive alignment
            - mismatch correction
            - conflict resolution
            - system analysis

          - these abstract problem types will likely have innovation potential for a while, because theyre not automated yet, as there is potential for controversy in selecting optimal solution selection methods for those problem types, given that they need to be evaluated in a system context

      2. innovation

        - offers an opportunity for disrupting resource distribution
        - uses resources in a new way that is useful to some agent

      3. efficiency creation

        - organization

          - efficiencies of scale:
            - network effects from a scaled organization, such as a large company or an automation tool allowing scaled info trades, can provide compounding value 
              - example: chat tool to ask a question or suggest an idea to many people at once

        - optimization

          - finding a lower cost solution, where cost can be: a resource cost to agents, a distance from a priority, or cost in the form of systemic inefficiency/variance creation

        - abstraction

          - abstract efficiency objects (patterns, concepts, strategies)
