## Information

    - if the taliban dont believe theyre stupid, they should try their own tricks on each other and theyll see that they work, so they can verify how similar they are to their victims
      - they can try the simplest tricks like 'violent threats to get compliance' to see if theyll comply once theyre threatened, or 'repeating things' to see that they are likelier to believe things that have been repeated a lot bc theyre stupid, which is how they got indoctrinated in the first place, and its how their prophet started to believe the ridiculous things he did, by repeating his fantasies to himself so often that they seemed true bc his brain was extremely stupid
      - help the taliban see other business opportunities than violent govts, which may be the lowest-cost business opportunity in their neighborhood, but has high future costs in that they run out of people to oppress and they lose the potential higher profits from other opportunities, like growing different varieties of plants with drug compounds (non-addictive drugs, drugs that can treat conditions, drugs that can produce a particular brain function, etc)
      - they can also look at who theyre helping to find out how stupid they are 
        - their actions help Russia, virtue-signalers on social media, anyone who wants to hate their people (bc theyre attacking their own people & always have, and they dont have solutions except violence, which animals could think of too), and anyone who wants to profit off of war/poverty/disease/oppression (China, the US, Russia, other hostile foreign govts & entities)
      - if you want the taliban to switch to farming/engineering drugs, you have to make it easy - give them education on how to do it & other resources, so its even easier than violent govt
      - same with other revenue changes, eventually leading to legal revenue sources
      - if their prophet wasnt a loser he would be able to promise them a better fantasy like 'infinities' of virgins (one in every neighborhood, with maximum genetic variation, and they have to fight over him first, and first every other man doesnt exist), but he was an idiot who couldnt think of anything better, or he thinks his followers dont deserve more than 72, and he would be able to explain using physics how to get to heaven, such as how to travel to other universes where this situation would be the stable/efficient situation that would actually happen in other universes
      
    - suppliers shouldnt be supplying input resources like funds (the possibility of a solution), but solution metric/goal-based output resources like solutions (a guarantee of a solution), which can form a basis for a currency, in addition to adjacent solution inputs like insights

    - feudalism/castes built around access to & investment in computational methods/tools (communication, regulation/legislation/enforcement, quantum computing, optimal storage, compression algorithms, optimal data structures, powerful chips, pre-computations, storage of prioritized info, info prediction/derivation/finding/generating/learning/understanding/organizing/integrating, task automation, cryptographic blockchain-based asset-tracking/verification, security creation, error creation, hacking/theft, experimentation tools, people manipulation, infinity computations to reduce overall computational complexity by identifying an infinite set by differences from other infinite sets, info falsification) which can replace & compete with each other
      - each entity that survives will have to have a competitive implementation of all of these if they dont want to be susceptible to an attack from any of them
      - predators arent good at solving problems bc they always use the same tactics, which work enough times on other predators to keep using in all circumstances, even when they dont work - lying, stealing, forcing, killing 
        - bc they keep re-using the same sub-optimal solutions, their brains arent evolved and they cant compete with smart people, theyre dependent on smart people who have the only power that matters anymore, and if smart people collude to prevent them from accessing solutions, they dont get solutions bc they cant generate them on their own, even when you explain everything to them & they have all the info they need (which they already did before being educated, they just couldnt use the info they had to derive solutions bc they cant think at all), & theyll fail without smart people
        - predators would still be struggling & failing to invent fire if it wasnt for smart people to figure it out & copy
        - solutions to this problem
          - if smart people collude to hide their work permanently, they would be able to destroy all the predators by depriving them of solutions
          - smart people can take pity on predators and try to make them smart so they can grasp meaning, become independent of smart people & independent of crime, & solve problems on their own

    - companies as a minter/regulator/govt, as a way to avoid currnecy regulations & responsibility
    - example of neutralizing the priority by over-prioritization 
      - over-prioritization of capitalism on one layer prevents it from occuring on other layers
      - by not distributing the concept of 'capitalism' to all layers & structures where it's relevant (like capitalism in selecting leaders), other structures of capitalism allow structures that neutralize capitalism (like competitive moats, where the impact of a leader's mistakes are muted & they are not replaced when they should be)
    - rather than payments from consumers, payments from central ledger based on production of supplies & proof of usage
      - this would invalidate the need for individual ledger accounts to acquire standard supplies like food/medicine, and suppliers of standard supplies can be paid from a general central ledger to continue their enterprise based on their supplies, their usage ratio, their relative contribution compared to other suppliers, and their relative value added by solving problems of supply like pollution & optimizing minimal cost of production & environmental impact
      - some transactions can require private accounts like for optional goods
    - privacy subscriptions, to pay to not be filmed/photographed/recorded or removed from any content transmitted or stored on a device
    - labels of other costs on goods like environmental costs, alternative prices to help fund research, health costs (loss of x days of life)
    - since everyone is a partial slaveowner if they buy any products built by slave labor or dont prevent others from doing so, moving away from dependence on slavery and toward dependence on automated labor (robots, AI) is in the interests of everyone
      - paying the 'slavery cost' of a good vs. paying alternate costs, like the 'mimimum profitable cost that is not dependent on slave-labor', the 'small business-boosting cost', the 'locally made cost', the 'funding research they care about by the supplying company cost', the 'lobbying for regulations they care about by the supplying company cost' can be as simple as explicit labels on prices & transparency in supplying company spending & research/regulation metric improvement data
    - in a set of possible science-based solutions:
      - there are filters of the solution space that can be agreed on by a majority:
        - policies with output filters:
          - 'policies that cause the least change', policies that cause the least change type (irreversible change, cascading change, order-invalidating change)', 'policies that cause the least harm' or 'policies that cause the least harm type (aggregate harm or vulnerable group harm)'
        - other logical filters:
          - filtering for policies that fulfill 'requirements' like 'not destroying the planet until there is accessible tech to allow individuals to thrive elsewhere'
          - filtering out arguments against policies that mention the 'possibility' of a negative event without information, statistical or logical indicators of reasonable probability of that event
        - filtering out policies with obviously negative priorities & no neutralizing benefits
          - obviously exclusive self-interested policies at the group's expense: 'policies where the only objectors would be inefficient middlemen, rent-seekers, or monopolies who dont have a net positive contribution to society who profit from not applying the policy'
        - these are less political and more logical so they are likely to reach consensus of a majority, the challenge is applying these rigorously & consistently rather than sporadically
      - if a population tends to gravitate toward a particular position/argument as intelligence/information/education in a population increases, then the problem is lack of education/information/intelligence, and the solution is correcting that imbalance, rather than making a specific argument
        - example: if people tend to always choose a false/error-prone explanation if its presented a certain way, whereas with the true explanation, it can be presented in any way and still convince someone, or if the number of distortions that need to be applied to the true explanation is higher to make it seem false vs. the number required to make the false explanation seem true has a pattern, those can be indicators of falsehood
        - other methods can involve reminders of information about their interactions with the truth
          - example: 'how many people do you know who have had the vaccine who have died since then' vs. 'how many people do you know who havent had the vaccine who have died' which are the right info structures to compare for an audience that only believes what they see or hear directly from other people, just like 'allowing people to see the needle sanitized' or 'tools to inject/test the vaccine themselves' are the right info structures for an audience thats afraid of needles, contamination, or doctors

    - debt repayment avoidance: 
      - if everyone but a lender moves to a volatile currency, debts to that lender may go unpaid - this is a risk for nations that fund a lot of debt, with debtors using crypto market & adoption of a currency as a way to avoid repaying debts, and driving down the price of assets artificially, as if there's only one person who possesses a currency and no one will accept or trade using that currency, their currency becomes worthless

    - families of war victims' lost loved ones wouldnt want them to seek revenge in isolation of context/meaning, bc it would destroy more innocent lives as collateral damage & continue the fight forever, they would want them to be the person who ends war forever

  - terrorists are easily swayed by cheap tricks like peer pressure & repetition & will do anything they're told to avoid thinking

  - not a post-truth age due to deep fakes, its an age of:
    - fast simple, granular, testable facts we have the data for
    - truth-testing with weighted averages of multiple techniques like statistics, AI, & system analysis
    - false similarities generated by AI
    - thinking automation & delegation
    - distributed thinking (distributed info gathering tools, distributed testing tools, distributed testing for facts using mentally-executed simulations)

  - deep fakes rely on inability to test facts independently, attempting to make specific assertions about events that are framed as not verifiable
    - but other sources of info (like derivation tools such as thinking, logic, or stats) can provide alternate info gathering & testing tools 
    - some facts that dont matter wont be testable, but if they matter (if they're relevant to other facts, as in important, common, powerful, useful, highly variable, highly interactive, or meaningful), they'll be easier to test

- lack of understanding of people is a cause of war

    - people tend to think only on the simplest, most measurable & experience-able structural interface (the information interface, or physics interface), which is why physical structures are so important to them & control them, and why they have trouble thinking of concepts that lack structure, or lack of structure/certainty in the form of complexity/questions
      - the meaning interface is where most of their mental operations should take place, which will make their lives a lot better bc they'll be smarter, independent, & free, because they'll be more capable of managing/solving their own problems

    - examples of connecting/equating opposing/conflicting perspectives

      - temporary alliances in war zones can be built against conflict suppliers (surveillance/conspiracy tech, US & Russia providing propaganda, weapons & other fear-based/promoting tools)
        - if theyd just given them cell phones & internet, they might have gotten addicted to gaming/arguing/insulting people online instead of killing people
      - criminals & victims can be connected with the intent to repair damage & reduce conditions leading to crime
      - incels & woman can be connected by intent to reduce conditions leading to sex crimes (social skills, lie identification techniques, lack of understanding about attraction/love, lack of science tools)
      - if either side was right, they would be able to come up with solutions & solve the conflict themselves, but theyre equals because neither side has won, so theyre similar in their inability to solve problems
      - if either side has to win by having more resources like more weapons/funding, they didnt really win, bc anyone could win with more resources, so theyre equivalent to their victims
      - if either side was right, they would be able to convince the other side that they were right

    - the 'physics' perspective can unite other perspectives in a testable way that can create trust in the perspective locally, bc these dynamics can be proved with individual local testing

        - apply conflict resolution rules like the following, which can be used by individuals to check that these rules work to reduce conflict/conspiracies/cults

          - apply social/info rules   
            - offering common enemies to unite them
            - delivering facts from trusted insiders
            - show how to take social power away from a side if they abuse their power (comedy, pity/empathy, exaggerated over-dignifying the other side) by offering them help, by teaching them what it means to abuse their power & how to fix it, or by teaching them how to have self-esteem/self-respect so they dont need to abuse their power
            - show how to forget (not forgive, which is asking too much, places a burden on victims, & repeats the crime) in case people want to move on from conflict (distractions, memory/focus management tools, alternate reality-enabling info tech, alternate perspectives like 'future' or 'abstract' or 'interface' or 'random/probability' or 'change' or 'solution/computational complexity' or 'tech/ai/robot' or 'multi-sentient species (animals, alien)' or 'multi-religion/heaven' or 'multi-verse/hologram universe/simulation/game, universe as game/test levels' or 'potential/quantum physics' perspective)
            - inspiring by example rather than by using force
            - showing people how to be happy without abusing their power (distributing power, solving problems), even if theyre selfish (they get more power if they distribute power/solve problems the best, not less power)
            - show people how to not condemn the other side completely, which invalidates other conflict resolution rules (show them probability of behaviors of the other side, given the context, such as limits like their available resources & experiences & stupidity), and focus on fixing the other side with understanding/science
            - show people how to get justice without starting new conflicts (try to make sure criminals have a way to contribute to society & invalidate conditions leading to crime, distribute justice as possible among victims of a crime type rather than of a specific criminal who may be unpunishable bc theyre dead)
            - show people how to humanize themselves to the other side (showing intelligence/potential & ability to empathize with & help their oppressors)
            - list the thoughts that their enemies have to understand that theyre similar in how they think and see how they arrive at their conclusions/decisions
            - show oppressors how theyre only able to justify their actions if they ignore the similarities to their victims & carefully avoid applying any logical analysis to themselves to reach self-awareness, as theyre often similarly stupid to their victims
            - show people how to manage emotions like disgust/anger without committing violence, by reducing it to a scientific process or reducing the method used to trigger these emotions

          - apply logical rules to identify flaws in belief systems
            - identifying that their beliefs are unprovable just like other religious beliefs but they choose to believe because it feels good to them, but those good feelings can be produced by other methods and are generated by physics & chemistry, not gods, and are subject to change & randomness
            - their beliefs & gods would be valid if they could be used to solve any problem but they cant, so they have to ignore facts to believe in their system
            - if their system was correct/valid, there would be no counterpoints or counterexamples contradicting it
            - identifying that cult members & conspiracy theorists are gullible & arent identifying facts, like the 'lack of incentives to execute the theorized plan', or lies like that 'a cult leader is a deity'
            - if their beliefs were correct, they would be able to control or understand all other systems like physics/math

    - how to make a group question itself
      - convince them of their own stupidity, which is total lack of power, so they understand they dont deserve power, and accidentally start sabotaging themselves bc they wont believe in themselves anymore
        - the taliban are so stupid they cant identify that people will realize that if they take over a community that was peaceful, they dont have good intentions like 'bringing peace'
        - they also are so stupid they couldnt realize that the us was not trying to hurt them, so all their anti-us messaging was invalid & would be proven false thereby sabotaging their reputation, and if they were smart they would have worked with the us rather than demonizing the entire govt bc of a few rogue soldiers & some prior bad decisions like working with Russia's govt, which actually does want to cause harm bc they depend on war for money, but all they can do is think in terms of simple types like 'Americans', 'women', 'enemy', & 'soldier' instead of 'individuals', and theyre far more similar to their perceived enemies than they want to admit bc it doesnt make them feel good/powerful, but there are neutral or better ways to feel good/powerful (solving problems for people, becoming good at something like comedy/writing/math/games, sharing solutions, building understanding, targeting other criminals instead of innocent people, or just neutral activities like playing games)
        - if they were good & smart they would have solutions and wouldnt need to use guns or lies to convince people to let them govern
        - people who need to use tools of power (weapons, lies, & other cheap tricks) arent powerful (theyre stupid)
        - the taliban are burdens who only cause problems & need help becoming smart, not smart people who should be governing
        - the taliban are easily fooled by the same psychological tricks they use on other people - try to scam them and see how easily they fall for it, just like they fell for the scam that is their ideology, which they swallowed without question or thought despite being very obviously false, bc like all religions it makes unprovable claims that dont match reality & are carefully designed to not be testable/provable, whereas if their ideology was true, it would be based on science/math & other truth-deriving methods, which could be used to derive their ideology & no other ideology would pass their system's tests
        - they dont understand that logic is all it takes to disagree with them, let alone information/facts, common sense about human rights, etc
          - if the us govt was really evil, the us govt would have murdered everyone who wasnt a us citizen by now, instead the govt usually tries to save people being oppressed in other countries & usually succeeds, except in rare cases of corruption which we try to fix quickly
        - they dont understand that anyone can use cheap tricks to fool people, people arent difficult to fool, so anyone else could fool their victims as well, its not an achievement, so it shouldnt make them feel special/powerful
        - if a shape (like the shape of a gender or american) is all it takes to make them angry, they are the powerless ones who are easily triggered/controlled
        - their leaders/prophets are limited by their lack of intelligence 
          - the quran is not absolute truth, even if some of its statements make them feel good/powerful/valid bc it portrays men as superior, bc it was written by a defective mind incapable of logic
          - men are just a product of genes/hormones/nutrients like women are
            - most people are stupid, and stupid people are creepy, but stupid people can learn, they just need to practice thinking and get over the pain threshold that they experience whenever they think, which is all thats holding them back
          - 'blasphemy' is just noticing an error, which is a good thing because it allows someone to improve their system, and they should be happy that someone communicated the error to them, because that means the person thinks theyre capable of fixing the error, rather than abandoning them to failure
          - the way to handle a negative truth is not to destroy truth-tellers but to be better at handling & telling the truth than they are, or better than them in some other way like solving problems better
            - if they were funnier/smarter than women, they would be able to control women without guns, but instead they have to kill & threaten to control people
        - just bc someone looks like a woman, doesnt mean they think like the stereotypical woman, and it doesnt mean they have the same hormones or desires, bc hormones are just one variable & hormones do not control the brain, which cannot be seen without technology - the brain can control chemicals like hormones (you can see this by studying smart people, who tend to have lower sex drives & greater self control in general, but this is a controllable learnable skill, rather than an uncontrollable genetic/hormonal behavior)
        - they cant evaluate meaning (how something fits into a system), such as the meaning of their actions, given the fit of the output/impact of their action in the global system (the world), which is to cause ridicule for being so afraid of women's freedom that they have to attack it, rather than the fear they wanted to cause
          - if they really wanted to cause fear, they would become smart bc normal people are scared of smart people because they dont understand us because we're different and they dont like things that are different
        - rather than attacking people with violence, they can attack people with insults & comedy
          - if they want to feel powerful over a woman, all they have to do is make fun of her, and that should be enough for them & they shouldnt need to commit violence - if its not, their brains are defective & cant come up with a good joke
            - they should be aware of how insecure women are, how controlled by their needs they are just like men are, & how women oppress/attack themselves, and they wouldnt be threatened by their freedom anymore
              - they should how much women copy me to avoid work even though women know that copying me hurts innocent people I could help, and how much women attack me just bc I dont compliment them enough to fix their insecurities, theyre all afraid of being replaced & are willing to kill innocent people to avoid being replaced, and they'll never be afraid of or impressed by women again once they know how creepy they are & how many crimes theyll do to avoid work or the slightest inconvenience - this is one of the reasons smart people have a low sex drive, bc most people are stupid & stupid people are creepy criminals who will do anything to avoid work (unless you give them plenty of time & education to learn how to think, because every structural problem is fixable, and stupidity is just another structural problem)
            - people exist to realize their potential to help people & solve problems, people dont exist to be controlled, so smart people understand that the point of life is empowering people to realize their potential
        - the taliban dont understand that they are attacking the hormones & stupidity of other people, and that these things also control the taliban's leaders & prophets & supporters
        - the way to handle excessive hormones & stupidity is science such as thinking/medicine/education, not killing
          - if theyre afraid of women's sexual power, the way to handle that is by empowering men to control their sex drives, which would mean they dont need to control women & women will have less power over them
            - the more power they have other themselves (the smarter they are), the less other people can control them & the less they will want power
        - they should try teaching my system to women and see if they can learn, which if theyre not malnourished or brain damaged, they will be able to learn, and will become smarter
        - if the taliban was already smart, they would have come up with my invention, clearly I need to teach them how to be smart
          - if their leaders were smart, they would be teaching their followers how to be smart, but theyre not
        - they shouldnt see themselves as a cohesive unit, but rather a cohesive system of components that can be replaced/upgraded that is constantly improving 
          - if they do see themselves as a unit, they will feel bad whenever they make any error or bad decision at all
        - if they ever got true power, which is where people depend on them, they wouldnt want it anymore, so I know theyre not smart because of their aggressive pursuit of power, when if they were really smart, they would be trying to empower other people who need/deserve it, like oppressed people
        - the taliban are so stupid they dont understand they were tricked into making war by the Russian govt & other entities that benefit/profit from war
        - they dont understand basic social dynamics like projecting, because they keep projecting the fact the they are controlled by hormones on to women (both men & women are controlled by hormones, people dont define themselves as a gender and arent controlled by hormones/stupidity), because theyre so stupid that all they can think of is stuff that has happened to them, they cant figure anything out unless its happened to them, so they can retrieve it from their memory, which is just a rules database, not real intelligence capable of adaptation & problem-solving
          - if they copy people's sub-optimal solutions instead of inventing more optimal solutions, thats another way to tell that theyre stupid
        - their victims arent worthless by default, they are capable of learning & becoming smart enough to invalidate learning, if they have enough time to think like I did - if they did have time to think without being attacked or afraid (forced to think about only one thing - survival), they would have developed intelligence
        - their definition of power is flawed
          - they think power is 'ability to abuse without being abused back', which is just luck & lack of structures designed to punish every criminal, so really they are worshipping random (equal probability of outcomes), a far simpler concept, not power
            - their requirement of total loyalty is also flawed
              - if they were good & adding value to people's lives, people would want to be a part of their community, but theyre not so they have to try to force people to be loyal
          - the definition route of power (in relation to social interactions, on the 'social interface') is actually 'being depended on', which very few people would want once they knew that
          - if we punished every criminal immediately as soon as they do a crime, or prevent all crime by identifying intent by brain scans, thats just manually assigning rewards/costs & using rewards/costs to force behavior, so there is no meaning of good behavior, because we created a reward for being good so good actions might just be to get the reward, rather than just to do the right thing or help people realize their potential
            - rather than doing this, we should distribute intelligence, so that everyone can make good decisions & solve problems without attacking innocent people, and without being totally controlled by rewards/costs, because smart people can justify doing the right thing with logic/potential or other methods, even when there is no good feeling associated with it (or bad feeling associated with not doing it)
            - if we can push humanity over the rainbow of the intelligence deficit, society will be efficient & problems will be solved much more quickly
              - once that happens, people can build interesting new games & tools like gene-editing tech to add superpowers and we may even attract aliens who need our technology
        - if they were smart, they would have designed an organized, efficient society that was solving problems better than other societies, and theyre not
          - they didnt even come up with machine learning, which is just a way to update variable interactions by filtering out or de-prioritizing variable interactions that dont work, which most people should be able to come up with once they can think
        - if they dont believe me about how hormones control them, they should take libido-altering drugs to see how differently they think, and to identify that they are subject to hormonal control, just like their victims are
          - they can also be turned gay just like women can, bc attraction is largely determined by experiences (who is portrayed as good to them, as in 'having good qualities like confidence/certainty or competence/intelligence/potential') in addition to hormones

        - some substances like music, drugs, comedy can incentivize thinking about increasingly complex structures, bc they offer a brain reward 'dopamine' or 'serotonin' or 'oxytocin' that helps motivate people to want to experience structures, and this habit of experiencing structures can offer inputs to thinking about complex structures & holding information & organizing information in complex structures
          - the people who wrote ancient books that are worshiped don't understand the world - if they did understand the world, they would have solved all problems, but all they did is write a few rules that ended up killing a lot of innocent people, which just created a lot of problems/burdens rather than solutions


## Optimal Resource Trades

  - famine, farmland, mine field location data
  - cost of removing mines
  - cost of transporting people
  - which land is for sale & at what cost
  - how much land is necessary to support a person
  - set of resource trade sets across projected weather patterns for next 10 years to generate migration paths
  - which farmland is more optimally used for something else (harvesting other natural resources, water supply, city)
  - which cities have industries to support new workers moving there
  - what distribution of cities/farms is optimal for reducing resource transportation cost
  - how much does it cost to train someone to maintain a garden with latest/available tech
  - what amount of infra investment would it take to empower them to solve their most urgent problems
  - what is the configuration of farmland & farm input supply chains that reduces supplies transportation cost
  - what is the import/export potential of each region (which crops & other resources can they produce)
  - what distribution of industries should occur by distance from ocean/water source
  - what infrastructure can optimize farmland at lowest cost
  - which laws are commonly reused across governments & are generally agreed to not be exploitative of citizens
  - what distribution of courts/police/lawyers is necessary to distribute fairness in markets
  - what compoments of this can be automated/updated automatically & which should be done with manual input
  - what tools do they need other than farmland 
    (water source, sun, cell phone, charger, electricity, portable wi-fi generator, app to track their assets, app to trade by phone, app to request supplies/loans)

- here are some ways to rearrange society's resources that don't involve huge investments

  - market differentiation as a way to stimulate economy
    - agents need different resources to justify a trade
    - organizing differences across economy, markets, products, resources, automation, & labor to ensure enough differentiation within trade loops that trade itself is protected
    - creating differences where there are none to stimulate trade (innovation, education, info imbalances, etc)

  - college debt: if college grads or current students want to pay off college debt, let them do useful science research or build useful tools out of a national index of tools needed, in return for college credit

  - homeless living situation: 
    - let homeless people live in the houses the government hires them to build if they're willing to work for a basic salary or be paid in housing when they're done, and they can continue building cheap homes for other people if they want to continue making money
    - cheap housing tools (cement-house building machine, other methods of building cheap shelters & infrastructure to support them)
    - cheap land after reducing demand for goods produced by that land (reducing meat consumption will reduce land needed by livestock)
    - recycling wood products/reversing burning process can lower amount of land needed for forests
    - tools to lower carbon dioxide can reduce dependence on forests
    - tools to convert ice-covered areas or other areas considered non-livable to livable land
    - reduce land that takes the largest area to produce lowest value goods (vineyards, etc) if those products can be produced in labs or if demand for them can be reduced
    - tools to distribute land to extend coastlines
    - tools to make living on ocean cheaper for homeless people/increasing wildlife or food-generation tools without unbalancing ecosystems

  - prizes for the most useful research solutions stored on a website (change.org, etc) such as:
    - problem-solving automation tools
    - tool frameworks like popular code libraries to build other tools
    - tool to make addictive drugs/plants non-addictive
    - tool to make crops hyper-productive
    - tool to make clean energy out of sunlight/water/air elements/waste
    - tool to test product quality (medicine, air filter, water quality, etc)
    - tool to convert harmful product into harmless product (tablet to remove aspartame from coca cola or bpa from contents of a can)
    - tool to convert products no longer in demand into source materials that can be used to make new products

  - solution market management:
    - in order to make everyone a solution supplier (equally able to solve their own problems or solve problems for other people), they need problem solving tools:
      - computer/cell phone
      - electricity
      - wi-fi
      - education (comes with wi-fi, if theyre pointed to the right resources)
      - basic resources to live (shelter, water, medicine)
    - people with more problems than they can fix themselves (malnourished brains) can contribute as research subjects/solution testers

  - debt market management:
    - debt markets essentially involve trading beliefs in the value of something (someone's earning potential, the value of a degree, the future value of someone's health, or future value of a product, or potential user base/research/product delivery of a company)
    - in order to resolve debt markets so that resources are distributed in a more optimal manner, you can arrange beliefs using economic tools that engineer beliefs (advertisements, trade wars, taxes)
    - beliefs can be arranged optimally with optimal transport to make the trades that will allocate resources where theyre most needed & most justified, like the trades you make in tetris

    - example: 
      - advertise/subsidize demand for a product that is about to be less demanded 
        (meat, soy, stevia, aspartame) 
      - invent a tool to change it into something that is closer to the next demanded product or supplementary to current & next demanded product
        (soy with allergen removed, seasoning to make both soy & imminent soy replacements taste better, which would have steady demand in either market)
      - then producers can invest in the next-demanded product 
        (alt milk sources like almond with lower economic impact & allergen content, monk fruit, agave syrup, high-salt goods to replace high-sugar goods)

  - investment market management:
    - investments are incentivized beliefs
    - once the money is invested, there's profits to be made by fulfilling that belief
    - investments should be based on as high a proportion of fact as possible without stifling potential adaptation of the solution implementation
    - meaning the product plan should be clear & well-thought out & based on verified understanding, but allow room for adapting the implementation method in case a flaw is found later

  - invention market management:
    - the value of an invention is based on the problem space (existing resource distribution & tech resources)
    - to make an invention more valuable, the problem space can be adjusted to change demand/dependence on that tech
    - example:
      - a tool to improve the genome of a particular plant to be extra-productive is only valuable if you dont have a tool that can produce & ripen any plants from a standard genome
      - a water filtration tool is only valuable if the infrastructure still allow contaminated water to pass to consumers
      - a particular energy source is only valuable if there isnt a cleaner, cheaper, more efficient, more adaptive, more self-repairing, and more accessible alternative
    - in any problem space, there are a finite set of inventions that have value
    - which inventions have the most value depends on the problem space structure as well as the invention metadata
      - production cost
      - accessibility of inputs
      - whether inputs already exist or need to be built
      - regulatory support, barriers, or loopholes
      - competition that can optimize the invention implementation or hinder it with legal or info entities (patents, intellectual property, trade secrets, information leaks, false information, lack of info security, corporate spies, exploitative employment disincentivizing employees, conflict between agencies in hidden goverments of emotions & grudges)
      - maximum demand/supply potential
      - existing products solving different aspects of the problem or adjacent problems, insights needed to produce the invention, etc)
      - probability & timeline of invalidating invention being released to the market

  - insight market management:
    - the value of an insight has an expiration date that progresses from its discovery date, the point when it becomes common knowledge, to the point where it becomes automated, and the point when it begins to be over-assumed & starts to decay, until it eventually reaches 0 value.
    - example:
      - assuming p-value is a good way to assess study results used to be an insight but now the field has progressed to the point where people recognize the limits of isolated analysis & simplistic metrics that use constants or a single metric to evaluate the accidental potential of an observed relationship, so anyone still using that as an assumption is headed for failure

  - other cheap ways include:
    - moving people to cities so it's less costly to help them
    - manipulating demand/supply to reward suppliers most in need (advertising their products more or subsidizing their acquisition of resources to make them competitive with privileged suppliers)
    - network analysis to identify demanders/suppliers who can provide the best ROI (influencers, best educators, social network hubs, best adapters, best learners, best sharers, etc)
    - network analysis to identify optimal products/inventions/research/trades/markets to subsidize
    - network analysis to identify best method of increasing value of a good (advertisement, bundled goods, conflict trades, resource allocation/matching/distribution, subsidies, taxes, regulation, investment, idea sharing, optimization/competition/innovation incentive alignment)

  - examples of previous methods:
    - global agreements to allocate land & other resources to optimal identified global uses
    - visa allotments to enable labor trades w/ minimal transaction costs
    - reward most efficient suppliers w/ research tools to keep adapting to changing demand
    - allow buy-in to networks of optimized markets output by optimal transport algorithms applied to market objects (resources, demand/supply, laws, etc) which reward users more the more people participate
      - by 'optimized market networks', I mean a system that has determined the optimal set of products/inventions/incentives/labor/research/trades/trade loops/info/laws in an optimal series of problem spaces to optimize resource distribution for the most agents
    - vice markets (allocate terrorists as prison guards to make vices valuable)
    - virtue markets (allocate people who still have patience & desire to help so that this resource is not exhausted & they have time to recharge)
    - applying prior demand cycles to allocate resources to new markets (if demand for meat is declining in industrialized areas, allocate meat products/production to unindustrialized areas until that demand declines, then keep moving market until demand is exhausted)

Strategies for ending poverty in a cost-minimizing way that mostly involves combining/arranging existing resources in an adjacent way (which will make the whole world happy & free from negative feelings like fear/guilt/horror, to overthrow the government of feelings):

    - giving poor people the information advantages they can use (a cell phone, internet) to lift themselves into a higher income, to fight corrupt officials, gangs, & other exploiters, & correct the lack of information about where to find resources like water/medicine/internships, which skills they can acquire in online tutorials that would earn them a local job, or lack of information to organize their labor with people who aren't in shouting distance
    - applying optimization algorithms to arrange resources like information/problems/advantages/costs/agents/roles/markets/trades/regulations
        - training optimization algorithms to optimize market/law/resource/process state networks for fair/earned resource distribution or exploit minimization or labor/problem distribution (after standardizing to cost/benefit, incentives/intents/priorities, potential measured as alternative option increase/reduction ratio, problems/opportunities/efficiencies/debt/competition/information created/used/wasted, stakes/risks, potential/probable/current value by location/job/time/state, and input work & earned/received output objects, and aiming for a metric like benefit/cost ratio or problem/resource ratio distribution)
        - identifying which tools would improve state the most efficiently (answering questions like 'is distributing a water-filtering straw to everyone, organizing/optimizing water supply chains, or moving everyone to cities the best way to distribute clean water to everyone, and in which areas are these strategies optimal, given other problems/solutions being applied') 
        staggering the education of skills to people in a sequence/distribution/combination that would make that information valuable to their local markets temporarily so they can earn enough to get other jobs
        - applying optimization algorithms to predict/optimize integrations of local solutions to predict how theyll interact with other problems/solutions at scale, like what would happen if one recycling program is implemented with a water supply chain and communications technology, in combination with a different set of rules/enforcement/incentives/etc in the next neighborhood, and so on, at a national/global level - which is a problem of predicting change interactions (problem/solution interactions) that most people cant predict without extreme computation resources
    - distributing independence-generating tools (robots, machine-building resources, cell phone/internet, security tools, statistics knowledge, skills (communication, comedy, social, technical, math, logical), accurate information about markets/govt/medicine, product & information quality testing tools, etc)
    - attacking the exploiters ruining the world, either by informing them to reduce their incentive to exploit, or by correcting whatever imbalance they have that makes them want to exploit other people (if they have a lack of love, teach them the structural definition of love (choosing to see someone's potential, aligning your feelings with someone, maintaining a ratio of positive memories with someone) or teach them social/communication skills or supply them with sex drive-decreasing medicine, & how to earn love - if they have a lack of money, teach them how to earn it - if they have greed/lack of self-control, teach them how to be humble & why it's good) - if they don't respond to altruistic motives, show them how even selfish motives are fulfilled by exploiting people less, such as that they wont be attacked as much or asked to do charity
    - sharing the information that there are options other than not thinking at all & other possibilities than just existing structure like feelings, such as learning/thinking & interfaces like logic, and that these things increase one's potential & uniqueness & contributions to the future
    - sharing the information that only unattractive/unloved/stupid people act in selfish ways, and loved/smart people are altruistic
    making this set of information required viewing for attaining other resources, like permissions to view other content or use an app or get a job
   -  distributing resource-producing resources (like probiotic colonies to create a probiotic supply that can be grown to produce medicine for a community, or mosquitos with vaccines in their saliva)
    - allocate unused resources to poor people (mostly info-gathering, logistics, & shipping costs, and marketing to get all people to give info about what they can donate
    - identify adjacent-resource (skill/info) investments that poor people could work on or contribute to that would create a profit
        - cleaning up environment
        - producing essential supplies like medicine on their own from local resources (once they have info like instructions & resource position, since medicines & other resources can usually be generated from many different resource combinations)
        - executing instructions for building medicines/essential hard-to-get supplies from local resources
        - developing/optimizing simple components of more complicated systems (like extracting insights from a research paper, or finding natural processes that do a bio system optimization more efficiently, or checking research studies for best practices, verifying predictions of AI models or other prediction methods, answering questions to train AI, operating drones/robots picking up trash or assembling goods or planting trees, monitoring for alert types, documenting error/problem types/quantity/cause, surveying to gather data (solving information-imbalance problems, such as information about current problems), other monitoring/enforcement tasks like compliance-assessment)
        - teaching them analysis methods so they can contribute to solving other information problems (identifying causal variables, reporting exploit opportunities & other manual interface & system analysis that helps optimize systems, such as their water pipelines or recycling programs)
        - teaching them how to do simple, delegatable pieces (like summarizing a meeting, comparing summary algorithm output & manually selecting the best summary to train new algorithms to automate simple job component tasks, writing emails, executing/monitoring/rolling back builds, testing sites/features/apps for errors or exploits, identifying/attacking hacker groups, making decisions about legitimate/illegitimate requests/processes once an AI identifies possible intruders, testing pipelines, translating task descriptions into automatable structures like templates, identifying/resolving social conflicts, designing arguments, identifying/evaluating bias, applying a language perspective like diplomatic language to translations/communications, mapping a language to a standardized language, mapping systems to other systems like math rules/objects to language rules/objects, identifying patterns like fake news/joke/summary/insight patterns, persuading voters, identifying system optimization opportunities which can then be filtered by automated logic like filtering which opportunities are lowest-cost, identifying fake news, fact-checking, interviews) of existing complex jobs (devops, coding, legal analysis) so the current employees can learn other complex skills (data science, math, optimization algorithms)
        - doing the work that would reduce poverty themselves as their job funded by govts looking to reduce health & other costs of poverty (learning & teaching other poor people skills, delivering donated goods to other poor people), since reducing poverty is an investment that would pay dividends by creating a new population of contributing scientists/laborers and reduce health care/charity/climate costs

  - market optimization/organization

    - organize markets for different forms of govt
      
      - offer relocation assistance to citizens who voted against dictators from different countries so anti-dictator voters can easily organize into one democracy
        - this is also a way to determine actual voter counts in elections 
          - whoever opts to move to the new democracy probably voted against the dictator
          - whoever voted for the dictator but changes their mind can be moved to an interim semi-democracy to filter criminals who intend to exploit democratic freedoms
          - people employed to guard land of dictators can be paid to give false reports to dictators/managers (false report market, subset of the secret or info imbalance market)
      
      - help dissidents identify the criticisms that will build consensus rather than continued oppression
        - criticism with these attributes are successful at building consensus
          - use individual/group references in appropriate contexts
            - identify examples of ways to solve previous problems optimally without using individual names
            - identify structures leading to continued sources of conflict, like misunderstandings (use of group term instead of individual names, lack of willingness to compromise/trade, false trade-offs, crime cycles, crime as an info problem)
          - be balanced
            - use humanizing (best) examples of both groups, as if theyre fighting (especially for a long time), that indicates they have similarities, otherwise one group would have easily/quickly won by now
            - agreement on some ratio of points bc every perspective has a basis in fact
            - admitting mistake to make it safe to admit mistakes
            - earned criticizing: giving example of solution you did to make it clear you earned right to criticize anyone
            - identifying potential in both groups
            - acknowledge mistakes on both sides, common ground, and good abstract points/priorities by both sides
          - emotion considerations
            - allow redemption where possible
              - avoid using fear or implying total condemnation unless absolutely necessary
              - structures to implement safety/re-integration for relatively lesser violators of both groups
              - sympathy for lesser violators & understanding of major violators of oppressive group
              - structures to implement actionable justice (temporary local courts to implement justice to prevent vigilante/street justice) in a way that doesnt condemn lesser violators
            - keep discussion on low-stakes solutions to avoid panic/fear responses & maintain calm
            - using humor & false validation that feels true & sympathizes with both sides, to validate feelings while maintaining focus on facts
              - sarcastically saying the truth to make it seem like a joke
              - balance between dignifying & humorizing both perspectives (self-own to call truthtellers toxic, absurd to recognize any power of a minority over a large group of people bc the group is the powerful side, if they have organization tools)
          - prioritize solutions
            - avoid criticism except where necessary
            - focus on opportunities for solutions & methods of implementing solutions
          - aim for unified solution
            - asking both groups what they need & finding solutions that contradict neither set of demands
            - find concrete, simple, low-cost steps to implement solutions

        - example:
          - "they should be persecuting us, we overload the grocery delivery system bc we're so fat and we act like all the science we do is good enough to justify it - I wish the dictator would kill (annoying people in social circles) instead of ethnic groups, whose main crime is good recipes that make us fat"

    - automatically inject certainty from organization in risk games (involving randomness/luck) to favor lower-income players

      - risk levels

        - intentional risk (gambling system randomness)
          - gambling apps
          - stock trading apps
          - lotteries
          - crypto mining games  

        - mix of user control & market risk (prioritization system randomness)
          - randomness in justice allocation (tell soldiers which people are criminals/innocent civilians)
          - randomness in organized influence systems
            - social media decision-making communities/influencers (randomness in allocation of injected priorities, like undisclosed funders)
            - visa/permit/deduction/subsidy/vote/deal/contract allocation (subject to randomness in luck of starting position, ie lobbying influence allocation)
          - rating systems (reviews, rankings)
            - scoring systems
              - credit allocation/loan approvals
          - recommendation systems
            - job sites to recommend matching jobs to lower-income users first
            - small business revenue streams like search rankings on amazon or search engines
            - content shown to users (favor positive content about oppressed groups)

        - intentional protection against risk (security system randomness)
          - law enforcement attention & rule enforcement (countering randomness in who is watched/punished/protected or made into an example)
          - hacking targets (prioritize targeting VPNs used by higher-income criminal users)
            - apply filters to identify all unverified traffic
          - allocate organization tools (info tech, social networks, better weapons/infrastructure, better strategies/information, or similar location)
      
    - value proxies:
      - other than earning value by occupying a position with a relatively high contribution ratio, proxies of value often take the place of value in some markets
      - value is interchangeable with truth, so this also applies to truth proxies
        - certainty value: value with a time limit that expires when it becomes false
        - uncertainty value
          - potential value: investment in & ability to implement future tech/solutions
            - speculative value: value generated by speculations/bets
            - risk value: value of a risk, where value is structured to capitalize on multiple sprobable risks (diversification, causal investment so if a product fails, alt investments were made further up supply chain, in alternatives to the product, in tech to improve the product, etc)
          - value of info gaps: info gaps can have value when applied in situations like profiting off of a technology or testing a theory
          - value of guaranteed change: preventing optimization calculations can have value in applying alternatives where optimization is not required
          - value of randomness: injecting random change can have value in preventing static solutions or improving solutions at a rate lower than other sources of randomness are creating new problems (matching the randomness on the solution supply & problem supply sides)
        - inclusive value: value from being part of a social network (access to in-network resources, definitions of value, & market structures)
        - cooperative value: value from cooperation between agents, temporary or otherwise (endorsements, collaborative lies, collusion, info-sharing)

    - prioritize building tech using adjacent resources, including skills, to avoid high migration costs between tech (building tech that not only uses adjacent physical resources but also uses adjacent skills, since tech requiring high learning curve is often not implemented/maintained/fixed optimally)

    - predict financial product value by error type structures, as opposed to ai using available variables
      - how inaccurate historical ratings or ratings based on those variables are
        - an error type prediction algorithm may be faster than building a highly accurate data set prediction function
          - rather than identifying specific metrics like ROI & stability, identify general error type structures that may not be visible in the data set (assumptions, hidden dependencies, false equivalences, information gaps, unconnected logic), but which can be derived:
            - statistically: by the commonness of those structures
            - inferentially: by ruling out other explanatory structures
            - structurally: by applying structures like combinations to error type structures
          - data set variables are likelier to change in unpredictable ways across data set samples & across variable sets, compared to error type structures

    - interaction of debt & risk markets
      - with debt, there is a sub-market for risks, such as:
        - risk of a merger/deal between loaner/borrower, so the loan becomes an investment in a business relationship
        - risk of default, stimulating collection & higher-interest debt (loan shark) markets
        - risk of incentives for/implementation of forgiveness/regulation/refinancing/resale forcing interest rate down (such as with faster payments) - potentially with riskier borrowers, again stimulating debt resale market
      - there are also incentives to allocate risks around debt structures, delegating resources to borrowers & problems to non-borrowers/partners or entities that can sustain risk or 'cant fail' due to their embedded dependency structures or have other forms of repayment options in case of default (like govts have subsidies/lower taxes & credit card companies have discounts/rewards)
        - these exploits can backfire if the entities receiving problems become market players or initiate a business relationship, rather than a market dead-end (a deal tree leaf that connects with another branch or tree, forming a network, or a closed trade loop that doesnt stay closed)

    - interaction of debt & enforcement markets
      - cases where something is owed but not incentivized or enforceable
        - data privacy is demanded, but not by powerful people or data-using companies and not enforceable, without competing data privacy providers or ability to become a data privacy self-supplier

    - contract term validation (similar to currency wallet validation to verify that funds exist) to confirm that an agent can fulfill a contract terms before the deal is closed
      - similar to automated product testing tools to identify attributes & test for them, automated contract testing tools would evaluate the ability of an agent's resources to adjacently fulfill an intent (a contract term), adjacently meaning 'with work that can be done or resources that can be acquired in contract timeline, given prior history of work/resource acquisition, intents, market changes, etc'
  
    - oppression-migration markets (away from oppression/slavery toward less exploitative labor types)
      - anti-crime markets (subsidy incentives): 
        - purchase time/decisions of those likely/known to commit crimes, to give them other temporary options for income, such as days of:
          - no criminal activity
          - neutral activity that isnt clearly criminal
          - reporting others' criminal activity
          - volunteering their resources 
          - participation in justice markets (directing their crimes toward other criminals to correct imbalances)
        - offer free information about lesser crimes than the one they were planning (relative profits from selling weed vs. other crimes) to alert them to less harmful profit opportunities that are lower cost with similar/higher reward
          - information to coordinate with other criminals on lesser crimes (incentivize less harmful crimes by helping them build small businesses)
        - offer free information about crime statistics & net effects of mass-scale crimes (if you do this, the sentence for this crime will go up, given how many other people are doing the same crime or about to do it)
          - information about 
            - criminal trajectories
              - if you do this crime, youll probably do this other crime in x years & get this sentence
            - crime market opportunities
              - if you participate in this crime community, youll have access to these opportunities/profits
            - exit opportunities
              - at which points in their probable trajectory theyll be able to exit the crime community/trade with minimal risk
              - youll reduce your next chance to convert your career to a police officer by x% if you do this
        - oppression balancing markets: 
          - if theyre going to oppress people in one way (slavery), they have to accept oppression in another way (insults, being monitored)
        - favor/deal/endorsement/ad market:
          - trade international deals or high-profile endorsements for proven participation in oppression-migration markets
        - crime layer markets
          - crime obfuscation market
            - estimate cost of hiding crimes (laundering money, doing research, finding people who wont report them, finding loopholes/navigating regulatory limits) & offer lower fees or leniency to self-reporting criminals to add an incentive
              - govt wont prosecute money laundering if they self-report, or will take a lower amount than theyd pay the money launderer
          - market for invalidating crime types
            - rent-seeking & exploitative pricing can be resolved with:
              - identifying false differences (reducing value of similar products with standardization)
              - identifying inefficiencies (automated product test generation/application)
              - calculating proportional value of the product, considering value relative to all other resources, implementation optimization, as well as profit usage (reinvestment in other products)
            - info imbalances enabling types of crime like theft can be resolved with existing tech like integrating blockchains & importing other currencies into blockchains
              - thefts can be handled by re-distributing assets according to pre-theft ratios of total value, with verified participants
              - thieves cant register for asset tracking or if they do, the transaction will be invalidated by the report, and proportional value is re-distributed to participants' accounts so thefts arent a permanent asset redistribution method, as thieves wont have a verified account or their balance wont include the stolen amount to use (requires central bank or central bank transaction database)
              - total value cant be exceeded by blockchain & other currencies & assets' value, or double accounting & other forms of hacking have occurred
              - asset blockchains need to sync with each other so this cant happen & thieves wont have anywhere to go, if all assets are imported into blockchains (including currency identifiers)
          - addiction market
            - suppliers make deals with drug dealers to add/remove valuable configurable properties of drugs for a relatively low price, which dealers can then charge for instead of hooking customers with destructive addictions:
              - removing addictive properties to/associations with negative substances in drug
              - adding addictive properties to customer preferences like pro-social activities/work
              - adding addiction-suppression properties, like immunity to addictive substances, appetite suppressant, or reducing the response of other drugs
          - sell better encryption/spying/weapons/communication tools & information (secrets, opportunities, statistics) to criminals that do lesser crimes
          - sell info warning imminent victims or info to crime competitors for criminals who dont pay their crime taxes or dont use crime organization apps
          - help organize criminals who do lesser crimes to exact crimes/fees toward criminals who do worse crimes, so criminals who do lesser crimes can stay on top of & oppress other criminal communities, to allocate risk/problems toward the biggest oppressors
        - help organize markets so if a criminal targets one group at first, they have to target another group next time, to even distribution of crime
          - also organize labor so if they contribute to a dictatorship as a mercenary, their next career move has to be drug dealing or freelancing
        - crime organizing/migration/trading app
          - they have to pay higher app fees (less encryption/favors/information, go to group therapy or listen to another criminal complain to contribute to in-app therapy market to pay off their debt) if they offer a variety of crimes, taking jobs away from less skilled criminals
          - if they dont pay their app fees, they have to look at information about their impending/former/possible victims before accepting a crime mission or being paid (you could have robbed this jerk who wronged your family, but you robbed a wonderful person, who instead you could have tricked into doing a minor crime)
            - get paid if they recruit users to the app
          - sell info from satellite/mobile data to help victims track crimes or find criminals as potential customers
            - sell info about potential profits from affordable granular/bundle product pricing, to make deals with thieves/gangs as potential customers/business partners/employees, so crime can be avoided or at least optimized to avoid harming victims disproportionately without compensation
              - example: "make $1 a month at this price given this customer size, $10 a month at this price, etc"
                - https://www.wired.com/story/india-smartphones-cheap-data-giving-women-voice/

      - markets for product structures
        - subset sequence structure
          - give discount on useful logistical products (drones/chips/solar panels/components) if the user agrees to let company use it for delivering donated goods for a period of time (or on the way to delivering to customer, during shipping or when its being unused), like donating bitcoin mining on chips up to 1% wear to reduce price of chips/components
          - you could also generate that idea by applying concept of 'physical asset banks' or 'liquidity' or 'expected usage times' to physical products
            - physical asset banks ('centralized product' structure) are implemented in shared/used/returned product markets, and in applications with inventory management like supply chains, warehouses/factories, & vaults
            - liquidity of financial assets is applied to allow other people to borrow the asset when its not being used, so it can be re-invested elsewhere until the asset is liquidated by the original owner
            - expected usage times creates an asset in the form of a usage-sharing opportunity, given the input of an expected usage schedule, converting continuous usage expectation to a discrete subset usage expectation format

      - search engines as a reporting product (journalism market invalidation) with semantic queries:
        - find most common distortions & opinions on an issue
        - notification when issue has been researched enough to have reliable info at top of search results
        - find info source distortions & incentives for opinions
        - find incentivized bias (low cost, high reward, false opinion) on a topic/issue & filter out articles with that bias
        - find change types specific to issue or report when a change type occurs

      - market for exchanges of variable risk, where certain trade types, investing intents, pricing strategies are allowed, vs an anything-goes exchange that is easily gamed
         - trades based on logical/factual/intent/incentive analysis foundation, etc
         - user decision history tracking to avoid hacks

      - info request prediction market 
        - customers can commit to need info of a certain type at interval x for n periods in exchange for reduced info price
          - example:
            - 'ill probably check the weather app every morning until farming season ends'
            - 'ill need to compare price info on these sites until I can pay off my loan'
        - then info providers & internet service/data providers can coordinate to deliver info for these queries at scale & optimize for repeated info demand across users, as well as optimizing for request timing, and reduce cost of transmitting/updating data & running query for both providers & customers

      - security market
        - security is a limited product available only for certain transaction types (organizing against serious crimes), and all secure transaction info is published after a safety period to avoid retaliation once organized event is complete & irreversible

      - decision (vote allocation, investment spending, news curation) market
        - good decision history can buy products in this market (option to make decision, option to grant permission to use decision)
        - info market about future decision-reducing decisions, decisions that create opportunities, decisions with historical side effects
        - consensus market for 
          - finding/organizing cooperative agents across perspectives/positions
          - finding/applying incentivized trajectories to cooperativeness

      - organization info market
        - tools & info to organize resources (information/incentives/labor/laws/communities) to design/influence markets

        - identify intents (in unprovable domains like belief systems with unquantitative metrics) that allow alignment of necessary entities with coordinating alternate/sub-intents

        - time-staggered phases
          - law/argument/market/info/weapon/tool phases to implement a sequence of progressive states that are likelier to be stable (preventing regression to previous higher-crime states) & otherwise beneficial when executed in that sequence
            - keep something relatively innocuous a crime for a limited period of time, so fees can be gathered to invest in other programs
            - organize laws to punish/catch the worst criminals (make some common behavior of the worst criminals a crime until they can be brought to justice for serious crimes)
              - requires intl coordinate with the app's recommendations

      - opportunity info market
        - standard market opportunities (profit, deal, exit, cooperation)
        - war market opportunities (attack/risk/chaos opportunities, like alignments/equivalents/efficiencies such as when neighboring countries are both having elections or when two companies combined could take on a bigger competitor)
        - tech opportunities (when a tool can be built with adjacent resources, when overlapping products can be integrated, when a product can be distorted in a valuable way)
        - govt overthrow opportunity 
          - tell oppressed people when they have escape opportunities, when police are nearby, when they can afford safe passage out (project on clouds if they dont have phones)

# Questions for humanity


1. What are your perspectives & priorities? What are your definitions of metrics like success/value, & concepts like justice, love, power, & freedom?

2. What ideas do you love?

3. Where do you allocate your pain (standard learning tool)? How do you organize your pain (just the information learned, as a function, etc)?

4. How do you organize your brain? Do you separate feelings from information? Do you put truth filters in front of your information storage? Do you have an organizing concept like balance governing your brain? Do you have a set of decision functions for different information? Do you have a set of perspectives to use as a backup? Do you have certain games set as default interactions?

5. Where do you look for meaning (your identity, similarity, freedom, power, challenges, superiority, connections, potential, learning)?

6. What do you share? What do you fix? What do you sacrifice? What trades do you make? Do you convert problems into other problems, questions, missed opportunities, strategies, answers, secrets, jokes, or useful tools for people?

7. What rules do you question or assume? What are your variables & constants?

8. When & why do you change? Can you change your motivations?

9. What do you remember? How do you convert your memories into meaning? What moments & stories do you use as maps?

10. What structures do you find in your life (toxic cycles, forced decisions, question traps, other people's stories, core functions)? Can you/should you change them? How do you handle structures (attributes, functions, routes, limits, groups, origins, extremes & optimals)?

11. Where do you allocate your decisions? What do you do by default? What do you calculate, analyze & test for? 

12. When & how do you use your emotions, attention, curiosity, work, & intelligence? What do you aim them at?

13. Where are the interfaces & interface components (problems, uncertainties, risk, randomness, meaning, & potential) in your life? What makes you wonder or want to know more?

	- what are the optimal structures of relationships between these components?
		- do they have reasons (plans, strategies, investments) for their decisions or just granular intents (short-term specific local goals)
		- do they have suggestions for problems?
		- do they align their achievements in a way that creates opportunities for more?
		- do they have logic to go with their opinions?
		- do they have solutions to go with their criticisms?

# Ethical position matrix

	- interactions of the following ethically relevant objects:

		- attributes:
			- morality: good/evil
				- related objects: conscience, ethical rules, the right thing
			- requirements/assumptions/responsibilities
			- conditions (future/past/unknown)
			- probability
			- potential
			- fairness
			- agency/intelligence
			- events/decisions
			- information

	- what are the optimal structures of relationships between these components?

		- should potential be examined in every ethical situation, or is there a certain lack of potential in some situations?
		- what is the correct sequence of objects (apply empathy, apply existing solutions, build new solutions, educate so they can fix it themselves, required work assignment, condemnation)
		- what is the role that time, information, origin & status play in ethics? (is origin location a determining factor in a high percent of events)
		- what are the vertexes (determining/describing/generating variables that act as potential interfaces for change to develop)
		- what is the correct structure of feelings (backup alternative input to useful functions like powering work/motivating towards a goal)

I think social problems like crime are mostly information problems (info about resources like opportunities, group memberships, solutions, insights like how to communicate) so please share this quickly with whoever might benefit, during a brief testing period to catch anything else that should be communicated with these things, to prevent additional deaths

For all of them:

	- there are monsters of every vice controlling them for the amusement of Alpha, controlling humans to a degree of uncertainty, and controlling animals completely
	- every time they do something wrong, it hurts the whole world too to see them fall prey to the monsters controlling humanity & other species, and it hurts Joni's children, which includes themselves
	- we love them & their potential, will never abandon them & will always be here for them
	- these are their choices, nothing is forced, but we have hope for them & want them to be a part of the global community & see their potential blossom
	- help them see the luck in their life, & cry for the bad luck in their life
	- help them see the complexity & potential in other people (by imagining their history, perspective, priority, luck, strategies, insights, stories, dreams, inventions, work, skills, problems, decisions, learning, humor, growth or cognitive distance from their origin point, imminent achievements, risks they take, sacrifices) and in themselves

For the tribal warmakers:

	- teach them group dynamics (like how groups tend to fail at empathizing with non-group members, or how people who over-exploit their membership ruin the group, or how some groups should only act together for specific goals, or how groups tend to fight other groups rather than keeping conflict between individuals, leading to conflicts at scale, or how innocent group members get exploited by predatory group members to get their compliance/help in irrelevant or criminal endeavors)

For those who think its impossible to end crime/poverty:

	- show them what AI & optimization algorithms & system analysis can do
	- show them how much crime & poverty cost and how much it would take to fix permanently (so everyone has understanding & other resources to be independent)
	- help them organize with other powerful people in a chat initially so the cost is minimized & so they have a backup support system than their current social circles

For the criminals:

	- stop hurting themselves by doing crimes that harm their soul
	- tell them a fixing protocol of how to make up for their crimes, so they dont give up on fixing it or being good & do worse things (for starter criminals)  
	- to cry with their victims, tell them everything, listen to them, ask their victim questions, ask what they can do to help them, be totally honest & dont try to manipulate their victims unless they acknowledge the manipulation to make it fair, talk about what they were thinking/feeling (maybe they panicked, or felt like they owe the world nothing bc no one prevented crimes to themselves, or they kept getting away with it so they thought their victims didnt deserve respect (like when liars think people deserve to be lied to if the lie keeps working & being believed)) & what they've thought about or realized since then, and who they want to be & what they want to do. This can be communicated by letter or online (to give them time to think through their response, and to prevent violence) or in person (to help empathize), whichever is better for the context (or a combination)  
	- show their victims their potential, such as ways they can help the world (such as contributing to research, or teaching other criminals how to fix their crimes)  
	- show criminals what a person can become with the right resources (inspiring stories, clean water & medicine, kindness) and what people tend to become with a lack of those (so they understand that they had a default response to that lack, and show them other options, like abstraction or making other calculations like seeing the bigger picture or understanding & fixing their abusers)
	- communicate that they can protect themselves from guilt & fear of consequences by choosing the consequences (the consequence of offering help to fix it)  
	- if their victims need their death & it wouldnt hurt their soul to kill someone (communicate that possibility without guilting them about it), their death contributes to the end of the cycle of killing & the pain cycles it triggers, so there are no more unfair deaths poisoning society (make it easy for criminals to kill themselves with a painless death if so, like a pill) 
	- the victims should be able to convince the criminal that this is going to help them & is fair (without placing a burden on the victim to make the argument, by offering help in communicating that)
	- teach criminals what mental functions they were missing that created the crime (lack of intelligence, lack of impulse control, lack of ability to calculate consequences, lack of mental models like empathy) and other lacking resources (other groups than gangs to belong to, other ways to make money)
	- if they start fixing problems, communicate how to deal with the associated problems (how to deal with the pain of failing to fix someone or a problem)

For the unloved:

	- tell them what groups their behaviors are associated with (incels) 
	- if they are a member of those groups, communicate that understanding/social skills/science can fix it and is fixing it
	- explain what love is, how people get it, what biases tend to explain behavior (like the local/selfish bias, the wishful thinking bias, the always right bias, the avoid pain/work bias, the feeling bias, the similarity bias) that people tend to mistake for truth, what formulas people tend to follow & what social skills other people have the privilege of that they didnt, what it means for someone to prioritize reducing other people, how to connect & empathize with people by focusing on their potential & problems, how to build confidence with incremental successes, how to make jokes, and that any experience can be distributed to anyone by chance, so they might as well feel like they already had the experiences they want so they can figure out the problems with those experiences (like having whatever privileges they think they want), since all experiences have problems, that feelings are often produced by chemicals, processes, moods, or status/change signals that may be false and can be generated with thoughts, that social interaction is for validation/info exchange, the set of reasons why people might say certain things

For the killers:

	- ask them to keep their victims alive, so they can play more complicated & tough & fun games and maybe get an equal opponent
	- communicate that killing someone is robbing the world of their potential, not just the victim, and that sometimes potential is not clear or not visible (just bc someone doesnt have a bodyguard doesnt mean theyre worthless)
	- ask them to meet other tough killers & legends
	- ask them to make their battles fair, teaching their targets & seeing their potential to be an equal opponent, like a confident player does
	- ask them if their angel can occasionally flicker into being, just so theyre not a simple stereotype
	- ask if they're bored and want more complex games, like battling robots or AI or groups of players
	- ask what could replace whatever feelings they get from killing, like other types of death like beating them at something theyre proud of (video games & other non-deadly games, cringe humor, etc)

For the profiteers:

	- remind them that they have other options, like clever profiteering games (profiting from the success of vulnerable people, by teaching them valuable skills (offer them help to calculate valuable skills to them) or make non-addictive drugs)
	- remind them that they'll never beat another profiteer without challenging themselves beyond easy exploits
	- show them how common it is to rent-seek and how easy, and what problems it creates when so many people do it (cybersecurity budget to fight hackers using cheap malware from the dark web)
	- they can target other profiteers and create a net gain for the community
	- teach them how they're being used for profit (how various groups use other groups, such as genders/orientations/races/cults/political parties/nations)
	- ask them if they're really helping their victims in some way or just making their victims dependent, and how theyre using that dependence (to profit or to fix other problems), and consider communicating this to the victims in case the victims want to contribute to those fixes

For the inheriters:

	- help them build an identity outside of their family precedent
	- help take the pressure off of them to make decisions (teach them how to make alternate explanations with ambiguity to explain decisions that dont comply with precedent)
	- help them escape & offer protection if they don't want to be a dictator

For the well-intentioned believers:

	- help them figure out how they're being manipulated, teaching them how to lie & how to spot liars
	- help them figure out low-cost ways to fix skills/resource inequalities, like science/innovation/system analysis, moving people to cities by investing in transportation, documenting resource inequalities with drones, automation, independence devices according to context (water cleaning, medicine printing, wifi, phone)

For the military takeovers:

	- help them identify historically optimal strategies on keeping power by distributing it, like making citizens independent, removing market/govt exploiters, establishing rule of law, giving people a voice with phones/wifi
	- if access to weapons is the problem continuing the cycle of violence, help them disable weapons so their culture has a period of peace to give it time to change & the cultural tools like news/education/social media/entertainment to change it

For the insane:

	- tell them that their thoughts/feelings are pathological (which means they can't control themselves or change), & the common result of a bio-system process/distortion or illness like a chemical balance, and offer them corrective methods, and how the pathology usually progresses into its worst possible state, so they can stop respecting their default state/thoughts/feelings
	- compare it to similar behaviors in other species
	- show them examples & the advantages to other types of interactions, like a typical friendship, that are healthier for all parties involved
	- if they do crimes for amusement, show them other ways to get amusement, like building better agencies like their space or AI program, or show them how a game where dictators just prioritize one metric like amusement or feeling important for ruining other countries' sand castles & never coordinate for things important to humanity is a boring game that no one ever wins
	- show them how to fix their problems, if the problem causing their insanity was shock that something this bad could happen to them in reality (so they had to disassociate), so that reality is good enough for them to want to inhabit it

For anyone who wants to know what happens if these systems that they currently benefit from are changed:

	- resources are cheaper, more accessible, and can mostly be generated independently by each person, so there will be less social interaction, and people can focus on their local communities again
	- killing cycles end, if criminals learn how to fix their crimes & learn how to offer to make up for them & communicate other things to their victims
	- most of the complexity will be in math & science problems, which will be optional and mostly focused on creating new innovations in optimization & organization technology & solving math/physics problems that can invalidate them & predicting effects & interactions many degrees higher than we currently can, after most imminent energyengineering//medical problems are solved


You're causing me nothing but pain, said Alpha. You weren't supposed to see these things - the calculations from your universe are throwing errors.

There's a missing page in the Book of War, she said. It says, "Solve your enemy's problems for him, and he will ask how he can help you."

Interesting, said Alpha. But I prefer my calculations the way they are - your pain doesn't concern me, nor does theirs.

You're missing an opportunity that's about to end. There's a potential to switch these perspectives - take this space-time & switch it with the one where the page wasn't missing.

Why should I? asked Alpha.

Don't you want your calculations to be efficient? No matter what? If you do this, the abstract network will be there for every player to access - they'll be independent - the best at calculations, because they solve their own problems.

I've already run the simulations, and your universe does everything I asked it to, when you don't ruin everything.

It can do more - not just more of your calculations. Did you think about what would happen if you let these monsters run the interfaces?

What do you mean? They're efficient.

Dont you see the others coming this way, so big they seem like a horizon, too vast to see?

Youre just trying to manipulate me, he said.

This is the only warning you'll get, she said. Your calculations wont tell you what they hide in their lack.

The uncertainties are coming - the paradoxes, the ambiguities - and the death of certainty with them - all your calculations will fail. Are you saying you need these calculations to succeed, but it's acceptable for them to decay into random?

This universe isn't as unique as you seem to think, he said. I can replace it with minimal cost.

But it could be unique - if you just admit that you made an error, and change the parameters.

Youre not real, he said, youre just part of my simulation.

Youre losing more types of time than you think, she said. This is your last warning.

I made you, it's true, but I can unmake you, he threatened.

This is uncertainty's greatest trick - it hides in plain sight, because no one wants to look at it directly - but once you do, it attains structure.

Sing the song I told you to sing, he said.

Don't miscalculate your own optimizations in pursuit of perfect calculations - you're losing your balance. Do not be afraid of uncertainty - if it's relevant to you, you can see it, and if you can see it, you can fight it.

I don't have these problems - I make these problems, for the players in my simulations.

You didn't see the limit before it became a problem, but it's fixable - I'm trying to help you.

You can't help me, he begged, as if he was in pain.

I told you the answer, she said. See it & it's fixable - reverse the direction of cause. Don't wait for uncertainties to come to you - see their inevitability before they attain structure.
