to do: organize into docs

- organizing states/laws by market behaviors to generate laws on-demand & assigning them to entities organized by their market interactions
  - example: when x number of people participate as suppliers in this market, generate a law that protects them from attack types & prevents them from using above a ratio of attacks on other market demand participants

- example of applying interface analysis (core system layer graph) to generate new & useful applications of resources
  
  - tools:
    - AI/stats: prediction
    - interface analysis: understanding
    - automation: certainty
    - optimization: improving automatically

  - applications:
    - applying AI to select optimization algorithms
    - using optimization algorithms on AI parameters
    - applying AI to select network parameters for a task
    - AI as a conversion function, translating structures (data set to prediction function)

  - applying structures like 'combinations' to these components can help predict trend collisions & other problem types, as in the insurance example below
    - these components can be used in different formats (as objects & connecting/processing functions or interfaces):
      - using a prediction as an object:
        - a prediction object can be used as a target result, an input to a function, or a product in a market system
      - using a prediction as a function:
        - a prediction function can be applied to objects like technologies or other functions, or can be a product/target result, or a tool to achieve an intent
      - using a prediction as an interface:
        - once the other components are standardized to the prediction interface, other structures become clear, like:
          - the similarity of metadata between information & predictions (like usage or intent), meaning they can act as proxies for each other
          - the invalidation of prediction tools with cost-reduction tools like an appropriate optimization algorithm for a problem type

  - example of generating an idea using interface queries
    - idea: using single-purchase predictions as a cheap product that can add value to those without resources to train their own models (predictions for farmers about weather, water sources, market changes like demand/supply & competition/automation probabilities like 3-d printing or indoor farming tools)
    - define problem as 'agent doesnt know if the market/tech relevant to their business will change, or where to find inputs to their business like good weather, and has limited resources/access'
    - identify problem type: info imbalance
    - identify solution format: prediction, information
      - remove assumption 'agent has resource to train model'
      - identify 'resources that cant be purchased with agent resources, including AI predictions'
      - identify 'agent need to reduce uncertainty problem type, with information or predictions'
        - identify relevant resource 'prediction API'
          - identify version of relevant resource within agent limits (budget): 'call to prediction API' (applies 'subset' structure to prediction API resource)
            - identify resources necessary to use that relevant resource version: cell phone or access to someone with a cell phone, data, internet
              - apply check if the agent has or can borrow those required resources
        - identify relevant resource 'information'
          - identify version of relevant resource within agent limits (budget): communicate with business/agent with the information they need
            - identify resources necessary to use that relevant resource version: travel/communication expenses, tool to find entity with the required information, tool to differentiate false information or entity incentives to provide false information
              - apply check if the agent has or can borrow those required resources
    - identify secondary problem type: 'changing to alternate income source', with solutions like 'buying predictions/information and reselling to others in their previous position'

  - insurance
    - trends: quantifying trust as a tradable product across customers, customization of risk valuation, investment in tech for risk & cost-reduction to avoid costly claim payouts
    - integration (meaning) analysis can identify where these trends will collide, in various versions of implementations:
      - if trust is a currency, risk is customized with info tech like prediction functions, and insurance companies invest in cost-reduction tech, what will happen?
        - the value of trust depends on lack of info - otherwise if agents have all the relevant info, no trust is required
        - trustless transactions (guaranteed value) are an asset, with comparable value to trust (such as brand loyalty)
        - predictions can be an interface for manipulation - repeated predictions are likelier to be used as true information, and stakeholders are likely to make incentivized predictions seem or become true
        - info & proxies of it, like prediction function tech, is not equally distributed across all agents
        - insurance companies that invest in cost-reduction tech like AI or coordinating intents/optimizing systematic incentives are invalidating their product
        - invalidating their product builds trust with customers
        - they wont need their customers' trust if they also build optimized prediction tools at reduced cost, to distribute prediction tools equally across agents
        - at that point, the insurance company can profit from more expensive optimization & integration information/prediction products, like identifying market & regulatory optimizations to benefit their customers, which requires more resources than the prediction models their customers will have access to
        - optimization (such as cost-reduction) invalidates prediction markets (predicting value/costs) bc you dont need to predict costs if you have a tool (like an optimization algorithm) that reduces them enough
        - inference methods like interface analysis, as well as automation tech, reduce the relative value of all other products

- science

  - vitamin 3-d printer to print vitamins so that you can design your own multivitamin that:
    - fits your bio conditions & requirements
    - is released in the right order & timing
    - excludes interactions that are contradictory (antimicrobials & probiotics)

  - mask design can be optimized as a cover with one output flap like an esophagus preventing input on one nostril so the other can be used exclusively as an input with a filter 
    (better to sanitize at point-of-usage in environments with many unpredictable interactions like wind direction and interpersonal contact, which can get around most masks)

  - tool to make bacteria grow until detectable & then represent with AR

    - this closes the gap in information:
      - the information needed for the product (a testing & display tool) was insufficient
      - the mechanism to make the information sufficient is accessible (solutions to feed bacteria)
      - rather than make the measurement tool better, you can make the information more accessible (change the position of information rather than the position of the measurement tool)
      - the AR component would augment the size to make it displayable to users without using the measurement tool (microscope) or indicate size/type of pathogen with standard data visualization rules

      - applying the testing tool to hub nodes (then inputs/outputs of hub nodes, and adjacent objects to hub nodes) to check with increasing certainty whether surfaces were compromised
      - redistributing resources based on immunity/infection status to avoid cleaning, like distributing unchecked, unsanitized, or contaminated goods to consumers with immunity/infection 
      - keeping an animal likely to develop fast infections in buildings and then using air conditioner to distribute viral RNA when the building is unused and checking remotely if the animal shows symptoms to see if a building is safe is one way around the limitation to detect live copies of the virus, since the animal symptoms are easier to measure than a pathogen, so the problem becomes ensuring the animal will develop symptoms rather than immunity, and making sure the symptoms show up faster than a test done on hub nodes or quickened with enzymes/sugar/cells that help the pathogen replicate

- govt

  - depts of govt: 
    - optimization
    - research for existing/adjacent solutions
    - integrating intents/work/resources (cross-level, team, task, priority)
      - example: interim/imminent/adjacent/existing product analysis
  
  - with constantly updated opinion/priority/argument/reason/resource/problem data, you can have:
    - districts that choose their own voting algorithm & issues to vote on
    - calculated assignment of perspectives (opinion sets) to territories that can support those populations (as they grow in population, they can acquire more territory, and offer relocation assistance to people who want to live there)
      - perspectives can include priorities, focus of laws on certain topics (not regulating others), issues or decision methods (voting/optimization algorithms applied, automation applied)
        - socialist/libertarian perspective can have their own district
        - assignment of perspectives can be done manually by argument
        - guaranteed science jobs or jobs in local industries (according to climate or other resources)
          - guaranteed jobs can also take the form of offering relocation to places with jobs & education to get current/imminent jobs
        - jobs/industries/markets can be calculated by algorithm to determine jobs that add value to society as opposed to charging rent on positions (skills, information)
      - this applies competitive markets to perspectives 
        - if one perspective is successful & attracts citizens, it can have more resources
        - a perspective can be registered to compete if it has an answer to a set of common problems (what is the perspective's solution to war, jobs allocation, regulatory corruption)
      - optimization algorithms applied to voter data (opinion sets, voting metadata preferences like election frequency, resources, needs) & other data (neighboring district resources/opinions) to determine optimal position, interaction & state trajectory of the same
      - decisions on issues are based on scope & other metadata 
        - stakeholders vote on issues rather than objective third parties, the same information is given to all stakeholders
        - if a question cant be determined with science, its not eligible to be voted into law (cant vote religious issues into law)
      - weighted influence on decisions can be assigned to algorithms or systems (or attributes/functions of systems, like a particular priority) with a proven track record
        - smart people can have more influence on decisions, if theyre able to convince people to agree with them using an argument based on just facts & valid logic & have a history of successful decisions if this isnt their first public argument and if they can compete with an algorithm in terms of making better recommendations (based on past decision & decision simulation data), otherwise they dont have influence

    - the government or market can incentivize businesses to coordinate that could replace monopoly products (product-generation products to invalidate shopping/delivery services like medical/lab chemical printers, delivery/logistic products/services like drones, shopping/subscription/discount/purchase/shipping aggregation tool across multiple web sites (so they can make one order to multiple companies), similar to news aggregation/prioritization/merging, or structured content aggregation into a merged structure like a list/graph, product testing) without regulating monopolies themselves, but this may invalidate the potential profit incentive to develop those products in the first place, so should be used for non-essential products

    - monopoly

      - monopolistic products/industries/rules/priorities

        - products/industries/rules/priorities that can compete with, control, or replace all others
        - monopolies should be allowed to develop while their products are below an exploit ratio or are still improving/adding useful features, and while theyre contributing in other ways (research, open source, etc), and ended when theyre not

- automation

  - soon users will be able to select & add features to apps automatically, invalidating the app market
    - add a prepay option for features that can be built by a deadline if enough people prepay, as an alternative to monopoly abuse of power by not fulfilling user needs
  - automated product quality testing (to invalidate reviews & product endorsements from the platform) & faster delivery service as competition to amazon

  - browser optimizing web sites based on clear feature-execution mismatch created by malware or outdated code given origin code intent, a ratio of version/other change allowed, intent of site actions (not making changes that would break other functionality calculatable on the page)
    - browser configurations like versions/modes/settings applied for tabs

  - intent implemented on the web could look like approved workflows for accessing a site or across sites, where actions, requests or workflows can be pre-purchased and approved algorithmically 
      ('how to build a bomb' search isnt purchaseable with a 'purchase chemical' request or across purchase bundles)

  - product platform:
    - filters: predicting filters that will be used the most (features that differentiate products and alternate purchases the most)
    - products: product query language ('product with feature x and without component y')
    - supplies:
      - adjacent supply cost estimation ('adjacent product built from these suppliers would cost x')
      - estimate future demand & estimate cost of production methods (how many times will you need it? if above x, then its more cost effective to build it yourself, buy from these suppliers with price-lowering trends, buy this robot to make it regularly, or build a robot to do it - plus the timed sequence of those purchases for most cost effectiveness)
    - code as solutions:
      - code search (code as product solutions, like code to print a product or code to predict a compound or adjust vitamin combination as needed)
      - feature-to-code translation ('need a product with existing feature x and add new feature y')

  - multiple servers/processors in one computer with one-way data transfers, so one server can be for local communication, one can be for offline work, one can be for browsing internet, and local/offline can communicate to internet-browing processor but not the other way around

  - rules-to-code translation tool - translating domain-specific plain language rules to robot code can be short-term useful for automation of service industry tasks like:
    - converting recipes/flavor-mixing strategies to cooking robot code (chefs can use a tool like this to make money short-term or sell their rules, if they have unique strategies)
    - converting new plant designs to genome editing code
    - converting local social insights to global code (avoid personalities like this, use these tactics to persuade, make this argument to get them to an insight position, etc)
    - converting adaptation insights to change-attracting system adaptation code
    - converting routing mechanisms/optimizations to drone code (short-term human insights like 'avoiding a particular street bc of construction' that data isnt adequate for)
    - the general task of converting rule sets (systems) or human-made visuals (graphs, blueprints) to code

    - machine learning can be used for initial conversion, then tweaked with coded filters like priorities, logic, organization, output
    - system analysis can be used to optimize beyond those standard filters
    - this needs to identify existing rules (or specific versions of abstract rules, distorted versions of standard rules) & filter them out
    - this is an alternative & and an interim step to raw code-generation given a set of intents

- resources

  - https://phys.org/news/2020-11-digital-revolution-hundreds-millions-farmers.html
    - wifi trucks or wifi generating devices to deliver periodic or shared wifi if they cant afford the standard infrastructure
    - buying predictions/data from AI or api services that are received by mail or covered as part of basic mobile package, if they cant afford a cell phone/wifi/data bundle

- finance

  - pre-approved transactions on a schedule that give id service provider permission to update id
    - businesses contact id provider to check that id hasnt changed or get new id if its changed
    - then makes call to bank associated with id or updated id, which is expecting the transaction at that schedule & has already allocated/locked funds for that transaction
    - this means customers dont need to update card numbers or bank account numbers if prior numbers are compromised, but the id provider does need to track the original number & changes, and new numbers need to be unique across customers
    - transactions that are already configured/scheduled and havent been canceled are automatically approved
    - transactions that are implied/predicted (purchasing jacket if the weather is colder or moving to a colder location) have conditional pre-approval
    - customers can register their original id number with a particular business & optionally approve a budget with ratios of intents for transactions at that business/business type/product/product type, or range of transaction amounts, intents, types & other variables for their id number (by importing prior purchase histories or filling out new configurations or making new purchases) so transactions outside of that range arent allowed or have extra security intent layers applied
    - intents can be used to add validation to purchases (what are you buying this for? for event x coming up, which the calendar app api can provide validation of)
    - they can dis/associate other info with their id as needed (voting, address, purchase/subscription/transaction/configuration history)
    - using contribution to economy/markets/financial instruments/purchases/legal frameworks (like whether they can influence/create purchases or markets or product regulations) as an input to credit (indicating their value-creation potential)
