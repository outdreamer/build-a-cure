# investment analysis

	- to do:

		- gather & assign cost data

	- priorities
		- the goal of each market is to invalidate the market, rather than to maintain dependence of consumers on suppliers

	- concepts

		- information

			- information is a tool that can create, stimulate or invalidate markets, as well as the idea of demand
				- an agent with perfect information or perfect derivation tools has control over markets, but may not have a reason to trade given their position
				- false or incomplete information can also act on markets, in the form of sales/marketing, staggered innovation, investment incentivization, etc

		- permanence

		- resource trajectory 

			- whats the potential of a given resource
				- what is its interaction space with possible actions & resource combinations with system contexts like tech & demand

		- independence
			- independence invalidates markets and should be distributed in markets that are providing basic rights (health)

		- value creation
			- forms of value creation include innovation, efficiencies, opportunities

		- trade structures

			- what side effects of existing trades are there
				- lack of resource distribution
				- lack of efficiency creation
				- lack of permanent or useful value creation

			- what trade structure combinations are optimal to invalidate a given market
				- what combination of trade loops, markets, & incentives can invalidate a market the fastest

		- market for markets (including market objects like demand, trades, cash flow, currency, etc)

	- attributes

		- coordination
		- robustness (permanent price reduction or independence generated)
		
	- functions

		- market functions
			- stimulate demand/supply
			- incentivize
			- regulate
			- substitute product or product components

		- purchase resource

			- info 
				- prediction/promise/risk/condition

				- value generator/store/destroyer
					- currency as a value store works because it provides a standard interface to trade on, which is a similar position as language in an info market (which most products can be standardized to)

				- government product like subsidy, law, agency, vote, tax

			- product
				- input/interim/end product

		- create resource (market, function, product)

		- standardize resource

			- what happens when you translate a product into an information product?

				- translate a product like 'laundry detergent' into a set of info products, like:
					- the tests to run to check product quality
					- the chemical formula & synthesis method of inputs
					- the place to buy inputs & in what quantities & with what quality tests (including machines to synthesize it)
					
				- the product is now a program (buy inputs, run synthesis instructions, test output, apply product in context where it's demanded)

				- it can also be allocated differently on a system level (calculate which context this product would be demanded in & likelihood of those products, then allocate resources to make the product when a trajectory toward those contexts is measured)

				- the algorithm to identify these demand contexts can also calculate instructions to avoid those contexts (to avoid needing laundry detergent, follow these instructions or buy these products) based on system metrics like energy use

				- ultimately the question is not 'how to allocate products according to consumer need' but:
					- 'how to allocate calculations to fulfill system (community) needs'

				- after you translate it to other questions like:
					- 'how to standardize product to information interface'
						- which sets of instructions generate this product or its alternatives or invalidators, with which metrics

					- 'how to allocate product inputs according to demand patterns'
						- how to minimize supplier-to-consumer difference to generate independence & reduce demand for market trades

					- 'how to design infrastructure around an allocation algorithm that can change its input parameters like interfaces & metrics'
						- given supply pipeline fragility & chemical-generating technology, which interfaces should this algorithm standardize information to & what infrastructure supports the range of possible calculations

					- 'how to allocate investment in algorithms based on resource state' 
						- given tech to create chemicals from air, what calculations are optimal & which instruction-generating algorithms should be run
				
			- when you standardize products to the information interface, you can more clearly calculate which algorithms to invest in & optimize (allocation algorithms, instruction optimization algorithms, supply chain optimization algorithms, calculation algorithms, metric-identifying algorithms, system fitting algorithms, etc)

	- example alternative combinations

		- strategy: 'buying adjacent independence-generating products'
			- investment: purchase vaccines, laptops, & clean water generator

		- strategy: 'building distant independence-generating products'
			- implementation: building machines to generate independence-generating products

		- strategy: 'buy infrastructure'
			- implementation: make transportation/energy/wifi costs lower so people have increased access to existing resources
			- investment: subsidized public transporation or energy format or public wifi

		- strategy: 'reduce cost of independence-generating products or their inputs'
			- implementation: invest in making computer parts cheaper, optimizing supply pipelines, automating health research, or educating people about derivation tools so they can do it themselves

		- strategy: 'distribute information across economy with optimization algorithms'
			- implementation: tell people what skills they should acquire to get a locally valuable position, tell businesses the best local suppliers & customers to transact with

		- strategy: 'organize labor across economy with optimization algorithms'
			- implementation: organize markets & labor to reduce work or increase market trades across all positions

		- strategy: 'combine strategies, in their optimal strategy network positions'
			- implementation: allocate competition/coordination (to resolve questions of property rights or optimal implementations), risk (problems), bets (investments), promises (insurance, contracts), value (secret vs. shared formulas/insights), interfaces (currency, ratings), markets, information & investments in their optimal positions (markets to re-allocate resources, competition to optimize, information to create markets, etc)
