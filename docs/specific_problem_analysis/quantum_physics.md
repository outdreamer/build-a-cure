# Quantum physics

  - entanglement occurring from:
    - rotating around a symmetry
    - finding nearest unused/unentangled particle
    - same interface network query (same position in a system)

  - finding how to reverse historical filters (great filter) could reverse the initial filter, or create same starting conditions to go in a different direction, looping around to initial filter
  
  - examine a universe without differentiation (every particle containing universe has the same starting resource point & limits)

  - examine when randomness can masquerade as entanglement due to limited options of core function interactions due to the system development being in an initial phase

  - information organized by relevance & efficiency

  - useful for computing attribute & variance flow as well as flow between flow of energy into measurement delivery 
    (optimize energy distribution between particle position/spin attributes according to measurement limits)

  - look for new objects in inter-system physics - as an object occupies a current & target system as well as the space in between that isnt classifiable
    - what physics apply between systems (space-times here)

  - examine how info is being destroyed in black holes & in quantum physics - is this a process that can be used for encryption or is the info irretrievable?

  - scale transitions

      - give example of emergent effects of phase/scale transitions across threshold values that exert more variance than systems can hold

      - quantum scale transitions as delegation of information to optimal/efficient/low-energy positions
        - appears to be in multiple positions until it determines which position is more efficient or easier to maintain
      
  - quantum => info => energy dissipation:
    - when quantum superposition resolves into information, which resolves into efficiency & energy, how does it cycle back into enabling additional variance (more quantum uncertainties)
    - theres an element of dimensional collapse/compression/removal involved in these processes, releasing the variance from the structures that store it
    - the dimensions of potential in a superposition collapse into information about particle attributes
    - the dimensions of information collapse into energy, which can collapse into efficiency (path of least resistance that achieves an intent) if combined with enough other efficiency pathways
    - examine the pattern of high dimensional objects appearing to have lower dimensions at various points of measurement
      - this is similar to alternate paths producing the same output from the same input
      - as variance flows into various dimension sets, the overlap of output with other dimension sets is less likely but not impossible & may occur at predictable intervals,
        like how integers have more limiting attributes than numbers in between, so boundary physics applies to integers & they can act as a filter
    - examine when emerging attributes cant be contained within a space & leak into others
