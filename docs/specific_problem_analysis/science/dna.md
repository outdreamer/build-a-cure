You just need relevant system rule info:
- inflammation causes pain
- prostaglandin signal pain info to the brain & promote inflammation
- prostaglandin depends on PTGS enzyme
- aspirin (C9H8O4) inactivates PTGS enzyme by acetylating it with a covalent bond of its acetyl group
- aspirin is an acetyl group paired with salicylic acid, which is an anti-inflammatory
- when acetylated using aspirin's acetyl group, PTGS produces lipoxins, which are also anti-inflammatory
- acetylated molecules are more transmissible in a bio-system & reach the brain quicker

find system_rules of type="bio" where effects like ("anti-inflammatory", "deactivate=PTGS")

the function to merge these insight rules into a single insight vector pointing to aspirin:




Terms:
	Nucleobase: a nitrogen based compound. Purine (A & G) combined with Pyrimidine (C & T) form complementary base pairs (T & A, C & G) that connect the two strands of the helix & form double/triple hydrogen bonds between the amine & carbonyl groups on the complementary base pairs
	Nucleoside: a nucleobase and a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose)
	Nucleotide: a nucleoside and a phosphate group, which participates in metabolism by delivering energy formatted as nucleoside triphosphates to processes using energy like: making amino acids, proteins & cell membranes & parts, moving the cell & its parts, dividing the cell, etc. 
	Nucleic acid: polymers composed of nucleotide monomers. Carbon-based earth life depends on nucleic acids, proteins, lipids & complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides).
	Nucleosome: a unit of packaged DNA wound around 8 histone proteins, found in chromatin & used to pack DNA inside the nucleus while allowing access to it
		- nucleosomes are placed in position to form chromosomes which adds another method of regulation to ensure correct gene expression
		- when the covalent bonds of histone proteinss in the nucleosome are modified, this information may be stored as epigenetic info
	Histones: alkaline proteins which are the primary proteins of chromatin
	Protein: chain of amino acids (possibly where the amino acids have lost atoms in the process of forming bonds)
	Monomer: unit of polymer
	Polymer: molecules composed of many repeated monomers
	Moiety: a chemical structure formed by covalent bonds, which governs the functionality of its host molecule's chemical reactions
	RNA: a nucleic acid with one strand that helps code, decode, regulate & express genes
	DNA: a nucleic acid with two strands, given that DNA controls growth, development, functioning, and reproduction processes, does cancer have a function that maps these general process categories to their corresponding regions of DNA so it knows where to look for gene functionality?
	Gene: a region of DNA encoding a functional RNA or protein product
	Transcription: first step in gene expression where a piece of DNA is copied into RNA
	Gene expression: usually produces a protein but can produce other things like RNA
	Promoter DNA: triggers transcription of a gene. An example of hosting a solution to a problem related to a process (like timing the off switch push) in the byproduct of that process, such as how the byproduct of gene expression (like lactase) eats the resource enabling the gene expression process (lactose): 
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(genetics)
	Enhancer DNA: increase the likelihood of gene transcription/expression by advertising the gene with activator boundary proteins, & are not necessarily located near the DNA to be expressed, found as far as a million base pairs away. Enhancers can target specific genes through cooperation or can work independently and their sum effect is evaluated elsewhere in basal transcription machinery
	- topologically associating domains (TADs) are sets of physically adjacent genes when the DNA is uncompressed & may be cooperating, so these associations may be used by cancer to change which genes are expressed. Enhancer & promoter DNA interactions don't usually cross TAD boundaries; when TAD boundaries are changed, mutations can develop bc enhancers & promoters interact with new partners, which can impact nearby gene regulation. The protein CTCF & protein complex cohesin help govern TAD boundary formation and transfer RNA (protein synthesis) and house-keeping genes also frequently occur at TAD boundaries.
	- replication domains are sets of genes that are copied at the same time during cell division, & are supposed to be the same as TAD regions
	- Mitochondria: energy hub of cells
	- Nucleus: contains & protects DNA and regulates gene expression 
	- Nucleolus: cell's response to stress, cell signaling, building & processing ribosomes
	- Ribosomes: perform protein synthesis (translation), consist of ribosome subunits to read RNA and large subunits that link amino acids together using covalent (electron sharing) peptide bonds to form proteins
	- Peptide: chain of amino acids monomers linked by covalent amine bonds
	- Translation: protein synthesis

Insights: 
	- common mistake: categorizing assumptions as facts
	- It seems like cancer is able to detect all of the dependencies of a particular function and categorically develop methods to target each of those dependencies until its able to disable the function.
	- A gain-of-function mutation (like of EzH2) exacerbates the gene's function and help tumor cells to grow.
	- It looks like cancer shuts off genes by targeting the general TAD they're in, rather than trying individual genes, since a TAD contains genes that appear to be related, so it assumes that the gene expression governing genes are located near to each other.
	- It can tell when one of its enabling mutations is in danger or switched off and create a new mutation that re-enables it.
	- EZH2 is normally involved in the repression of gene transcriptionâ€”the first step in gene expression but can be hijacked when mutated to change TADs governing gene associations.
	- cancer targets three major normal processes:
		- gene expression
		- cell division
		- regulatory mechanisms
		- gene protection mechanisms (like shutting off chromatin TADs, since chromatin protects DNA)
	- changing the 3D organization of the chromosome disrupts gene regulation
	- cancer is a process that has cell division as a by-product but its primary useful product is its function transforming energy into different formats, and its function evading deactivation by regulatory systems, which makes it interesting for energy efficiency & bio batteries

Abstract insights:
	- Given the level of finite complexity in our system, cancer is a predictable process, relating to the corruption of certain system components, like instructions (DNA) and regulatory exploit identifiers & rule-enforcers (immune system) with many shared components between opposing agents (energy sources), and many components with shared functionality (many genes controlling growth).
	- This can happen with humans when rules dont align with incentives (people arent paid to be good) - when did the rewards stop for the immune system and DNA-preserving/protecting components? This implies that problem types like cancer occur when there's a distance between required & rewarded behavior, with high agent freedom allowing agents to abandon unrewarding responsibilities.
	- If you have a finite number of components (elements, processing units, microorganism agents, organs), a finite number of types, & a finite number of relationship verbs (convert, split, combine, cooperate), what level of complexity can a system reach?


Questions:
	- is there a way to trigger evolution using stressor & change supply matching?
	- how did we evolve the ability to make certain things & not others?
	- how do types & species evolve? like types of bacteria - is it always an environmental stressor or accidental mutation?
	- can you trigger evolution using stressors in a way that will produce the right bacteria & other resources your body needs?
	- why would the cancer-disabling protein p53 sometimes enable it?
		- cancer acquires all DNA of all cells it encounters & finds a way to use it to its advantage
		- an excessive amount of most substances leads to cancer (either bc of mutations or bc excess indicates to cancer that it should start multiplying cells)
		- it appears it may be coincidentally regressing to a cancer-friendly energy source rather than using a new one, which prevents cancer initiation by protecting the genome from phosphorylation processes that damage it, by switching from phosophorylation (an efficient energy production process in the energy hub, mitochondria) to glycolysis energy processing
		- how can we prevent evolution & distribution of components that use cancer-friendly energy sources? which components have cancer's capacity to adapt to different energy sources, other than bacteria?
	- Since genes are sections of DNA rather than individual base pairs, is it incorrect to think of genes are isolated units?
	- Given that cancer is using genes as a function database, can you implant decoy functions for it to find or manipulate this function base so cancer cant access it as expected?
	- Are genes defined as the position of the region (same position, variable DNA) or the location of the region (same DNA, variable position)?
	- Is a gene necessarily related to a structurally similar (similar base pair & order) or physically adjacent gene (same TAD or on opposite sides of a TAD boundary) or can they be completely unrelated?
	- What percent of system functionality can be rebuilt or executed from interchangeable gene combinations?
	- What impact does the size/position & gene function family of the TAD have on its corruptability or other attributes?
	- Are these common gene changes like eye color resulting from other changes, which is why certain eye colors are associated with different health risks, or is it that some genes go together, and do these associated genes influence mutation patterns?
	- Do these associations act as a trigger, so the removal/change of one automatically influences the other? Are these associations a possible method of deploying gene changes? Like present condition A which triggers gene B, which is positively associated with gene B.
	- How does it communicate info to other cancer cells once it verifies info?
	- Did cancer evolve when there was interference/divergence in the immune system's & DNA protecting components' rewards?
	- Does cancer ever cooperate with the immune system, multiplying mutated cells to direct the immune system's attention to a problem?
	- Is the immune system capable of fixing corrupted DNA, or is there another component capable of that?
	- Is cancer intended for faster evolution within the host organism's life cycle? does it interpret mutations as a positive change?
	- Did cancer evolve to keep the immune system in check when the immune system attacks itself or healthy cells? did it evolve around the same time or in response to autoimmune diseases and allergies?
	- Historically, is there a pattern that usually occurs when this problem type exists in our evolutionary state changes?
	- Given a finite system as described, is there a pattern of changing the system to resolve problems in the problem spaces produced by the original system structure, such as:
		- introducing new component combinations (new chemicals, new mid-level components like enzymes, new light types)
		- changing the relationship between components (making immune & cancer more collaborative - with aligned incentives & tool-sharing - than regulatory)
		- changing the environment in which the system exists (lower oxygen environments which are better for cancer)
	- Enzymes can process energy & other building blocks as well - could you send enzymes to a particular area to rob the tumor of its energy sources as it evolves?
	- Does cancer evolve in the same or predictable patterns when switching between energy sources?
	- Is cancer evolution triggered by known environment changes, like density, bacteria, or radiation?
	- Where is cancer's strategy database? Is it always hijacking other cell's functionality, like using adar1 enzymes? If so, it must have a goal selection & testing function, as well as an ability to test other cells' functions & gene functions, at the minimum
	- How does it select a goal & evaluate its success, and how does it evaluate the functionality of other cells & genes?
	- Does it send inputs to other cells to see what response it gets, or is it trial & error?
	- Does it send mutation tools to other cells and see whether it can cause a particular kind of damage?
	- If so, is there a way to prevent cancer from even reading other cells' DNA or hardening the barriers allowing it to test other cells?
	- What determines the full range of a gene's possible functionality?
	- Does the source mutation/gene of a particular tumor dictate what level of adaptability it has access to?
	- Did the 'errors' in the system like frequent DNA copying errors evolve as a way of triggering adaptation & diversity?
	- What are the best methods of deploying cell changes throughout the system? Is there a set of source cells from which other cells are copied? Can you change the mechanism deciding which cells to copy from?
	- Actually cancer is a great way to deploy cell changes, but it creates new cells & kills healthy cells by stealing their energy supply. If you can create the source mutation causing cancer, and if you can control how cancer copies & modifies that mutation, cancer could be a powerful method for regeneration/healing. Is there any evidence this already happens under certain conditions?
	- Is position of DNA when compressed related to the associated genes?
	- Is there an optimal position of DNA that would prevent adjacency errors?


Future tech:
	- can we regularly shuffle the gene locations in a way that doesn't impact essential functionality, so the cancer shuts off the wrong TAD on a regular basis?
	- can we determine the necessary number of copies of DNA needed for system safety and create reference pointers rather than new copies to reduce mutation risk during copying process?
	- can we prevent uncompressing of DNA and replace it with functions that reveal information about DNA without uncompressing it?
	- is it important to vary your diet & microorganism exposures so your body has to continually adapt to different types of energy processing & can handle all energy processing?
	- rather than coming up with one way to fight the development of cancer, it's more important to come up with a way to generate methods to fight its development since its development patterns change by cancer origination type & environment 
	- this means a method of finding out which components (protein, gene, bacteria, stress) would help which kinds of cancers, which kinds of cancers are likely given which mutations, and developing a method to evaluate success of component combinations to counteract these cancer type-enabling components
