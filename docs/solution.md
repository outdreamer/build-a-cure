# Solution Object

## Attributes

  - types

    - solution generator

    - solution framework (limits reducing solution space)

    - problem decomposer (reduces problem dimensions)

    - interim solution (common components of solutions, like a granular solution strategy)

    - problem metadata manipulation (changes problem space, postpones solving problem, matching problem with other problem to neutralize both)

    - solution function built on core functions:

      - apply
      - derive
      - fit/match

    - problem-type specific (only handles asymmetries or structure-fitting or optimal transport)

    - transforms unsolved problem into solved problem (transforms unsolved problem into an optimization/organization problem)

  - abstraction

### Common solution functions/strategies

  - distort/standardize
  - alternate/stabilize
  - isolate/combine
  - position (arrange)
  - compress/expand
  - transform (change)
  - fit (match/contain/fill structure)
  - differentiate (key points of difference)
  - filter (find: start from everything & reduce)
  - derive (build: start from scratch & build)
  - metadata (minimum information to derive)
  - generate (using limits, interfaces, symmetries, variables)
  - map (physics of limits, combination, calculation, approximation, measurement)
