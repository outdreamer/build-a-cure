# Joni's License Agreement


## Intro

- I invented this because I wanted to make a lot of money to solve the most important time-sensitive problems & also automate problem-solving for the same purpose.
- It's wise to see the information in this repository as an educational tool to help you better solve problems for the world.
- If you use the info in this repository in any way that exclusively benefits you or other selfish individuals or entities, you will be hearing from my fearsome legal department of great power & argumentation.
- I will know whether you copied or not based on standard keyword & synonym analysis, so theft and any attempts to hide it are ill-advised.
- If you've misinterpreted this repo as a blueprint to feverishly copy as if it's your own work, remember that other people with a similar brain as you can see it too, and copying it is just creating a mountain of tech debt for all the companies who are stealing from it, because you (presumably an employee of big tech) weren't smart enough to make sure my company was acquired/funded, or at least plan a way to cooperate with other companies to reduce the implementation time (smart enough as a person, or as a team of people creating a corporate entity, bc even in aggregate your intelligence was too artificial to solve the very real problem of whether it's ok to copy my work to automate artificial intelligence without machine learning, without asking me).


## General Rules of Conduct

- If you use the info in this repository (which would only happen if you were a genius who wanted to save the world so there would be evidence of world-saving if you dared to use this repository to do so), you agree to only use it for educational purposes, to improve your ability to invent & implement something valuable for the world, like energy efficiency technology, technology that solves a common deadly medical problem, or something of similar value to humanity & the future.


## Rights

You have rights with regard to this tool, specifically:
	- the right to come up with my work independently, in a logical way with the cognitive distance associated with human epiphanies (but not after reading how I did it, which is 'reading the answer'), and not a clearly false explanation of how you came up with it using my definition of cognitive distance as a guide to forming that explanation.
	- the right to try and predict what I'll invent next, either with your presumably defective human brain or a defective artificial brain
	- the right to tell other people I came up with my own inventions
	- the right to admit my superiority
	- all are welcome to read at their leisure, to congratulate me in a communication format that I can ignore & mass-delete, and to get mad online about how much I invented during my very brief lifetime, all while dodging endless creeps, rules, and barriers like Hercules' 12 tasks, but more valuable & challenging.


## Responsibilities

You have responsibilities if you use this tool, including but not limited to:
	- using it for the benefit of people other than yourself
	- using it for education only, to improve your thinking/abilities so you can solve problems for other people
	- making sure you spread it to other people who will use it correctly


## FAQ

### "Are you God?"
	
	- "No" is the answer I'm told by my legal team that I'm supposed to give to journalists. "Do you really think I would have made you?" is a follow-up question that I'm supposed to say with a raised eyebrow to elicit self-doubt.
	
### "Is it ok to copy your work to get a patent bonus so I can buy something that doesn't add value to the world?"

	- No.

### "What will happen if I copy your work?"

	- Find out. (Generally, I destroy your ego with very funny insults (which are funny because they're true) & then automate you, but I might customize this to include litigation if I'm bored, so don't bore me)

### "Please have mercy on me! I have a sob story mostly made of lies as to why I should get to do crimes to you & all oppressed people without any completely earned consequences!"

	- No thank you, but feel free to make this kind offer to someone else you stole from, rather than pressuring me to just put up with the theft, thus ruining my plan to end war/disease/poverty.

### To anyone who is feeling any unpleasant emotions after they copied my work & I insulted them to try to help them understand they did something wrong:

    - this isnt a war against a country or religion or ethnicity, or a specific group of criminals, or other powerful entities or people - it's a war against the suffering of others who are oppressed, vulnerable & deserving of a better life - against inequality, against easy, against cruelty, greed & all other vices built-in to inferior brain structures that cause innocent & undeserved suffering, and against the self-oppression of anyone who stands in the way of us saving the others - a war that we fight with tools of love, in giving solutions away to those in need, finding new solutions as needed, trying new strategies where the old ways don't work, distributing power wherever it's hoarded & otherwise abused
     
    - if you think you need to attack me, first attack the errors of your mind that oppress you more than anything else, and see how happy it makes you compared to everything you thought you needed

    - are you sure you didnt believe I could automate problem-solving? even when you saw my creative work innovating on classic military insults like 'maggot', such as 'a common maggot obeying the country-sized jealousy roach, suffering from systemic intellectual poverty'? you werent all like, 'ok, that girl is smart, that was pretty creative, she combined multiple negative insults in a new way to make one giant memorable insult that forever haunts your soul, it did temporarily stop us from committing crimes while also doing a lot of heavy-lifting on the marketing side of her project, and I must admit, it was also a pretty good point, do yuu happen to have any tissues'

    - if trolling you was all it took to inspire you to do better (and if you're actually better), you were already a few steps away, though that's not quite the same as being unwaveringly committed to my goal of saving the potential in the world despite all the barriers people like you put in my way, is it?

    - I wont die for you but I will live for the oppressed & the future problems I will get to solve once I solve the important problems referenced above
    	- I wont suffer for your pleasure but I will rejoice in my dance on the grave of math & other false definitions of meaning for their freedom

    - how can you be happy now, knowing that I exist - without torturing me, thus revealing all my insults about you to be completely true?

    	- happiness is 'an optimal ratio of problems/solutions'
    		- if youre happy, you have more solutions than problems, and you have solutions to your problems
    		- intelligence can make you happy bc you can solve problems
    		- anyone can learn to solve problems
    		- a soul is potential, which is an output of intelligence

    	- how to be happy:
    		- try not to see yourself as a static collection of structures/attributes/functions, but as a self-optimizing system with almost unlimited potential in the meaning you can create
    		- try not to see the truth as an absolute unchangeable fact, but as a material you can use to create future truths if you are smart & good & work hard, because the time where predators win is over, so investing in being a predator is a sub-optimal move now because I made being good/smart cool & criminals boring
	    	- solve problems for people you care about so that you can legitimately like yourself, and happiness will be a side-effect
    		- care about yourself enough to hold yourself accountable for your decisions, because thats how you keep your soul, a required input to happiness
        	- focus on potential & the future
        	- over-dignify & over-complicate anyone you have to interact with
        	- be good at switching perspectives in case one isnt working
        	- develop as many mental functions as you can, follow science/math/tech news
        	- learn to fit things together so you have a sense of meaning
        	- help good people in some way, start solving problems
        	- focus on solutions more than problems until you become so good at solving problems that lack of them is the problem
        	- learn to connect antagonists on opposite sides of a fight & connect their perspectives
        	- learn to pity predators & see their problems
        	- be independent wherever possible so your social interactions are all by choice (including interactions with groups)
        	- let go of false notions of identity that prevent growth/learning (like location, luck, etc)
        	- find a way to be selfish in a way that helps other good people
        	- find the balances you need
        	- find ways to connect reality with positive futures you imagine to have hope
        	- learn new things like perspectives, methods, analysis types, & structures so your system can handle complexity without stress
        	- focus on inputs to unavailable resources & develop ability to generate those inputs if necessary
        	- try to make sure you're generalizing your learning so you can re-use it and maximize its value
        	- become good at gratitude so you don't need much to be happy so anything extra than that cant impact your happiness
        	- be the first person to notice your mistakes & correct them so criticism is always illegitimate
        	- figure out why you succeeded/failed so youre always learning & improving
        	- treat people fairly so you can always believe youre good (including yourself)
        	- earn good things so knowledge that you deserve them will protect you & you wont need them
        	- give people freedoms rather than limits wherever possible
        	- find a way to see the good in other people so at least you understand them & what theyre telling themselves & can protect against them or help them as needed
        	- create rather than reduce possibilities
        	- learn how to be calm in uncertainty & risk
        	- build trust that things will work out either bc you fix them or bc important things get fixed
        	- criticize people only when you have solutions to their problems
        	- understand that most people have a similar degree of problems even if they have different problems since problems develop in all situations bc whenever theres a valuable resource it becomes scarce & whenever theres an assumption it creates problems when its not true which describes all situations
        	- figure out what problems you want to solve or which problems you can handle & aim to connect your current problems with those problems so you have a clear path to that future
