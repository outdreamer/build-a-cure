9 Protease inhibitors

10. alkaloids: contain a nitrogen atom

	- amino acid peptides, proteins, nucleotides, nucleic acid, amines, and antibiotics can contain nitrogen but are usually not called alkaloids
	- functions
		- antimalarial (e.g. quinine), antiasthma (e.g. ephedrine)
		- anticancer (e.g. homoharringtonine)
		- cholinomimetic (e.g. galantamine)
		- vasodilatory (e.g. vincamine)
		- antiarrhythmic (e.g. quinidine)
		- analgesic (e.g. morphine)
		- antibacterial (e.g. chelerythrine)
		- antihyperglycemic activities (e.g. piperine)
		- psychotropic (e.g. psilocin)
		- stimulant activities (e.g. cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, theobromine)

11. antinutrients (interfere with absorption/use of nutrients)

	- strong reducing acids (oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid) 
		- can have antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and preventing them from being absorbed

	- Phytic acid (nuts, seeds, grains)
		- has a strong binding affinity to minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc

	- Protease inhibitors: inhibit the actions of trypsin, pepsin and other proteases in the gut, preventing the digestion and subsequent absorption of protein

	- Lipase inhibitors: interfere with enzymes, such as human pancreatic lipase, that catalyze the hydrolysis of some lipids, including fats. 

	- Amylase inhibitors (beans like white kidney beans): prevent the action of enzymes that break the glycosidic bonds of starches and other complex carbohydrates, preventing the release of simple sugars and absorption by the body

	- Oxalic acid/oxalates (rhubarb, tea, spinach, parsley and purslane): bind to calcium

	- Glucosinolates (broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, mustard greens, radishes, cauliflower): prevent the uptake of iodine, affecting the function of the thyroid and thus are considered goitrogens

	- Excessive intake of required nutrients can also result in them having an anti-nutrient action. Excessive intake of dietary fiber can reduce the transit time through the intestines to such a degree that other nutrients cannot be absorbed
	- high calcium with iron can decrease the absorption of iron through inhibition of iron transport protein hDMT1

	- Some proteins can also be antinutrients
		- trypsin inhibitors and lectins found in legumes, which interfere with digestion
		- Avidin is an antinutrient found in active form in raw egg whites, which binds to biotin (vitamin B7), and can cause deficiency of B7

	- flavonoids, which are a group of polyphenolic compounds that include tannins, which chelate metals such as iron & zinc, reducing their absorption, & also inhibit digestive enzymes & precipitate proteins

	- Saponins in plants may act like antifeedants and can be classified as antinutrients 


	- antimetabolite: a chemical that inhibits the use of a metabolite
		- competitive inhibition: occurs with structural similarity between anti/metabolite (antifolates that interfere with the use of folic acid)
		- can have toxic effects on cells, such as halting cell growth and cell division
		- used to inhibit cell division/growth, as antibiotics, & decrease fibrosis

12. antioxidants (inhibit oxidation)

	- beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer

	- examples
		Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
		Glutathione
		Lipoic acid
		Uric acid
		Carotenes
		retinol (vitamin a)
		α-Tocopherol
		Ubiquinol (coenzyme Q)
