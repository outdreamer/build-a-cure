# Test cases

## Conditions

	- Identify the processes & bio markers related to the condition as you go through search results so you can do secondary searches
		- target metric to inhibit/increase
		- cooperative metrics: synergistic compounds that enhance the effect of drugs without debilitating side effects
			- search for these & the stressors that deactivate/activate them
				Example: MUC1 - bacteria exposed to a split tail activates it
		- antagonistic metrics: any compounds that can neutralize the drug & the supplements/foods that contain them
			- get these inhibitors by looking up existing treatment pharmacokinetics/dynamics & interactions
				- search for inhibit, induce, substrate
				- check for synergistic effects & any effects that prevent the drug from being metabolized, which may be required to activate it
				- once you find a treatment, you need to check it against context provided by user to filter the list of treatments or style it differently
		- metrics further up the causal stack 
			- if you decrease hunger, diabetes doesnt happen, which is also a treatment (fasting)

### I. diabetes 

	- treatments should include: 
		- amylase & glucosidase inhibitors (caffeoyl, galloyl, and prenyl groups)
		- berberine
		- carb blockers like white kidney bean extract
		- insulin
		- fasting
		- sweet defeat (sugar taste blockers)
		- as well as any compounds that can target the processes/receptors involved (ghrelin, metabolism, dopamine, GLUT-4 receptor) 

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- inhibit glucose absorption 
		- insulin-mimicking activity
		- enhanced glucose uptake
		- regulation of insulin signaling pathways
		- translocation of GLUT-4 receptor 
		- activation of the PPARγ

### II. fungal meningitis 

	- treatments should include:
		- carvacrol, thymol, eugenol
		- ecgc
		- inhibitors of CYP51 (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4)
		- alternate routes to cyp51 outputs: 
			- depletion of ergosterol and ergosta-7-enol
			- accumulation of eburicol, obtusifolione, and lanosterol/obtusifoliol
		- azole drugs
		- imidazoles
		- sertraline
		- insight path for serotonin-imidazole:
			- serotonin, which play an important role in higher animals, are similar to alkaloids in their structure and biosynthesis and are sometimes called alkaloids
			- amino acids are precursors to some alkaloids
			- some amino acids have synergistic effects to kill the pathogen (histidine, carnosine, lysine)
			- alkaloid-related substances as serotonin, dopamine and histamine are important neurotransmitters so may impact meningitis
			- alkaloids have imidazole ring 
			- imidazoles are a subset of azoles that have fewer side effects

		- should pull drugs & drug types (like statin/alkylamine/sterol enzyme/terpene) from studies mentioning alternative strategies like: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC89924/

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- convert ergosterol to vitamin d
		- bind to ergosterol to break fungal cell membrane
		- any other substances that can bind with or permeate the fungal cell membrane or process ergosterol into something harmless
		- inhibit other links in chain allowing ergosterol to be constructed/protected:
			 "inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase, squalene epoxide-lanosterol cyclase, lanosterol demethylase, Δ8 to Δ7 isomerase, and S-adenosylmethionine:sterol methyltransferase"

	- insights should include:
		- inhibits [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] in fungus but not mammals
		- inhibiting [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] prevents production of ergosterol from lanosterol & accumulation of [14α-methyl] sterols
		- ergosterol is a required input of the fungal cell membrane
		- breaking cell components [membranes] is a way to kill an organism
		- once you break the membrane, your system can handle the components of the cell
		- required inputs (enzymes) to inputs (ergosterol) of object components [cell membranes] are a key target to break those components
			(this insight should already exist in your insight db without those specifics)
		- some natural processes break cell membranes

	- standard system analysis questions should include:
		- what are the limits of your system handling broken fungal cells?
		- does combination therapy work (convert ergosterol to vitamin d & prevent ergosterol production) without system damage?

	- drug attributes should include:

	- SGLT2 inhibitors decrease blood sugar by causing the kidneys to remove sugar from the body through the urine. 
	  - enhance blood sugar control as well as reduce body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[5]
	  Research on medicines in this class have shown they also can reduce the risk of heart failure, slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and reduce risk of cardiovascular death. 
	- GLP-1 RAs work by simulating the functions of the body's natural incretin hormones that help lower post-meal blood sugar levels. 
	  The medicines in this group have been shown to reduce the risks of heart attack, ischemic stroke and/or cardiovascular death.

	  - coffee, argan oil, sunflower, thyme, sage, spearmint, yerba mate
	- valproic acid
	  - Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) like valproic acid have anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects
	  - valproic acid before kidney injury prevented the development of proteinuria and the onset of glomerulosclerosis. 
	  - Even after postponing treatment until the peak of adriamycin-induced proteinuria, valproic acid rapidly decreased the quantity of proteinuria and attenuated the progression of renal disease. 
	  - Valproic acid abrogated the decrease in glomerular acetylation observed during adriamycin-induced nephropathy. 
	  - Furthermore, valproic acid attenuated the significant upregulation of profibrotic and proinflammatory genes, the deposition of collagen, and the infiltration of macrophages into the kidney
	- vitamin u (counters valproic acid)
	  - Collectively, these data show that VPA is a promoter of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis which resulted in renal damage. Vit U can be proposed as a potential candidate for preventing renal damage which arose during the therapeutic usage of VPA. 
	- blue-green algae
	  - lowers blood pressure
	  - reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting NF-κB pathway in macrophages and splenocytes - Sulfate polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory, antitumor, antithrombotic, anticoagulant, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and even antiviral activity

- test metrics

	- BUN is an indication of renal (kidney) health. The normal range is 2.1–7.1 mmol/L or 6–20 mg/dL.
    - Creatinine is a waste product in your blood that’s made by muscle activity. Normally, it’s removed from your blood by your kidneys. But if your kidneys stop working, your creatinine level rises.
    - Urea nitrogen is another waste product in your blood. It’s created when protein from the foods is broken down. Like creatinine, your kidneys remove this from your blood. When your kidneys stop working, your urea nitrogen levels rise.
    - Serum potassium is a substance found in your blood that balances water levels in your bloodstream. Kidney disease can cause either high or low potassium levels. 
    - Serum sodium is another substance in your blood that helps with fluid balance in your body.  High sodium levels can mean that your kidneys aren’t working properly because your body can’t get rid of the right amount of sodium.
  	- A high urine pH may be due to: Kidneys that do not properly remove acids (kidney tubular acidosis, also known as renal tubular acidosis)
  	- microalbumin: blood in urine, hematuria
  	- High urine specific gravity can indicate that you have extra substances in your urine, such as: glucose. protein. bilirubin. red blood cells. white blood cells. crystals. bacteria.

- symptoms
     Fluid buildup. Acute kidney failure can sometimes cause a buildup of fluid in your body. If fluid builds up in your lungs, this can cause shortness of breath.
	Chest pain. If the lining that covers your heart  becomes inflamed, you may have chest pain.
	Acidic blood (metabolic acidosis). If your blood has too much acid due to acute kidney failure, you can end up with nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and breathlessness.
	Muscle weakness. When your body's fluids and electrolytes are out of balance, you can get  muscle weakness.  In serious cases, this can lead to paralysis and heart rhythm problems.
    Lethargy
    Weakness
    Shortness of breath
    Generalized swelling (edema)
    Generalized weakness due to anemia
    Loss of appetite
    Lethargy
    Fatigue
    Congestive heart failure
    Metabolic acidosis
    High blood potassium (hyperkalemia)
    Fatal heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation
    Rising urea levels in the blood (uremia) may lead to brain encephalopathy, pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining), or low calcium blood levels (hypocalcemia)
	Inability to remove potassium from the bloodstream may lead to abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death

	    - Angiotensin_II_receptor_blocker
	      - Angiotensin_II_receptor_blocker main uses are in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage due to diabetes) and congestive heart failure. 
	      - may worsen kidney functions such as reducing glomerular filtration rate associated with a rise of serum creatinine
    - ace inhibitor
      - ACEi have been shown to decrease erythropoietin production, help kidney function
      - Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone level
      - ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium
      - ACE inhibitors, but not for other RAAS blockers, is an increase in bradykinin level
      - ACE inhibitor usually have a modest reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
        - Reduced GFR is especially a problem if the patient is concomitantly taking an NSAID and a diuretic.
          When the three drugs are taken together, the risk of developing renal failure is significantly increased.[20]
    - angiotensin: a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. 
      It is part of the renin–angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure. 
      Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex to promote sodium retention by the kidneys
  	- beta blockers (reduce heart rate)
  	- diuretic (fluid retention)
  	- aldosterone antagonist
	- creatine, taurine, D-ribose
	- triptolide enhanced calcium restoration, curcumin inhibited ERK & p-STAT3 pathways, ginkolide B inhibited Ras/MAPK pathway, and steviol activated AMPK, which inhibited CFTR channel and mTOR pathway
