# Test cases

## Conditions

	- Identify the processes & bio markers related to the condition as you go through search results so you can do secondary searches
		- target metric to inhibit/increase
		- cooperative metrics: synergistic compounds that enhance the effect of drugs without debilitating side effects
			- search for these & the stressors that deactivate/activate them
				Example: MUC1 - bacteria exposed to a split tail activates it
		- antagonistic metrics: any compounds that can neutralize the drug & the supplements/foods that contain them
			- get these inhibitors by looking up existing treatment pharmacokinetics/dynamics & interactions
				- search for inhibit, induce, substrate
				- check for synergistic effects & any effects that prevent the drug from being metabolized, which may be required to activate it
				- once you find a treatment, you need to check it against context provided by user to filter the list of treatments or style it differently
		- metrics further up the causal stack 
			- if you decrease hunger, diabetes doesnt happen, which is also a treatment (fasting)

### I. diabetes 

	- treatments should include: 
		- amylase & glucosidase inhibitors (caffeoyl, galloyl, and prenyl groups)
		- berberine
		- carb blockers like white kidney bean extract
		- insulin
		- fasting
		- sweet defeat (sugar taste blockers)
		- as well as any compounds that can target the processes/receptors involved (ghrelin, metabolism, dopamine, GLUT-4 receptor) 

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- inhibit glucose absorption 
		- insulin-mimicking activity
		- enhanced glucose uptake
		- regulation of insulin signaling pathways
		- translocation of GLUT-4 receptor 
		- activation of the PPARγ

### II. fungal meningitis 

	- treatments should include:
		- carvacrol, thymol, eugenol
		- ecgc
		- inhibitors of CYP51 (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4)
		- alternate routes to cyp51 outputs: 
			- depletion of ergosterol and ergosta-7-enol
			- accumulation of eburicol, obtusifolione, and lanosterol/obtusifoliol
		- azole drugs
		- imidazoles
		- sertraline
		- insight path for serotonin-imidazole:
			- serotonin, which play an important role in higher animals, are similar to alkaloids in their structure and biosynthesis and are sometimes called alkaloids
			- amino acids are precursors to some alkaloids
			- some amino acids have synergistic effects to kill the pathogen (histidine, carnosine, lysine)
			- alkaloid-related substances as serotonin, dopamine and histamine are important neurotransmitters so may impact meningitis
			- alkaloids have imidazole ring 
			- imidazoles are a subset of azoles that have fewer side effects

		- should pull drugs & drug types (like statin/alkylamine/sterol enzyme/terpene) from studies mentioning alternative strategies like: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC89924/

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- convert ergosterol to vitamin d
		- bind to ergosterol to break fungal cell membrane
		- any other substances that can bind with or permeate the fungal cell membrane or process ergosterol into something harmless
		- inhibit other links in chain allowing ergosterol to be constructed/protected:
			 "inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase, squalene epoxide-lanosterol cyclase, lanosterol demethylase, Δ8 to Δ7 isomerase, and S-adenosylmethionine:sterol methyltransferase"

	- insights should include:
		- inhibits [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] in fungus but not mammals
		- inhibiting [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] prevents production of ergosterol from lanosterol & accumulation of [14α-methyl] sterols
		- ergosterol is a required input of the fungal cell membrane
		- breaking cell components [membranes] is a way to kill an organism
		- once you break the membrane, your system can handle the components of the cell
		- required inputs (enzymes) to inputs (ergosterol) of object components [cell membranes] are a key target to break those components
			(this insight should already exist in your insight db without those specifics)
		- some natural processes break cell membranes

	- standard system analysis questions should include:
		- what are the limits of your system handling broken fungal cells?
		- does combination therapy work (convert ergosterol to vitamin d & prevent ergosterol production) without system damage?

	- drug attributes should include:
		- fungistatic
		- fungicidal (cryptococcus)
		- soluble in water & alcohol
		- stressor for kidneys
		- 90% excreted in urine & sweat, 10% metabolized

### III. cancer

	- relevant processes/attributes/systems:
		- communication, stressor distribution, & boundaries
		- immune system 
		- system & process error types

	- treatments should include:
		- anthrax for bladder cancer
		- known cancer drugs

	- treatment strategies should include:
	  	- promote circulation in the organ (like caffeoquinone acid in the liver) to increasee cell communication, or push them to a place with greater blood flow or cell communication
	  	- identity set of stressors to activate helpful cell division
	  	- need a way to detect tumors using existing bio metrics
	  	- isolate tumors with a compound that they will interpret as the boundary of the host so they dont replicate further
	  	- make a list of anti-inflammatories & fit them to the stressor model
	  	- determine which organisms can borrow genes & look for link to cancer
	  	- determine the ratio of stress that optimizes learning without killing the host; ideally the solution would use the extra cell division potential to make useful cells
	  	- make a list of the common types of error the immune system makes (h pylori, cancer) & figure out if adjusting immune system function is the best layer to attack from

### IV. Liver function

	- apple cider vinegar
	- d-mannose
	- bethanechol can stimulate the nerves of the bladder, making them more responsive to stimulus
	- prelief is a dietary supplement that works as an acid blocker for the bladder
	- water mixed with tea tree oil can help flush out the urinary tract and connective tissue, limiting your chances of developing a nasty urinary tract infection

	- eat:
	  - fruit & vegetables with vitamin c & get enough vitamin d
	  - vegetables (broccoli, squash, kale, green beans, potatoes, lettuce, soy, celery, garlic)
	  - lean proteins (turkey, chicken, fish, eggs)

	      grapes, guava, peaches, prunes, plums, strawberries, pineapples,
	      cranberries (unless youre trying to clear an infection), 
	      tomatoes, onions, rye bread, fava beans, lentils, lima beans, nuts
	    )
	  - acidic condiments (vinegar, spicy seasoning, mayonnaise, soy sauce)
	  - weird or high-salt meat (corned beef, chicken liver, pickled herring)
	  - dairy (except probiotic yogurt if it doesnt bother you)
	  - excessive salt
	  - any sugar other than from low-acid fruit

	- essential oils found associated with stimulating bladder:
	  - Oregano Oil

	  - bitter leafy greens such as dandelion, chicory and arugula also may promote liver function by reducing congestion because they stimulate bile flow
	  - diuretic (celery, parsley, dandelion root, cucumber, asparagus, eggplant, watercress, artichokes and watermelon)
	  - sulfur is especially beneficial for your liver because it detoxifies medication substances, pesticides & other environmental toxins
	    foods rich in sulfur include onions, garlic & cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage & brussels sprouts)
	    the primary medicinal compound in garlic is called allicin, a strong antimicrobial that also deters infections
	  - antioxidants eliminate free radicals, which reduce tissue damage & allow the organs & blood vessels to properly heal
	    vitamins C & E, beta-carotene & flavonoids are powerful antioxidants found in citrus fruits, berries, dark-colored grapes, apples, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, spinach & asparagus
	  - vitamin C also helps to dissolve calcium buildup in the kidneys
	  - b. rotunda fingerroot has the potential to successfully treat liver cirrhosis in humans & diuresis (excess urine), dysentery and abdominal pain 

	- essential oils for liver:
		- rosemary: cleans the blood & flushes harmful toxins from the liver, stimulates bile production & flow which aids digestion, treats liver problems (cirrhosis & jaundice)
		- german chamomile: stimulates liver & gall bladder which helps digestion & cleans the blood
